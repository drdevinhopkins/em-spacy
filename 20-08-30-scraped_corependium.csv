"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
When a ruptured AA is suspected, consider immediate bedside U/S in the unstable patient, or CT angiography if the patient is stable.
Intraperitoneal rupture will lead to intra-abdominal free fluid on U/S.
Retroperitoneal rupture may be difficult to identify on U/S; therefore, in the correct clinical context, an aneurysmal aorta on U/S should be considered ruptured until proven otherwise.
Obtain adequate IV access (at least two large-bore IVs), type, and crossmatch.
Consider arterial line placement.
Early vascular surgery consultation:
If the aorta is ruptured, the patient should be considered critical regardless of hemodynamics and immediate operative intervention should be pursued.
A delay in surgical care increases the likelihood of mortality.
The goal is 90 min from initial patient contact to operative intervention.
If an interfacility transfer is required, then the goal remains 90 min until operative intervention, although in practice this goal may prove significantly more difficult to achieve.
Resuscitation parameters:
Avoid crystalloid resuscitation given the risk of dilutional coagulopathy and iatrogenic acidosis, unless the patient is in profound shock.
Permissive hypotension, within reason, is acceptable to avoid exacerbating hemorrhage.
The goal is an SBP of 70-90 mm Hg while the patient remains conscious.
Administer blood products if the patient is in shock.
Avoid intubation unless respiratory compromise is present due to the risk of cardiovascular collapse with induction.
Key Concepts
Acute aortic disorders include aortic dissections (AD), aortic aneurysms (AA), intramural hematomas, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers, and injuries sustained by trauma (transection, penetrating injury). This chapter focuses primarily on AA. Traumatic aortic injuries are covered in another chapter. (See Chapter: Blunt Thoracic Trauma) (See Chapter: Penetrating Thoracic Trauma)
The aortic wall is composed of 3 contiguous tissue layers in sequence from the vessel lumen moving outward: intima, media, adventitia.
AA involves dilation of all 3 layers of the arterial wall. An aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of an arterial vessel to at least 50% larger than its expected normal diameter.
Outcomes for patients with acute aortic disorders are heavily dependent on timely diagnosis and intervention, whether surgical or medical.
An AA is a true aneurysm, meaning that the localized dilation involves all 3 layers of the arterial wall (intima, media, and adventitia).
The normal abdominal aorta Figure (infrarenal) measures 2.0 cm in diameter. An abdominal aorta measuring >3.0 cm is considered aneurysmal.
A pseudoaneurysm communicates with the arterial lumen but not with the normal vessel wall. A pseudoaneurysm is contained only by the adventitia or surrounding soft tissue.
An aortoenteric fistula can occur either when an unrepaired AA erodes into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (very rare) or as a late complication of an aortic graft placement (rare), which leads to a similar fistula.
An arteriovenous fistula, most commonly observed within the vena cava, occurs from inflammation leading to adherence to an adjacent vein.
The classic triad of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) includes abdominal pain, hypotension, and pulsatile mass.
The most common and clinically significant complication of AAA is rupture. Once the patient is symptomatic, rupture either has occurred or is imminent.
Most ruptured AAAs have a diameter >5 cm.
In addition to rupture, clinical presentation can involve occlusion of the aorta and/or embolization from the aorta.
The prevalence of AAA is difficult to determine because such instances are commonly asymptomatic. Most AAAs are diagnosed either incidentally or when rupture occurs.
Of patients who sustain a rupture prior to ED arrival, more than 50% die from sudden cardiovascular collapse. The survival rate decreases by 1% per minute prior to arrival.
Even in patients with a history of endovascular repair, the risk of rupture remains.
Endoleak can occur after repair in as many as 20% of patients.
Bedside U/S can be an important tool for the rapid recognition and identification of AAA. The presence of free fluid suggests rupture in the appropriate clinical setting.
For the stable patient, CT can be performed to allow for more clear operative planning.
Preoperative hypotension is a predictor of poor surgical outcome.
Key Diagnostic Elements
The classic triad of an AAA includes abdominal pain, hypotension, and pulsatile mass.
Despite the classical teaching, patients rarely have all 3 features of the classic triad, and some patients have none.
Risk factors include male sex, smoking, increasing age, family history, history of connective tissue diseases, infection, trauma, and arteritis.
Delayed diagnosis is common.
Without rupture, patients may have chronic non-specific or colicky abdominal pain.
With rupture, the pain is often constant, severe, acute, and difficult to localize.
Physical Examination
Hypotension is often a late, and ominous, finding that can lead to initial misdiagnosis.
In AAA rupture, the presence or absence of distal pulses is variable dependent on the patient’s hemodynamic status. In aortic occlusion or thrombosis, distal pulses may be absent.
Microemboli may obstruct small distal vessels, leading to livedo reticularis.Photo
Aortoenteric fistula may present as a massive GI hemorrhage.
Arteriovenous fistula may present as high-output congestive heart failure.
Diagnostic Testing
U/S Image has high sensitivity for the detection of AAAs.
Conduct a rapid bedside test in the unstable patient.
Body habitus and user skill are limitations in U/S testing for AAAs.
Free fluid identification can suggest intraperitoneal rupture, but the absence of free fluid cannot reliably rule out rupture (especially if retroperitoneal).
CT Image is the test of choice for patients who are stable enough to undergo imaging.
Contrast is not necessary to identify a rupture but does allow more accurate sizing and distinction of the patent lumen from mural thrombus.
CT has a significantly higher sensitivity for identifying retroperitoneal bleeding than U/S.
Conventional angiography and MRA are not appropriate choices for the time-sensitive evaluation of potential aneurysms in the ED.
Treatment - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Assess the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation.
Avoid intubation whenever possible as induction can lead to cardiovascular collapse.
Resuscitate the patient to a targeted SBP between 70 and 90 mm Hg with intact mental status.
Obtain two large-bore peripheral IVs.
Type and crossmatch the patient for blood products.
Ensure that the patient is NPO.
Provide analgesia as blood pressure allows.
Consider arterial line placement.
Pursue immediate vascular surgery consultation or transfer the patient to the closest facility with vascular surgery capabilities.
Reverse any anticoagulants, if possible and applicable.
Disposition
Home
Patients who are asymptomatic with incidental discovery of AAA can be considered for discharge only when it is clear that the patient’s presenting symptoms are not related to the AAA.
Outpatient follow-up instructions and education should be provided.
Admission
Any patient who is acutely symptomatic without rupture should be considered for admission.
A symptomatic AAA may suddenly deteriorate at any time.
OR/Surgery
All patients with an acute rupture require immediate operative management.
Once ruptured, AAA is fatal unless treated surgically.
Even with surgery, the mortality rate of AAA is still very high.
Delays in operative repair increase the likelihood of mortality.
In the asymptomatic patient with findings of an incidental AAA without rupture, operative intervention depends on the AAA size and patient risk factors. AAA larger than 5 cm in diameter, or those with a rapidly expanding diameter, carry increased risk of rupture, and elective repair should be considered.

Background
Epidemiology
The prevalence of AAA is directly related to age, with an overall estimated prevalence of 1.4% in the population aged 50 to 85 y. 
Male sex, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, age, family history of AAA, and excess weight are associated with an increased risk of aneurysm. 
Protective factors include Hispanic, African-American, and Asian race/ethnicity as well as smoking cessation, fruit and vegetable or nut consumption, and regular exercise. 
Despite accounting for only 20% of AAAs, approximately one-third of ruptures and nearly the same number of deaths occur in women as men, likely due to a delay in diagnosis. 
AAA rupture is associated with a high overall mortality of 85% to 90%. Of those who arrive alive to the hospital, only 50% to 70% survive to hospital discharge. 
Pathophysiology
The loss of elastin and collagen leads to destruction of the aortic media and lamina, allowing for rupture. 
This destructive process occurs with aging and can be accelerated by exposures, such as long-term tobacco smoking.
The risk of rupture is directly proportional to the aneurysm size: 
<4 cm: 0% risk of rupture per year
4-5 cm: 0.5%-5% risk of rupture per year
5-6 cm: 3%-15% risk of rupture per year
6-7 cm: 10%-20% risk of rupture per year
7-8 cm: 20%-40% risk of rupture per year
>8 cm: 30%-50% risk of rupture per year
A rapid increase in aneurysm size, >1 cm per year, is also considered to increase the risk of rupture. 
Symptomatic AAAs are also at increased risk of rupture.
AAA ruptures are of two types:
Contained rupture: Aorta ruptures into the retroperitoneal space, which creates a tamponade effect at the rupture site. Often presents as back pain. Because the rupture is contained, it often allows the patient’s blood pressure to stabilize temporarily.
Free rupture: Aorta ruptures into the peritoneum, leading to rapid exsanguination, shock, and/or death.
Less commonly, an aortoenteric fistula or aortocaval fistula can occur:
An unrepaired AAA erodes into the GI tract or inferior vena cava.
A repaired AAA, by either traditional surgical graft or endograft, forms a fistula.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Although AAA is classically described as a triad of acute abdominal or back pain, hypotension, and pulsatile abdominal mass, in actuality only 57% of patients with a ruptured AAA present with acute abdominal or back pain and shock. 
Unruptured AAA may present as dull and vague abdominal or back discomfort.
Acute, severe abdominal or back pain may suggest imminent or acute rupture.
Severe back or flank pain is related to aortic rupture into the retroperitoneal space. Pain may radiate into the testes, inguinal canal, rectum, or hip. 
Severe abdominal pain or abdominal distention may be encountered if the AA ruptures into the peritoneum.
A pulsatile abdominal mass may be palpated. However, only 69% of patients with a ruptured AAA present with this finding. 
Most patients will have normal femoral pulses. Abnormal pulses may be related to occlusion or hemorrhagic shock associated with rupture.
Rarely, an aortoenteric fistula can develop, leading to brisk GI bleeding, or an aortocaval fistula can form, leading to acute heart failure symptoms. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Plain radiography has been supplanted by U/S and CT as the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing AAA. Abdominal radiographs may identify the presence of AAA when more advanced imaging modalities are not available.
Bedside U/S by emergency medicine physicians can be 99% sensitive and 98% specific for identifying individuals with AAA, with exams typically requiring less than 5 min. 
Although bedside U/S can diagnose an AAA, it is a poor discriminatory test between a non-ruptured and ruptured AAA, with a sensitivity of approximately 4% for ruptured AAA. The presence of an AAA upon bedside U/S coupled with abdominal pain and unstable hemodynamics may be helpful in correctly identifying patients who require emergency operative intervention. 
CT of the abdominal aorta is the diagnostic study of choice for identifying abdominal aortic rupture.  Non-contrast CT is suitable for making a diagnosis of AAA or identifying retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with rupture. CT for the diagnosis of retroperitoneal blood associated with AAA is approximately 77% to 79% sensitive. 
CT angiography with IV contrast is the preferred imaging modality for operative planning to determine whether an open or endovascular repair is appropriate. 
Although a ruptured AAA is clearly a time-sensitive diagnosis, avoiding CT given the fear of morbidity and mortality associated with delays in operative intervention are, to a certain extent, unfounded.
87.5% of patients survive their first 2 h after presenting to a hospital with aortic rupture, according to a retrospective case series. 
Consensus statements from both the Society for Vascular Surgery and European Society for Vascular Surgery support obtaining CT angiography of the abdominal aorta with the exception of a patient who is considered to be hemodynamically unstable for imaging. 
Using a sustained SBP of <80 mm Hg as a trigger to defer CT angiography may be appropriate. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Hematologic investigations do not have a primary role in the diagnosis of acute rupture of an AAA. However, such investigations may suggest an alternative diagnosis.
Patients presenting with signs or symptoms of a ruptured AAA should have a CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, and a type and screen sent.
Therapeutic Considerations
A ruptured AAA is a surgical emergency and requires expeditious diagnosis and operative intervention. The door-to-intervention time should be less than 90 min. 
Established algorithms for the management of patients presenting with ruptured AAA can reduce the 30-d mortality from 32% to 18%. 
Patients with ruptured AAA may present to the ED in cardiovascular collapse. Contemporary management guidelines support the use of permissive hypotension with target SBP of 70-90 mm Hg accompanied by intact mentation. 
Avoid the induction of anesthesia and endotracheal tube placement in the ED because vasodilation associated with induction can lead to sudden, profound hypotension.  Endovascular repair can be performed using local anesthesia and sedation rather than general anesthesia.
Controversy currently exists regarding the pharmacologic lowering of blood pressure in individuals with ruptured AAA. European recommendations suggest that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antihypertensive agents to reduce SBP.  Conversely, North American guidelines suggest short-acting agents such as esmolol, nitroglycerin, or sodium nitroprusside as reasonable medications to initiate if the patient is hypertensive.  Collaboration with vascular surgery and anesthesia is indicated in these situations.
Blood products, rather than crystalloid or colloid solutions, are the resuscitation fluids of choice in a ruptured AAA. A 1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells to fresh frozen plasma appears to reduce the risk of mortality. 
For symptomatic AAA without rupture, admission to an ICU before operative intervention for medical optimization prior to anesthesia can be considered. 
Asymptomatic AAA measuring 5.5 cm or larger in diameter should be repaired in an elective fashion with the use of appropriate preoperative risk stratification beforehand. 
AAA can be repaired in an endovascular fashion via the deployment of a stent graft or in a traditional open procedure through either an abdominal or retroperitoneal incision.
Pooled observational studies demonstrate 30-d mortality rates associated with the repair of ruptured AAA as 26.8% for endovascular repair or 39.6% for open repair. 
This difference has not been replicated in randomized controlled trials.
Insufficient evidence currently exists to support the routine use of risk prediction scores to determine which patients are amenable to operative intervention versus those appropriate for palliative measures only. 
A preoperative scoring system (Harborview Medical Center AAA score) was recently derived and identifies an age greater than 76 y, creatinine concentration >2.0 mg/dL, SBP <70 mm Hg at any time, or a pH <7.2 as being risk factors for mortality.  The 30-d mortality was 100% if an individual had all 4 risk factors. This risk stratification system requires validation prior to routine use in clinical practice.
Management of the Incidental Finding of AAA
With the increasing use of cross-sectional imaging modalities, incidental findings not related to a patient’s complaint are becoming more prevalent.
The Society for Vascular Surgery provides a best practice recommendation that at the time of identification of AAA, patients should be referred to a vascular surgeon.  Therefore, any patients with an abdominal aorta measuring greater than 3.0 cm in diameter should be referred to Vascular Surgery for outpatient follow-up. There is limited guidance regarding referral beyond this; however, consideration should be given to expedited Vascular Surgery consultation for individuals with an abdominal aorta measuring greater than 5.0 cm if not currently under surveillance.
At the time of AAA identification, smoking cessation counselling should be provided because smoking cessation is likely to reduce the rate of aneurysmal growth by 20%. 
Care of Patients Following the Repair of AAA
Major complications that can occur in either open or endovascular repair of an AAA include aortoenteric fistula, graft infection, limb occlusion, and para-anastomotic aneurysm formation. Complications exclusive to endovascular repair include endoleak and device migration. Evaluation for the complication of AAA repair is best completed with a CT scan with contrast.
Aortoenteric fistula:
Aortoenteric fistula represents a rare cause of GI bleeding following AAA repair, with the fistula typically being aortoduodenal; however, cases involving both the small and large bowel have been reported. The typical presentation is a herald upper GI bleed followed by rapid exsanguination. The diagnosis can be confirmed with upper GI endoscopy or CT angiography. 
Repair is typically performed in an open fashion, although endovascular strategies may be used to temporize bleeding prior to an open operative intervention. 
Graft infection:
Infection of the graft can occur at the time of implantation, as hematologic seeding of the graft material, or via extension of a contiguous infection.  Staphylococcal species are most frequently identified as the causative agent. 
Graft infection can occur in either open repair or when using an endovascular approach with an overall incidence of approximately 0.3%. The time of onset of graft infection is variable, with open repair having an average onset of infection of 3 y or longer, whereas endovascular repair graft infections may occur earlier. Specific known risk factors include the presence of a femoral graft component, need for surgical revision, or an emergency indication for repair at the time of the initial procedure. 
Patients may present with low-grade fever, sepsis, groin drainage, pseudoaneurysm formation, or ill-defined abdominal or back pain. 
CT angiography of the aorta may be helpful to diagnose an infected graft with evidence of fluid collection, gas, pseudoaneurysm formation, or contiguous sources of infection.  CT imaging is also helpful for preoperative planning to determine the extent of graft revision that will be required. 
The treatment for graft infection is the surgical excision of all infected graft material with reconstruction. 
To reduce the risk of graft infection, the Society for Vascular Surgery strongly recommends antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with both open or endovascular repair of AAA undergoing dental procedures including manipulation of the gingiva, manipulation of the periapical area, or when perforation of the oral mucosa occurs. A weak recommendation exists for antibiotic prophylaxis for any procedures involving the respiratory, GI, or genitourinary tract as well as any dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures if there is a risk for infection or the patient is immunocompromised. 
Limb occlusion:
For patients presenting with ischemic symptoms, consideration should be given to thrombosis of the graft leading to impaired arterial supply.
Specific risk factors that increase the likelihood of limb occlusion include female sex and grafts that extend into the femoral artery. 
Endovascular AAA repairs possess an increased risk of limb occlusion compared with open repair. A small fraction (4%) of endovascular repairs are complicated by limb occlusion, typically within 2 months of AAA repair. 
Limb occlusion can be identified via U/S and/or CT angiography and is treated with thrombectomy, thrombolytics, or bypass of the occluded vessel. 
Para-anastomotic aneurysm formation:
Para-anastomotic aneurysm formation encompasses both the concept of pseudoaneurysm formation associated with a leak at the anastomosis of the native aorta and the graft material, as well as true aneurysm formation of native vascular tissue either proximal or distal to the graft. 
Best practices for the management of para-anastomotic aneurysms are unclear at this time. Revision is likely indicated for extremely large para-anastomotic aneurysms or aneurysms exhibiting a rapid change in size. Endovascular management strategies may come with reduced morbidity and mortality compared with revision of a previous open AAA repair. 
Endoleak:
Endoleak only occurs with endovascular repair of AAA. By definition, it is the presence of continued blood flow into an aneurysmal sac following endovascular repair. Some endoleaks require immediate revision of the endovascular repair whereas others resolve on their own and require surveillance alone. 
Endoleaks are classified by their location, which dictates management: 
Type IA is defined as filling of the aneurysmal sac secondary to an incomplete seal at the proximal portion of the endovascular repair. Given ongoing filling of the aneurysmal sac, this type of endoleak remains at risk of leading to aneurysmal rupture. Ideally, they are repaired at the time of endovascular aortic repair, given the significant risk of rupture.
Type IB is defined as filling of the aneurysmal sac secondary to an incomplete seal at the anastomosis of the stent graft and the iliac artery.
Type II is defined as filling of the aneurysmal sac from patent lumbar arteries or the inferior mesenteric artery. This is the most common type of endoleak, occurring in as many as 25% of patients undergoing endovascular repair. Type II endoleaks are typically observed because the risk of rupture is significantly less than that of a Type I endoleak.
Type III is defined as filling of the aneurysmal sac from an incomplete seal between graft components, separation of graft components, or erosion of the graft material. All type III endoleaks require revision to avoid aneurysmal rupture.
Type IV is defined as filling of the aneurysmal sac from blood traversing the porous fibers of an endovascular stent graft. Type IV endoleaks resolve spontaneously and do not require any treatment.
Device migration:
Limited to patients undergoing endovascular AAA repair, a stent graft can migrate, leading to a delayed Type IA or IB endoleak. Migration typically occurs 2 y or more after repair and requires revision of the original endovascular repair to avoid aneurysmal rupture. 
AAA postoperative surveillance:
Following open surgical repair of AAA, CT surveillance of the aorta is indicated at 5-y intervals. 
Following endovascular repair of AAA, CT surveillance of the aorta is typically indicated at 1 mo post-op and then annually, indefinitely. To reduce radiation exposure, U/S exams can be substituted; however, if there are any new findings on U/S, prompt CT imaging should be obtained. If U/S exams are used, CT surveillance every 5 y is recommended. 
Prevention of AAA
Smoking, including quantity and duration, are associated with increased risk of AAA. Exercise and consumption of nuts and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk of AAA. 
Smoking cessation may reduce AAA growth rate by 20%. 
There is currently insufficient evidence to routinely recommend the initiation of β-blockade, antihypertensives, or statins to reduce the risk of AAA expansion or rupture. 
The 2014 recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force for AAA screening in the asymptomatic patient are as follows: 
1-time screening U/S should be offered to all men aged 65 to 75 y who have ever smoked (Grade B Recommendation).
1-time screening U/S should be selectively offered to all men aged 65 to 75 y who have never smoked (Grade C Recommendation). Specific risk factors to consider include a first-degree relative with AAA, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hyperchloremia, obesity, or hypertension.
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend routine 1-time screening U/S in women aged 65 to 75 y who have a history of smoking.
Screening U/S is not currently recommended in women aged 65 to 75 y who have never smoked (Grade D Recommendation).
The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends ongoing U/S surveillance of an asymptomatic AAA at 3-y intervals for aneurysms measuring 3.0 to 3.9 cm, 12-mo intervals for aneurysms measuring 4.0 to 4.9 cm, and 6-mo intervals for aneurysms measuring 5.0 to 5.4 cm in diameter. 
There is high-quality evidence for the operative repair of the asymptomatic fusiform AAA when the abdominal aorta measures 5.5 cm or larger in diameter. However, females with aneurysms measuring 5.0 to 5.4 cm or rapid expansion (1 cm/y) may benefit from earlier repair. ",Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Key Concepts
Audio review of the OMI Manifesto EM:RAP Audio
The spectrum of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) currently includes unstable angina (UA), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), STEMI, and in the most severe presentation, sudden cardiac death.
See Algorithm or an appropriate ACS algorithm, which represents guideline-recommended management strategies combined with expert opinion.
“Time is muscle”: This common saying underscores the maximum benefit of early intervention in cases of acute coronary occlusion, with the benefit diminishing rapidly with the passage of time (in the order of hours).
The ECG is the most important initial test in the work-up of ACS, with the goal of identifying patients who would benefit from immediate reperfusion.
The ECG should ideally be recorded within 10 min of arrival to the ED when ACS is a consideration.
A prehospital 12-lead ECG should be reviewed and documented in every patient with symptoms compatible with ACS.
All systems should have prehospital catheter lab activation to facilitate optimal door-to-balloon times.
This target may be accomplished using the automated ECG interpretation algorithm, paramedic training, or ECG transmission to a base station.
In patients with ongoing symptoms that are highly suspicious of ACS but have a non-diagnostic initial ECG, either repeat ECGs should be obtained every 15-30 min for the first hour at minimum, or continuous 12-lead ST segment monitoring should be implemented.
The ECG undergoes a predictable pattern of changes during occlusion and reperfusion, making this method both a better identifier of successful reperfusion and a better predictor of viable myocardium than the time since the onset of symptoms. Algorithm
Current practice and guidelines for ACS follow the STEMI vs. NSTEMI paradigm (2000-present). However, this community of medical experts is in the process of advocating for a paradigm change. In general, this chapter presents the current paradigm and guidelines first in each section, with author opinions that differ from this established paradigm denoted at the end of each section for clear delineation.
The current formal “STEMI ECG criteria” include a new ST elevation measured at the J-point relative to the PQ junction, in two contiguous leads with the following cutoffs:
V2-V3: ≥2 mm in men ≥40 y old; ≥2.5 mm in men <40 y old, or ≥1.5 mm in women regardless of age.
Other leads: ≥1 mm.
Troponin is an important part of the work-up in patients with ACS. However, the decision to perform immediate reperfusion should only involve troponin when ECG is not diagnostic and the symptoms persist.
Troponin elevation must be interpreted in the context of clinical presentation. Elevated troponin as high as 85% is found in conditions other than type 1 MI (including type 2 MI, non-MI acute myocardial injury, and chronic myocardial injury).
The current U.S. guidelines recommend emergency reperfusion therapy for STEMI, NSTEMI with electrical or hemodynamic instability, and ongoing ischemia despite maximum medical management (aspirin, anticoagulants/antithrombotics, and antiplatelet agent).
STEMI:
Immediate PCI is recommended if ischemic symptoms <12 h after onset, or 12-24 h if there is “ongoing ischemia.”
STEMI at a PCI facility:
STEMI diagnosis-to-balloon time should not exceed 60 min.
STEMI at a non-PCI facility:
STEMI diagnosis-to-balloon time (at another facility) should not exceed 90 min.
The first medical contact-to-balloon time in transfer patients should not exceed 90-120 min.
If the total time from the first medical contact to PCI is estimated to exceed 90-120 min, fibrinolytics are recommended for symptom duration <12 h or 12-24 h if “a large area of the myocardium is at risk or hemodynamic instability is present.”
Half-dose thrombolytics have been described successfully and without an increase in major bleeding; however, this protocol was not subjected to a randomized trial.
After thrombolytics, the patient should be transferred immediately to a PCI facility, if available and feasible.
PITFALLS
The traditional “STEMI criteria” are neither sensitive nor specific for the outcome that they are intended to identify (acute coronary occlusion, or occlusion MI).
25% of NSTEMI patients have fully occluded culprit lesions (occlusion MI), and NSTEMI patients with occlusion have short- and long-term mortalities that are twice as great.
ACS medical therapy guidelines include aspirin, an anticoagulant (eg, unfractionated heparin [UFH]), and a P2Y12 inhibitor (usually clopidogrel or ticagrelor) as per Cardiology discretion or institutional protocol, as well as other treatments such as nitroglycerin.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: Aged or elderly patient with acute-onset chest discomfort radiating to the left arm, shoulder, or jaw, with diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting, and shortness of breath, often in the context of exertion or stress.
Remember that ACS is notorious for atypical presentations, especially among key populations such as women, diabetics, and the elderly.
No single risk factor, symptom, sign, or physical exam feature in isolation has a high sensitivity or specificity for the diagnosis of ACS.
Concerning features and findings with significant positive likelihood ratios (LR+) for the diagnosis of ACS include:
Prior known coronary artery disease (CAD) (2.0)
A change in the pattern of symptoms over the previous 24 h (2.0)
Pain similar to prior ischemia (2.2)
Pain radiating to both arms (2.6)
History of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (2.7)
Abnormal previous recent stress test (3.1)
High risk overall of clinical gestalt (4.0)
High-risk HEART score 7-10 (13.0)
Unstable angina:
Defined as ACS that does not have 1) at least one troponin greater than the 99th percentile and 2) an increase and/or decrease in troponin (defined for each assay).
Is characterized clinically by angina that is new in onset, occurs at rest, occurs with minimal exertion, or is otherwise worsening from a previously stable pattern.
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is defined by international consensus in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction and requires both:
The detection of an increase and/or decrease of cTn values with at least 1 value greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
Clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia.
Treatment
Emergency Reperfusion (PCI, Thrombolytics)
Call Interventional Cardiology for emergency reperfusion therapy recommended by ACC/AHA guidelines for:
STEMI:
Immediate PCI recommended for ischemic symptoms <12 h after onset, or 12-24 h if there is “ongoing ischemia” (12-48 h according to ESC guidelines).
We recommend that transient STEMI (STEMI in which all STE and symptoms have resolved) be treated with emergency PCI but not with thrombolytics. If PCI is not available, treatment should be with antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents, and immediate transfer to a PCI-capable institution should be secured.
NSTEMI with electrical/hemodynamic instability (acute pulmonary edema, shock, recurrent/refractory ventricular dysrhythmias, etc.).
NSTEMI with ischemia (chest pain or ECG ischemia) refractory to maximum medical management.
Ongoing ischemic chest pain
Refractory ischemic ECG findings
“STEMI equivalents” (currently only one per ACC/AHA: Left Bundle Branch Block + original Sgarbossa criteria).
Also consider emergency PCI for NSTEMI with ECG features of occlusion MI (OMI):
See Miranda et al. for the most thorough and up-to-date work on the ECG in ACS in the ED.  (Popup)
Thrombolytics for STEMI
Recommended if:
It will be >90-120 min total time from the first medical contact to PCI, or >90 min from STEMI diagnosis to PCI, and
Symptoms <12 h, or between 12-24 h if “a large area of the myocardium is at risk or hemodynamic instability is present”, or ECG shows high “acuteness” (large upright T waves, persistent R waves, persistent ST elevation).

≤67 kg: Infuse 15 mg IV over 1-2 min; then, 0.75 mg/kg (max 50 mg) over 30 min; then, 0.5 mg/kg (max 35 mg) over 60 min
Post-thrombolytic care:
Transfer to a PCI-capable facility should be carried out after the administration of thrombolytics.
Immediate PCI is indicated if there is no ECG evidence of reperfusion after thrombolytics (“rescue PCI”).
ECG evidence of reperfusion is at least a 70% reduction in ST segments.
After thrombolytics, at the receiving institution:
Routine immediate angiography +/- PCI in high-risk patients
Extensive ST elevation, new LBBB, previous MI, Killip class ≥2, LVEF <35%
Routine angiography +/- PCI for all others within 24 h
Medical Therapy for ACS
Other than aspirin and nitroglycerin, all additional medical therapy is best chosen prospectively in accordance with the interdisciplinary institutional protocol.
“Maximum medical management” of ACS = aspirin + anticoagulant + P2Y12 inhibitor (as per Cardiology discretion/institutional protocol) + IV nitroglycerine as tolerated +/- adjuncts such as glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors, as indicated.
Ischemia refractory to maximum medical management requires emergency angiography as per ACC/AHA guidelines.
Antiplatelet:
Aspirin: 162-325 mg PO (non-enteric-coated, chewable)
P2Y12 inhibitor:
Typically not given “upstream” (in the ED) unless by an interventionalist or as per the interdisciplinary protocol
STEMI with primary PCI: Clopidogrel 600 mg or ticagrelor 180 mg PO
STEMI with thrombolytics: Clopidogrel 300 mg PO
GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor:
In general, only given at the discretion of interventionalist, rarely “upstream” (in the ED).
Possible in patients who are at a high risk of CABG and cannot get P2Y12 inhibitor.
Anticoagulant:
STEMI or other critically ill ACS patient with primary PCI:
UFH: 60-70 units/kg (max 4,000-5,000 units) IVP loading dose, then 12-15 units/kg/h (max 1,000 units/h) infusion
Other agents (enoxaparin, bivalirudin) substituted as per Cardiology:
Enoxaparin: 0.5 mg/kg IV
Bivalirudin: 0.75 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by an IV infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/h for as long as 4 h post-procedure
STEMI with thrombolytics:
Enoxaparin is superior, but other agents (ie, UFH) are acceptable as per Cardiology/protocol:
Enoxaparin:
<75 y old: 30 mg IV bolus, then by 1 mg/kg SC (max 100 mg for the first dose) in 15 min
≥75 y old: No bolus, 0.75 mg/kg SC (max 75 mg for the first dose)
For creatinine clearance <30, give 1 mg/kg q24h (not 12 h)
Continue throughout hospitalization
UA/NSTEMI, not going immediately to the catheterization lab
Enoxaparin is superior, but other agents (UFH, bivalirudin, fondaparinux) are acceptable as per Cardiology/protocol.
Other adjuncts
Oxygen:
Supplemental oxygen should be administered if the patient is hypoxemic or showing signs of respiratory distress or hypoxemia.
Giving routine oxygen to non-hypoxemic patients has no benefit, and some studies have actually shown harm, including a larger infarct size and other secondary outcomes such as recurrent infarction and dysrhythmias with hyperoxia.
Metoprolol:
Consider for hypertension exacerbating supply/demand mismatch.
Avoid in tachycardia (a sign of poor stroke volume) or poor left ventricular (LV) function on bedside echo.
Metoprolol 50 mg PO, then 5 mg IV q5min ×3.
Improved survival in anterior STEMI with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) >120 and in the absence of tachycardia or AV block.
Nitroglycerin:
Consider for pulmonary edema, hypertension, or refractory chest pain.
Administer as IV or SL, not transdermal.
Do not give nitroglycerin to patients receiving tPA (nitroglycerin increases the metabolism of tPA and decreases the levels of tPA and thus its efficacy).
Opioid analgesics
Inconclusive data exist regarding whether opioids may be harmful in ACS.
We believe that the harm is likely due to the masking of ongoing ischemic symptoms without addressing the underlying ischemic pathology. This may lead to fewer serial ECGs and less frequent clinical reassessment, possibly leading to delays with respect to definitive management.
See the Deep Dive regarding the literature in the opioids section.
Our opinion is that opioids should be reserved for patients who are committed to immediate reperfusion therapy, to reduce ischemic pain during the time between the decision to perform definitive reperfusion and actual reperfusion.
Disposition
Patients judged to benefit from immediate reperfusion should be taken promptly to the cardiac catheterization lab for angiography and subsequently admitted.
All other patients with ACS should be admitted to Cardiology with the timing and benefit of angiography vs. non-invasive therapy to be determined by the Cardiology team.
Most patients with non-occlusive MI (NOMI) will undergo angiography +/- PCI during their hospital stay. Those with contraindications, who are at very low risk, have no recurrent ischemia, and have negative risk stratification testing (eg, stress test) may be treated non-invasively (medically) by the cardiologist or hospitalist, depending on the institution’s protocols.
The approach to low-risk patients without confirmed ACS and with undifferentiated chest pain is described in a separate chapter (See Chapter: Low Risk Chest Pain and Accelerated Diagnostic Protocols). In general, patients with symptoms that are compatible with ACS who have been judged by clinical Gestalt and/or risk stratification tools to be at an extremely low risk of ACS or other adverse events (<1%-2%) may be discharged with close outpatient follow-up in accordance with current ACEP Clinical Policy.
Charting Pearls
The timing of symptoms, treatments, ECG findings, and catheter lab activation/consultation are critical elements of documentation in this time-sensitive condition.
Describe whether ECG findings are new or old as compared with a baseline ECG, if available, or new/progressive based on serial repeat ECGs.
Ensure all relevant ECGs are incorporated into the medical records.
The documentation for patients who are not immediately sent to the catheter lab should reflect the presence or absence of ongoing ischemia despite medical therapy (which would require emergency reperfusion).",Acute Coronary Syndromes
"Deep Dive
Preface
As of 2019, we, the clinicians authoring this reference text, believe that the management of acute coronary syndromes is at a crossroads. The current practice and guidelines for ACS follows the STEMI vs. NSTEMI paradigm. However, it is our perspective that this paradigm is suboptimal and should be replaced with a paradigm with a higher accuracy for acute coronary occlusion and manages ACS in a similar manner to other critical arterial occlusion syndromes, such as acute stroke or acute limb ischemia.
Accordingly, we have the difficult task of presenting a fair and succinct overview of the management of ACS in such a way that the reader can emerge with the necessary skills to operate within the current standard of care while simultaneously understanding that there is room for improvement from that standard. For learners, this requires careful understanding regarding which elements below are supported by the current paradigm and guidelines and which are our opinions based on the newly suggested paradigm that we present, regardless of how well these perspectives may be supported by evidence and experience.
In general, in this reference text, we first present the current paradigm and guidelines in each section, followed by any of our opinions that differ significantly from the current paradigm. This format should allow the reader to clearly delineate between the current standard of care and the future that we hope to bring to patients, in part, with the help of reaching out to the medical community through this work.
Background
Overview
ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary diseases involving atherosclerotic plaque rupture and platelet-rich thrombus formation, causing stenosis or occlusion of the coronary artery with acutely diminished blood flow and resulting in hypoperfusion and ischemia, with or without infarction of the myocardium.
Myocardial infarct size ranges from microscopic to massive, depending on the myocardial territory that is at risk, collateral circulation, degree of coronary obstruction, showering of downstream platelet-fibrin aggregates into smaller vessels, and myocardial oxygen demand, which is dependent on the heart rate and wall stress.
The symptoms of ACS range from asymptomatic to sudden death.
ACS is the acute manifestation of CAD and ischemic heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and a significant fraction of the developed world, accounting for ⅓ of all deaths in individuals >35 y old. 
Chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms compatible with potential ACS comprise an enormous amount of ED visits.
Missed ACS remains one of the most common and costly etiologies of ED litigation. 
Mechanisms of Plaque Rupture and ACS
Coronary plaque ranges from a hard calcified plaque to a plaque with a soft inner core. 
The most vulnerable plaques have a soft lipid-rich acellular core with a thin fibrous cap. 
The largest component of a given plaque is extraluminal and not seen on standard angiography, which is only a “lumenogram,” whereas some plaques are entirely extraluminal.
Extraluminal plaques may be seen on CT coronary angiography, intravascular U/S (IVUS), or autopsy. 
Plaque rupture leads to exposure of the subendothelium, which leads to platelet activation and thrombus formation.
A lesion with severe (>50%) stenosis is more likely to rupture than a lesion with moderate stenosis, but the majority of plaque rupture ACS events that are seen clinically occur in lesions with <50% stenosis (moderate) due to the very high prevalence of moderate lesions as compared with severe lesions in the overall population.
Culprits often lie proximal to the site of maximum stenosis.
Endogenous tissue plasminogen activator and other processes may spontaneously lyse a thrombus.
ACS is therefore a very dynamic process, with the thrombus alternating between propagation and lysis.
ECG often records this dynamic process, with ST segments rising and falling.
Thus, often, an “autolysis” or “spontaneous reperfusion” occurs, and the angiogram may be non-diagnostic in such cases.
In one large study in STEMI patients, 15% had no culprit lesion on angiography, and 24% of these (3.6% of total) were thought to be STEMI without a culprit. 
IVUS may find a ruptured plaque that is not seen on angiogram.
Clinical Spectrum and Definitions of ACS
The spectrum of ACS currently includes unstable angina (UA), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and in the most severe presentation, sudden cardiac death.
Acute MI
AMI is defined by international consensus in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction  as requiring both of the following elements:
Detection of a rise and/or fall in cTn values, with at least 1 value greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
Rise and/or fall is not clearly defined.
A rise and/or fall of 20%-30% is often used, but:
The time between measurements is not standardized.
Absolute numbers are generally more accurate. 
Each assay and time period has its own appropriate absolute change, as determined in numerous observational studies. 
Clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, including at least one of the following:
Symptoms of myocardial ischemia
New ischemic ECG changes
Development of pathological Q waves
Imaging evidence of a new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology
Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for type 2 or 3 MI)
The Fourth Universal Definition of MI classifies AMI into 5 subtypes based on the mechanism and clinical circumstances, with only types 1-3 being relevant to emergency medicine practice. The classification is given as:
Type 1: AMI caused by atherothrombotic CAD and usually precipitated by atherosclerotic plaque disruption (rupture or erosion)
Type 2: AMI (but not ACS) caused by ischemic myocardial injury in the context of a mismatch between the oxygen supply and demand without acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption
Type 3: Patients who suffer cardiac death, with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia accompanied by presumed new ischemic ECG changes or ventricular fibrillation, and who die before blood samples for biomarkers can be obtained or before increases in cardiac biomarkers can be identified, or in whom MI is detected by autopsy exam
Type 4: AMI within 48 h and related to coronary intervention, including complications such as coronary dissection, downstream embolization, side branch occlusion, etc., (types 4A), and in-stent restenosis (type 4B)
Type 5: AMI within 48 h and related to coronary artery bypass graft surgery
STEMI vs. NSTEMI
According to the current paradigm, all patients with AMI are classified by the presence or absence of “STEMI criteria” on ECG, resulting in the categories known as STEMI and NSTEMI.
The definition of STEMI criteria varies according to different documents and guidelines, although almost all versions currently agree with the Fourth Universal Definition regarding the following criteria for the diagnosis of anterior, lateral, and/or inferior STEMI on the standard 12-lead ECG: 
“New ST elevation at the J-point in 2 contiguous leads with the cut-off point:
≥1 mm in all leads other than leads V2-V3, where the following cut-off points apply:
≥2 mm in men ≥40 y old
≥2.5 mm in men <40 y old
≥1.5 mm in women regardless of age.”
While there is agreement that the J-point should be the site of measurement of the ST segment, there has been debate regarding the appropriate definition of the baseline against which the J-point is measured. In fact, as of 2018, the Fourth Universal Definition has specified the first-ever baseline for all STEMI guidelines:
“In patients with a stable baseline, the TP segment (isoelectric interval) is a more accurate method to assess the magnitude of ST-segment shift, and in distinguishing pericarditis from acute myocardial ischemia. Tachycardia and baseline shift are common in the acute setting and can make this determination difficult. Therefore, QRS onset is recommended as the reference point for J-point determination.” 
The criteria specify that ST elevation is measured at the J-point, relative to the QRS onset (or “PQ junction”), which was the method used by Macfarlane to create the guidelines. 
The criteria were developed by Macfarlane et al.  according to the Common Standards for Quantitative Electrocardiography and the Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram  although they are not specified in the Fourth Universal Definition of MI. 
STEMI equivalents
This commonly used term generally refers to a patient with suspected ACS who has ECG findings that do not meet STEMI criteria but are prospectively believed to confer benefit from emergency reperfusion similar to a true positive STEMI.
At present, the ACC/AHA technically only recognizes one situation as a “STEMI equivalent”: Positive original Sgarbossa criteria in the setting of LBBB.
However, a wide variety of beliefs exist among different providers, specialties, and guidelines regarding other conditions that constitute a STEMI equivalent (eg, posterior STEMI, hyperacute T waves, de Winter’s T waves, modified Sgarbossa criteria, ST elevation in lead aVR associated with widespread ST depression, etc.).
Unstable angina
UA is a notoriously confusing and shifting concept but is currently diagnosed “when there are new or worsening symptoms of ischemia (or a changing symptom pattern) with or without ischemic ECG changes...but with normal biomarkers.” 
More broadly, UA is defined as ACS that does not have at least one troponin above the 99th percentile.
UA is characterized as angina that is any of the following: New in onset, occurs at rest, occurs with minimal exertion, or is otherwise worsening from a previously stable pattern.
Like MI, UA does not necessarily manifest as any ECG abnormalities.
UA is frequently referred to as crescendo angina or preinfarction angina, differentiating its acuity from stable angina and highlighting its short-term risk of AMI in the classic, severe cases.
To date, changes in high sensitivity troponin below the 99% reference value have not been established as a factor for ruling in or out UA.
Patients with chronic myocardial injury (chronically elevated troponins largely due to renal failure and heart failure) are the only UA patients who may have elevated troponins, although in these cases, the troponin elevation is not acute (flat with serial measurement) and is not a result of ACS. 
OMI vs. NOMI
Occlusion MI (OMI) is a type 1 ACS resulting in total occlusion or near-occlusion of the infarct-related epicardial vessel, with insufficient collateral circulation, such that full-thickness infarction will occur unless flow is restored immediately.
Non-occlusion MI (NOMI) is any MI (of any classification, types 1-5) that does not satisfy the description of OMI above.
Algorithm and Algorithm below for the differences in the categorization of ACS between the STEMI/NSTEMI and OMI/NOMI paradigms.
Epidemiology of ACS
In the discussion of AMI presented here, any reference to AMI is specifically to type I AMI (due to ACS), unless otherwise specified.
On initial ECG, STEMI criteria are 6.4% sensitive for any AMI, 35% sensitive for retrospectively adjudicated STEMI, and 21% sensitive for OMI.
On serial ECGs, STEMI criteria are 9.4%, 51%, and 30% sensitive, respectively.
Blinded cardiologist visual ECG interpretation is 17%, 82%, and 30% sensitive, respectively.
Earlier data that were methodologically inferior showed that approximately 28%-30% of all AMI cases manifest as STEMI criteria on ECG, while the remainder are NSTEMI by definition. 
Essentially, all true positive STEMI cases have near or total occlusion with insufficient collateral circulation (OMI) vs. at least 25%-30% of NSTEMI cases. 
Assuming that 30% of all AMI is STEMI(+) OMI, then approximately 18% of AMI is STEMI(-) OMI, while the remaining 52% is non-STEMI NOMI.
Thus, slightly less than ½ of all AMI cases are caused by occlusion MI.
MIs of both type 1 and 2 may present with or without STEMI criteria depending on the degree and extent of ischemia, although fewer than 5% of type 2 MI cases exhibit ischemic ST elevation. 
Mortality of ACS
The mortality rates of UA, NSTEMI, and STEMI depend heavily on:
The year in which the event values were measured (decreasing mortality rates have been recorded in all categories over the past 20 y). 
Whether the events were observed in randomized controlled clinical trials vs. observational studies (patients who are well enough to enroll in RCTs typically have significantly lower mortality). 
Whether the NSTEMI groups include type 2 NSTEMIs (in which there is no ACS, and mortality is dependent on the underlying cause and medical or surgical illness).
With that significant qualification, we believe that the data presented by Rogers et al.  using the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction provide a reasonably robust estimate of general mortality:
The in-hospital mortality for cases of STEMI and NSTEMI were reported as 8.0% and 5.2%, respectively.
Other studies have reported in-hospital or 30-d mortality rates in the STEMI group of 9%-12%,  whereas some RCTs enrolling less sick STEMI patients show in-hospital mortality rates as low as 5.8%. 
A large and robust STEMI treatment program reported 6.3% 30-d and 10.3% 1-y mortality rates for STEMI patients. 
The reported mortality of NSTEMI varies widely between studies, with values as great as 45% at 3.2 y,  likely because 33% of NSTEMIs in these studies were classified as type 2 MI, which includes a heterogeneous mixture of patients with serious non-cardiac illness.
For example: An elderly patient with recurrent stroke, peripheral vascular disease, multivessel CABG, and end-stage heart failure who has an NSTEMI due to type 2 MI in the setting of any reason for hospitalization will obviously have higher mortality than the 45-y-old previously healthy patient suffering from non-occlusive type 1 MI, regardless of ECG findings or the extent of the ACS.
Thus, the mortality rates of “NSTEMI” in the literature may be significantly more dependent on the patient’s baseline health rather than their ACS and its underlying cause.
Sandoval et al. provide a rare glimpse of the difference in mortality between type 1 and type 2 NSTEMI, with 180-d mortality rates of 8% and 13%, respectively, vs. 11% for those with elevated troponins who did not meet clinical criteria for AMI (acute myocardial injury not due to MI). 
The mortality of NSTEMI is greater than that of STEMI at 1 y. 
Some authors prefer to reserve the term “NSTEMI” for type 1 MI only. For instance, MI caused by demand ischemia would not be referred to as “NSTEMI” but rather “type 2 MI,” since NSTEMI implies type 1 ACS. 
The short-term mortality rates of UA are less well studied, although small available studies report 1%-3% in-hospital mortality. 
The mortality of NSTEMIs with vs. without occlusion MI Table:
NSTEMIs with acute coronary occlusion [STEMI(-) OMIs] have roughly double the short- and long-term mortality of NSTEMIs without acute coronary occlusion [STEMI(-) NOMIs], despite the fact that individuals with STEMI(-) OMI are younger and have fewer comorbidities than those with STEMI(-) NOMI. 
Coronary Anatomy and Correlation to Electro- and Echocardiography
Understanding the anatomy that underlies ACS helps the provider to identify and confirm ACS with the help of the electro- and echocardiography.
The ECG location of infarction correlates with myocardial territory, which correlates slightly more loosely with coronary anatomy (since there is significant patient-to-patient variation in coronary artery anatomy).
In general, the two main arteries from the aorta are the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left main coronary artery (LM) Figure.
The RCA typically supplies the right ventricle (RV), inferior wall of the left ventricle (LV), the atrioventricular (AV) and sinoatrial (SA) nodes, and may also supply some or most of the posterior, and even lateral, walls of the LV.
Important branches of the RCA include the right ventricular marginal branch, which supplies the RV, and the posterior descending artery, which supplies the posterolateral branches in the 85% of the population who have a “right-dominant system.”
The LM typically divides into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX).
However, the ramus intermedius (RI) is a common variant artery between (“intermediate” to) the LAD and LCX that occurs when the LM trifurcates (LAD, LCX, and RI) rather than bifurcates (LAD, LCX).
Often, when there is an RI, the first diagonal is small or less significant, and the RI takes its place.
The major branches off the LAD are called diagonals (eg, D1, D2, etc.), while those off the LCX are called obtuse marginals (eg, OM1, OM2, etc.).
The anterior aspect of the septum is supplied via the septal “perforators,” and the anterior wall is generally supplied by the LAD, diagonals, and obtuse marginals, while the lateral and high lateral walls may be supplied by any combination of the diagonals, obtuse marginals, and the LCX.
The apex of the heart is generally supplied by the LAD, and the LAD may extend even further in the case of a “type 3” “wraparound LAD,” which describes the LAD wrapping around the apex and supplying the apex and inferior wall.
In those with left-dominant circulation, the LCX supplies the PDA and thus the inferior wall.
Regardless of dominance, the posterior wall may be supplied by almost any combination of RCA and LCX via posterolateral branches off the RCA or off the LCX and its OMs, and even via diagonals.
It should be noted that many purists object to the term “posterior” as a location due mostly to articles by Bayes de Luna that correlate tall right precordial T waves with a lateral location. These articles do not indicate that electrocardiographic posterior STEMI should be abandoned. 
Finally, it is important to reiterate that the RCA typically supplies the nodes (AV and SA nodes), while the LAD supplies the bundle branches (right and left bundle branches, including the anterior and posterior fascicles).
On standard 12-lead ECG, the approximate correlations between the leads and the main walls of the myocardium are:
Anterior (V2-V4)
Lateral and “high” lateral (V5-V6, I, and aVL)
Inferior (II, III, aVF)
See image Figure
Extra posterior leads V7-V9 overlie the posterior wall, while the extra right-sided leads V3R-V6R overlie the RV.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation of ACS
33% of both STEMI and NSTEMI, and as many as 75% of patients >75 y old, present without any chest pain whatsoever,  and >40% of women with AMI have no chest pain. 
The prototypical clinical presentation of ACS includes chest pain or discomfort, although there is a significant range of anginal equivalent or associated symptoms including shortness of breath, epigastric or abdominal pain, back pain, shoulder or arm pain, nausea, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, fatigue, syncope, weakness, lethargy, etc.
The associated pain or discomfort may radiate to the arms, back, abdomen, neck, or jaw.
Atypical presentations are common among women, diabetics, and the elderly.
The spectrum of severity ranges from silent MI,  which is recognized only later,  to vague complaints in a well-appearing patient, to those with electrical or hemodynamic instability or frank cardiac arrest.
The risk factors for CAD are commonly elicited during evaluation for possible ACS, including a prior history of CAD, diabetes, tobacco use, cerebrovascular disease, PVD, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, a family history of CAD before 55 y old, HIV/AIDS, and autoimmune disorders.
Unfortunately, multiple systematic reviews have confirmed the poor accuracy of any single risk factor, symptom, or sign for the diagnosis of ACS. 
The most useful risk factors in the acute setting are:
PAD (LR+ 2.7)
Abnormal previous stress test (LR+ 3.1)
Established history of CAD (LR+ 2.0)
Although there is significant variability among authors, the most useful symptoms in the acute setting include: 
Pain radiating to bilateral arms (LR+ 2.6)
Pain similar to prior ischemia (LR+ 2.2)
A change in the pattern of chest pain over the most recent 24 h (LR+ 2.0)
All of the following patient descriptions of chest discomfort are associated with the same incidence of AMI: Burning, pressure squeezing, indigestion, crushing, tightness, numbness, and nondescript chest discomfort. 
Only “stabbing” is associated with a lower probability. 
Conversely, helpful historical features that decrease the likelihood of ACS are pain that is:
Fully reproducible by palpation (LR+ 0.28) 
Fully pleuritic or fully positional 
The response to nitroglycerin (both improvement and lack of improvement) was unhelpful with LRs approaching 1.0. 
Physician Gestalt (blinded to everything except the initial history and physical) showed the following categories and LRs for the likelihood of ACS: 
“Definite” (4.0)
“Probable” (1.8)
“Could be” (0.66)
“Probably not” (0.20)
“Definitely not” (0.36)
The HEART score (which does not utilize advanced ECG interpretation) was quite useful for the diagnosis of ACS, with LRs of 13 for the high-risk (7-10 points) and 0.20 for the low-risk (0-3 points) categories.
Vital signs are generally not helpful in the diagnosis of ACS, with the exception of tachycardia.
In sinus rhythm with a normal ejection fraction and without significant pain and/or anxiety on clinical exam, there is no pathophysiologic reason to expect tachycardia.
While Fanaroff did not find any use to the presence or absence of tachycardia for the diagnosis of ACS,  Lee et al. found an LR- of 0.43 for a heart rate (HR) >99 bpm for the diagnosis of type 1 MI among chest pain patients who had an ejection fraction >50% on U/S, and even better performance among patients with a HR >120 bpm.  Patients with ACS and poor LV function may indeed have tachycardia.
Summary of the features that increase the probability of ACS:
Radiation to the shoulder, jaw, or arms (bilateral > right >> left)
Exertional chest pain
Diaphoresis
Vomiting
Same as the symptoms of proven cardiac ischemia
Substernal or left-sided, poorly localized discomfort
Not reproduced by palpation, position/movement, or deep breath
Risk factors
Older age
Summary of the features that decrease the probability of ACS:
Right-side-only discomfort
Discomfort primarily in the mid to lower abdomen
Pain is localized to a fingertip area
Symptoms that last for only sec
Although the patient reports a discomfort, it improves with exertion (“it goes away when I play basketball”)
Chest wall palpation precisely reproduces the discomfort on multiple exams
Pain is completely pleuritic
Pain is initiated only by changes in position or by movement
Constant pain lasting many hours but without ECG or troponin changes
Stabbing pain, like a knife
Fewer risk factors
Younger age
Clear non-ischemic etiology: eg, chest wall trauma
Pitfalls
Nitroglycerin cannot be used as a diagnostic test for ruling in or out ACS. 
Antacids cannot be used as a diagnostic test for ruling in or out ACS. Antacids may be associated with pain relief in as many as 25% of AMI cases.
A normal ECG does not rule out ACS.
Be wary of diagnosing chest pain as having a gastrointestinal (GI) etiology. Cardiac ischemia can produce symptoms that mimic GI pathology, and vice versa.
Electrocardiography in ACS
ECG is the most useful, most rapidly available, and most important initial test in the work-up of potential ACS.
In this setting, the chief role of ECG is to identify patients with acute coronary occlusion who would benefit from immediate reperfusion, since this is a time-sensitive decision that carries the greatest mortality benefit of all interventions in ACS (other than, perhaps, the administration of aspirin).
After this initial consideration, ECG is also used to help diagnose non-occlusive ACS, to help differentiate ACS from other pathologies, and to aid risk stratification for future ACS events in patients who do not currently have evidence of active ACS.
Descriptions of STEMI vs. NSTEMI:
The current guideline-endorsed approach to the ECG identification of OMI is the STEMI criteria above.
As explained above, the STEMI criteria are insufficiently sensitive and specific for OMI.
Furthermore, there is poor inter-observer (and even intra-observer) agreement regarding the methods of measurement and the actual measurements of the ST segment itself, even when using the same standard. 
Under the current paradigm, McCabe’s survey demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 79%, respectively, in a group of attending physicians whose specialty and level of experience varied slightly. 
The inter-rater reliability (Kappa) was only 0.33.
Among interventionists reading ECGs and deciding which patient should be sent to the catheter lab, Tran showed similar poor results: 
Sensitivity (53%-83%, mean 71%)
Specificity (32%-66%, mean 63%)
Consistency (among all of the interventionists, the number of cases recommended for immediate PCI ranged from 32%-86%)
Advanced ECG Interpretation:
Expert ECG interpretation for the identification of OMI is a complex and important skill that is beyond the scope of this article and has been well-reviewed in a recent publication by Miranda. 
The progression of ECG findings in OMI, and in reperfusion, is critical to the appropriate management of ACS Algorithm Algorithm.
The earlier in the OMI progression sequence that the diagnosis is made, the greater the benefit of reperfusion.
The earliest ECG sign of occlusion is QT lengthening. 
The subsequent finding after acute occlusion is increased area under the T wave (hyperacute T wave), which signals a viable but ischemic myocardium.
Then, as the ischemia progresses, the ST segment begins to elevate.
As the amount of viable myocardium diminishes with infarction (irreversible cell death or myocardial stunning), the ST segment begins to fall.
As the myocardium irreversibly infarcts, Q waves form.
The absence of an action potential in the myocardium underlying the lead is overwhelmed by the action potential of the opposite wall, which has a vector away from the lead, and therefore its deflection is negative (a Q wave).
Q waves may also form in salvageable myocardium.
This is especially true in anterior MI, where Q waves may form early and are reversible with early reperfusion. 
The prototypical evolution is from hyperacute T wave to STE to T wave inversion to Q wave, and depends on the myocardium at risk, the location of the myocardium relative to the leads, the collateral circulation, the completeness and timing of reperfusion, and the presence of no-reflow (when downstream perfusion is still blocked at the level of the microvasculature despite successful intervention on the epicardial vessel during PCI).
Although variations of this process can occur, all ECG ischemia evolves over time.
Any ECG finding that does not evolve was not due to ischemia.
If myocardial ischemia was present, but the ECG did not evolve, then the ischemia was silent on the initial ECG.
If the ECG does evolve from the initial ECG, then the initial ECG probably manifested that ischemia, whether recognized or not.
ECG pseudoinfarction patterns may be proven non-ischemic by the absence of evolution.
In actual clinical practice, the occluded artery may undergo reperfusion and reocclusion at any point in the occlusion or reperfusion sequence below.
Thus, the skilled electrocardiographer can infer from an ECG when the infarct-related artery is reperfusing or re-occluding in real time, with greater accuracy than observing the patient’s symptoms, which do not always correlate with ECG findings of transmural ischemia, even the obvious findings. 
Example Clinical Case
ECG

A male in his early 40s with known CAD (but no prior PCI or CABG) presented with episodic chest and lower abdominal pain, complaining of an episode of pain that resolved immediately before EMS arrived. In the ED, he was asymptomatic at the time of ECG 1, which does not show signs of ischemia.
The patient remained pain-free in the ED. Initial troponin was undetectable. Given his known CAD, he was admitted for further high-risk ACS evaluation. That evening at 10:30 pm, the chest pain returned. ECG 2 was recorded at that time, showing new development of hyperacute T waves in leads V2-V4, as well as I and aVL, with reciprocal depression in the inferior leads, and all without meeting STEMI criteria. These ECG findings were not recognized at that time.
Troponin from 10:30 pm returned undetectable. At 11:00 pm, the pain was still present, so another ECG (ECG 3) was recorded. This ECG shows the further development of diagnostic hyperacute T waves in the same leads, still without meeting STEMI criteria, and these findings were not recognized at that time. The patient was given IV morphine.
At 4:20 am, ECG 4 was recorded, which shows interval development of clear STE meeting STEMI criteria, which finally triggered activation of the cath lab.
He was found to have a 100% (TIMI 0) occlusion of the proximal LAD which was stented with excellent angiographic result.
Later that morning after the intervention, ECG 5 was recorded which shows resolution of most of the STE, but with new Q waves in leads I and aVL suggesting full thickness infarction or at least stunning. The leads with prior STE now have the beginnings of terminal T wave inversion, signifying the reperfusion of some viable tissue.
On repeat ECG 1 month later (ECG 6), we see the expected findings of a large, completed anterior infarct (Q waves or minimal R waves, persistent terminal or full T wave inversion). Assuming the same lead placement, it appears that the R waves in leads I and aVL have recovered somewhat.
Radiographic Evaluation
Chest radiograph
A CXR is commonly ordered in all patients with potential ACS symptoms, typically with the intent of ruling out other conditions or diagnosing concomitant conditions.
There are no particular findings of ACS on the CXR; however, ACS resulting in cardiogenic shock may generate pulmonary edema and/or pleural effusions.
The CXR may reveal other conditions such as pneumothorax, CHF, pneumonia, etc.
Echocardiography
The role of echocardiography in the setting of ACS includes the detection of wall motion abnormalities and the differentiation of ACS from other diagnoses and/or late ACS complications, such as papillary muscle rupture, free wall rupture with tamponade, etc.EM:RAP Video

Wall motion abnormalities may be correlated anatomically with non-diagnostic findings on ECG, thereby increasing the certainty of focal transmural ischemia.
Some institutions use an “intermediate” ACS activation protocol in which an emergency bubble contrast-enhanced formal echocardiogram is used to aid the decision whether to proceed immediately to the catheter lab based on the presence or absence of a wall motion abnormality.
While the presence of a wall motion abnormality may help to increase the suspicion of ACS, its absence should not necessarily be reassuring unless the echocardiogram is truly of perfect quality, performed with contrast, and read by a skilled echocardiographer.
If such a high-quality echocardiogram shows no wall motion abnormality, it is highly unlikely that an epicardial coronary artery is occluded, unless there is good collateral circulation to that area of the myocardium.
It is also important to remember that the wall motion abnormality may be transiently present, corresponding with the dynamic nature of coronary occlusion and reperfusion. After reperfusion, the wall motion abnormality may remain for hours to days to weeks (myocardial stunning), or it may resolve rapidly if the ischemia intensity and duration are minimal.
Laboratory Evaluation
Cardiac troponin is the primary biomarker ordered to check for ACS and is used to define MI.
There are very few indications for CK-MB, which has fallen out of favor due to the superiority of troponin. However, CK-MB can be used to assess for re-infarction within the first few days of initial infarction when the troponin is still elevated.
Troponin is generally measured immediately on arrival and at serial intervals (eg, every 3 h) thereafter to evaluate for its rise and/or fall.
There are many different troponin assays in use; therefore, the clinician must understand several key concepts of troponin assays:
Troponin T vs. troponin I.
Level of detection is the lowest value that can be consistently detected by the assay.
99th percentile reference means that 99% of “normals” (variously defined, but generally very healthy individuals) have levels equal to or below this value.
Coefficient of variation describes the precision with which the assay measures the same sample on two separate occasions and should typically <10%, or possibly <20%, at the 99th percentile reference level.
“High-sensitivity” troponins are defined by the fact that >50% of normals (the population that is less than the 99th percentile reference range) have a measurable level with a good coefficient of variation.
Troponin is a very sensitive marker of myocardial injury and is elevated in many disease states in addition to ACS.
As many as 85% of positive troponins are not due to ACS.
Among 1,640 ED patients who had troponins and ECG obtained, 30% had at least one elevated troponin (>99% reference range), 4.7% had type 1 MI, 8.5% had type 2 MI, and 17% had elevated troponin without meeting the definition of MI. 
Elevated troponin of any etiology, regardless of the presence of ACS, is associated with higher mortality than in its absence.

Risk Stratification Scores in ACS
TIMI score
The TIMI score is a 0-7 point scale designed to calculate the risk of composite outcome (death, MI, or recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization) at 14 d in confirmed ACS patients.
Derivation and internal validation:  The derivation was performed using a database of 7,081 UA/NSTEMI patients from the TIMI 11B and ESSENCE trials.
All patients had at least one of the following: Known CAD, ischemic ECG, and/or positive troponin.
Excluded patients received a catheter within 24 h.
External validations:
See: Scirica et al.,  Pollack et al.,  and Chase et al. 
Limitations:
Does not consider the amount of troponin elevation, vital signs, shock, prior cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction, or any other ECG findings other than “ST changes” ≥0.5 mm.

GRACE (Global registry of acute coronary events) score
This is a continuous-scale score from 0-300 designed to predict in-hospital to 6-mo mortality in the setting of confirmed ACS.
The GRACE score was initially derived and validated from 17,000 patients in 94 hospitals. 
Inclusion. Signs or symptoms of acute cardiac ischemia and one of the following:
ECG findings consistent with ACS
Cardiac biomarker serial increases consistent with ACS
Documented CAD
Derivation: Fox et al. 
Validation: Elbarouni et al. 
Multiple studies have confirmed that immediate PCI is superior to delayed PCI for UA/NSTEMI if the patient has a GRACE score ≥140 (which correlates with an in-hospital risk >3%).
From Mehta et al.: 
NSTEMI patients without refractory ischemia were randomized to “early” (median 14 h) vs. “delayed” (median 50 h) catheter.
Significant reduction in the primary outcome (composite of death, MI, or stroke) was found in the group with GRACE scores >140 (13.9% vs. 21.0%, P = .006, Number Needed to Treat (NNT )= 14).
From Kofoed et al.: 
Among patients with a GRACE risk score >140 (approximately 50% of the cohort), a very early invasive treatment strategy (median 4.7 h) improved the primary outcome (combination of all-cause death, non-fatal recurrent MI, hospital admission for refractory myocardial ischemia or HF) as compared with the standard invasive treatment (median 62 h), with a hazard ratio of 0.81; 95% CI of 0.67-1.01; and a P value for interaction of .023 (raw numbers are not available in the manuscript).

Clinical Assessment of the Timing of MI
Symptom-based timing assessment
The underlying assumption behind all of the timing recommendations above is that the time since the onset of symptoms is the best way to judge whether there is infarcted (irreversible) vs. ischemic (salvageable) myocardium.
The problems with patient-reported time since onset:
Acute coronary occlusion is a dynamic process, often involving periods of reperfusion and reocclusion.
This approach does not take into account the roles of collateral circulation and ischemic preconditioning.
As a result, patients may describe 24 h of pain, but upon further questioning, it is revealed that the pain has come off and on, with symptoms recurring and persisting only a few hours prior to presentation.
Conversely, a myocardium that is fully salvageable may be reported as having constant pain for days.
This is analogous to current endovascular stroke treatments, in which the timing window is overruled by imaging evidence of salvageable brain tissue with a small core infarct.
ECG-based timing assessment
A high acuity on ECG is a significantly better indicator of a salvageable myocardium than the pain duration.
ECG indicators of acuity in general include:
The absence of Q waves
High ST segments
Large/hyperacute T waves
The absence of T-wave inversion
Anderson-Wilkins acuity score
High acuity according to the Anderson-Wilkins acuity score is demonstrated by tall T waves, whereas lower acuity is indicated by Q waves or T-wave inversion. 
This score correlates with salvageable myocardium better than the duration of symptoms based on ECG criteria  and myocardial perfusion imaging. 
Hyperacute/tall T waves
“Tall” T waves are an independent marker of benefit from thrombolytics, such that STEMI patients with tall T waves had a lower 30-d mortality than patients who did not receive thrombolytics (5.2% vs. 8.6%, P = .001), and were less likely to develop HF (15% vs. 24%, P < .001) and cardiogenic shock (6.1% vs. 8.6%, P = .023). 
The mortality after thrombolytics in patients with positive T waves is the same for those who have >2 vs. <2 h of symptoms. 
These data, combined with common sense and the ECG progression of OMI (above), leads to the logical conclusion that the benefit would be even greater in the presence of hyperacute T waves before the stage of ST segment elevation, when the ratio of salvageable to infarcted myocardium is maximum, although this has never been studied.
Unfortunately, hyperacute T waves have never been formally defined.
Q-waves
Although Q waves may be indicative of lower acuity, it is important to note that QR waves are present in 50% of anterior MI within the first hour of symptom onset, representing ischemia of the conduction system rather than completed infarction. 
Patients with pathologic Q waves already present within the first hour have a larger final infarct size but benefit equally from thrombolytic therapy.
Armstrong et al.  more recently showed that Q waves on the “baseline” ECG (first ECG recorded during the event) were an independent marker of a worse outcome, and “after multivariable adjustment, baseline Q-wave but not time from symptom onset was significantly associated with a 78% relative increase in the hazard of 90-d mortality and a 90% relative increase in the hazard of death, shock, and CHF.”
Therefore, QR waves alone should never be used as a reason to withhold immediate reperfusion therapy.
Despite our knowledge of the ECG characteristics of acuity, no randomized thrombolytic trials have been carried out based on these characteristics.
ECG evidence of reperfusion
After reperfusion therapy, ECG is also the most accurate test to determine whether the downstream myocardium has reperfused spontaneously or as a result of therapies.
As expected based on baseline knowledge of the ECG progression of OMI (diagram above), the ECG findings of reperfusion include:
The resolution of hyperacute T waves and ST segment elevation.
The progression of terminal, then full, T-wave inversion over the course of hours to days.
The current ACC/AHA guidelines suggest using improvement in chest pain, the resolution of ST segment elevation (>70%), and the presence of reperfusion arrhythmias (accelerated idioventricular rhythm ECG), although the guidelines admit that these indicators are imprecise.
The resolution of chest pain is an unreliable indicator of reperfusion and re-occlusion.
Timing of Reperfusion in Symptomatic ACS Patients
Like the indication for immediate reperfusion, the timing of reperfusion therapy has also been incompletely studied but, overall, can be summarized by the classic saying “time is muscle.”
Boersma et al.  provide the most complete meta-analysis examining the efficacy of thrombolytics as a function of time since the onset of pain Table.
The benefit of thrombolytics is proven to extend out to at least 12 h from the onset of symptoms and is uncertain from 12-24 h, which explains the current ACC/AHA recommendations that thrombolytics should be used if the time delay to catheter is >90-120 min from the time of the first medical contact to the balloon time, or >90 min door-to-balloon time (class 1A, up to 12 h; class IIC, from 12-24 h with “ongoing ischemia” and “a large area of the myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability”).
The benefits of PCI are clearly more favorable, leading the ACC/AHA to extend the recommendation for primary PCI out to 12-24 h (48 h for ESC) if any evidence of ongoing ischemia is present, and “irrespective of time delay from MI onset” if there is cardiogenic shock or acute severe HF Table.
Rathore: 
43,801 patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.
Results:
Median door-to-balloon time of 83 min, with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 4.6%.
Multivariate logistic regression showed that longer door-to-balloon times were associated with a higher adjusted in-mortality risk (P < .001):
30 min = 3.0%
60 min = 3.5%
90 min = 4.3%
120 min = 5.6%
150 min = 7.0%
180 min = 8.4%
Conclusion: The door-to-balloon time should be as short as possible, with benefits accruing even at times <60-90 min.
Systems approaches to reducing the door-to-balloon time
Bradley et al.  studied 365 PCI centers, comparing their door-to-balloon times and surveying 28 specific strategies.
Six strategies were significantly associated with faster door-to-balloon times (the mean reduction is in parentheses):
Emergency physician catheter lab activation (in contrast to cardiology) (8.2 min)
Single call to the central operator for activation (13.8 min)
Emergency physician catheter lab activation while the patient is en route to the hospital (ie, prehospital activation) (15.4 min)
Policy expecting catheter lab staff to arrive in the catheter lab within 20 min after being paged (19.3 min)
Policy mandating that an interventionist always be on site (14.6 min)
“Real-time data feedback” for ED and Cardiology staff (8.6 min)
Based on the above data and the recommendations of the authors of this reference, we advise that each of the elements below be explored via local capabilities to reduce the door-to-balloon time:
Prehospital triage system
Prehospital activation, achieved by either:
The transmission of ECG for review by the ED/Cardiology
Paramedic catheter lab activation
Plan for back-up thrombolytics
Prehospital transport to a PCI-capable hospital
Emergency physician activation of the catheter lab (if not carried out prehospital)
QA real-time data feedback, hospital-based Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)
A single call to the central operator and time-based expectation of staff arrival
Timing of Reperfusion in Asymptomatic ACS Patients
Resolved symptoms with persistent ECG findings
Occasionally, patients may present with persistent ST elevation (or other ischemic findings) but resolved chest pain.
This is surprisingly common, and several studies of continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring in the setting of admitted unstable angina report high rates (15%) of silent transient myocardial ischemia (ST elevation). These findings were strong, independent predictors of MI or death during hospitalization. 
After a careful interrogation ensuring that the patient is truly symptom-free and has not received any pain-reducing non-ACS therapy (opioids) that may be obscuring the identification of ongoing ischemia without actually addressing the underlying ACS, the provider is left with the question of whether to treat the patient immediately, as if symptoms were persistent.
One would reason that ECG evidence of ongoing ischemia means that the suspected occlusion is still causing ongoing infarction, and therefore, there should still be benefit to emergency therapy.
Evidence: 
The authors randomized 347 patients, with at least one 20-min episode of chest pain 12-48 h before presentation with no persistent symptoms but unequivocal ST elevation on the ECG, to either receive an immediate angiogram with PCI or a later invasive evaluation only if they developed recurrent angina or other worsening features.
Most importantly, the study design highlights the fact that persistent symptoms would have clearly indicated immediate PCI.
The patients who received immediate PCI had a significantly smaller median LV infarct size (8% vs. 13%, P = .001) as measured by a single-photon emission CT, as well as a non-significant but underpowered decrease in the composite of death, recurrent MI, or stroke at 30 d (4.4% vs. 6.6%, P = .37).
There is no other available evidence in patients whose symptoms have resolved but whose unequivocal ECG findings persist.
Thus, the available evidence supports the common sense theory that even asymptomatic patients with persistent ECG evidence of full-thickness infarction (OMI) should receive an immediate angiogram and PCI.
Resolved symptoms and resolved ECG findings (“transient STEMI”)
The decision is more difficult in patients whose symptoms and ECG findings have both resolved completely.
On one hand, this type of patient is clearly demonstrating an unstable thrombus that has the potential to re-occlude at any moment (and which may be silent when it does)  and lead to disastrous consequences that may deteriorate before the patient can be rushed to the catheter lab.
On the other hand, it could be argued that the patient will most likely be safe if receiving aggressive ACS therapy and extremely close continuous 12-lead monitoring or at least serial ECGs being read by an expert in the signs of re-occlusion, and that very few patients will deteriorate between immediate recognition and timely PCI, such that the burden of activating the catheter lab overnight may be somehow comparable with the risk of patient harm.
Evidence: 
The authors randomized 142 patients with transient STEMI (whose symptoms and ST elevation had resolved) to an emergency vs. next-day angiogram and PCI, with all patients receiving aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and an anticoagulant.
While the infarct size based on MRI was the same in both groups, “4 patients (5.6%) in the delayed invasive strategy required urgent intervention due to signs and symptoms of reinfarction while awaiting angiography.”
Each patient who suffers re-occlusion while awaiting delayed catheter, runs the risk of lack of identification of re-occlusion, worsened MI due to the added ischemic time as a result of the delay, and a small but real risk of true deterioration and death between the identification of re-occlusion and PCI.
These authors compared the emergency angiography results of 18 prehospital patients with transient STEMI to 75 patients with sustained STEMI.
Significant lesions (≥50%) were found in 94% and 97% of patients (P = .6), and subtotal or total lesions (≥95%) were found in 63% and 85% (P = .1), respectively.
Thus, even those with the full resolution of symptoms and ST elevation had 63% incidence of total/subtotal occlusion.
No other clinical outcomes were reported.
The authors studied 1,244 consecutive STEMI patients and found 63 (5%) with transient STEMI.
These patients were treated aggressively with IV nitroglycerin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin.
In comparison with sustained STEMI, transient STEMI was associated with less myocardial damage, less extensive CAD, higher TIMI flow grade, and better cardiac function.
The study compared transient STEMI to sustained STEMI and found that transient STEMI was correlated with lower mortality, lower myocardial damage by troponin, and better cardiac function.
These results are not surprising, since reperfusion by any means (including spontaneous reperfusion) leads to a better prognosis. However, the results of this study do not answer the question of whether the majority of unaffected patients outweighs the rare disastrous outcome that will inevitably occur if all transient STEMIs are treated in a delayed fashion.
Author recommendations:
In our clinical experience and interpretation of the literature, patients with transient ST elevation should be sent to the catheter lab immediately, just as if they had not experienced a resolution of ST elevation.
If, for some reason, the angiogram is delayed, such patients should receive the maximum medical therapy in an ICU setting with continuous 12-lead ST segment monitoring under the close attention of a practitioner with advanced ECG interpretation training.
The same reasoning applies to patients with unequivocal ECG evidence of reperfusion from OMI (Wellens syndrome, eg, the reperfusion of anterior OMI without a recorded ECG during occlusion).
Both groups of patients are at very high risk of re-occlusion, and re-occlusion may be clinically silent or too late to prevent myocardial loss or death.
Example clinical case: A 51-year-old male with no chest pain but acute left hand numbness while playing cards with friends. The catheter lab was activated based on the prehospital ECG [STEMI(+) OMI], then deactivated based on the ECG at ED arrival showing relative reperfusion [STEMI(-) OMI], then reactivated again based on the repeat ECG 15 min later [STEMI(+) OMI]. The patient expired on arrival to the catheter lab before intervention. There was a 15-min delay by deactivation due to transient/reperfusing STEMI(+) OMI. ECG
Therapeutic Considerations
General Treatment
Goal: To achieve and maintain rapid reperfusion and to stabilize the ruptured atherosclerotic plaque/thrombus, thereby restoring blood flow to the myocardium and limiting the infarct size and complications.
Universal initial actions
Establish IV access, perform a 12-lead ECG, and initiate cardiac monitoring.
Oxygen
Supplemental oxygen should be administered if the patient is hypoxemic (oxygen saturation <90%) or showing signs of respiratory distress or hypoxemia. 
Giving routine oxygen to non-hypoxemic patients has been shown to have no benefit,  and some studies have even shown harm, including a larger infarct size and other secondary outcomes such as recurrent infarction and dysrhythmias. 
Aspirin
A non-enteric-coated PO loading dose (162-325 mg) should be given to all ACS patients without contraindication. 
The benefit of aspirin vs. placebo in the setting of suspected STEMI has been quantitated in ISIS2, in which aspirin displayed an NNT of 42 for mortality. 
Nitroglycerin
SL nitroglycerin (0.4 mg q5min, up to 3 doses as the blood pressure allows), followed by a nitroglycerin drip starting at 10-50 µg/min for active chest pain, followed by a nitroglycerin drip for ongoing symptoms (class I, level B), but is contraindicated in patients with hypotension, suspected inferior and/or RV MI, or recent phosphodiesterase inhibitor use (within 24-48 h). 
Indicated for ACS with ongoing chest pain, hypertension, or concomitant HF with pulmonary edema. 
There is no evidence base for nitroglycerin in STEMI in the reperfusion era, with the exception of modest benefits in the reperfusion era trials ISIS-4  and GISSI-3. 
Other recommendations are extrapolated from older, pre-reperfusion era studies using IV or long-acting nitrates for 24-48 h in the setting of AMI, in the absence of PCI and angiography, with varying co-administered antithrombotic therapies, which showed modest symptom and mortality benefits in the nitroglycerin groups. 
IV nitroglycerin can decrease the plasma concentration and thrombolytic effect of tPA, thus IV NTG should not be administered with tPA. 
Opioid analgesics
Although opioid analgesics have potential mechanisms by which they may improve the supply/demand mismatch (decreased sympathetic output due to pain relief, causing decreased myocardial demand, etc.), they primarily reduce pain without addressing the underlying thrombus.
Opioids in the setting of unrecognized OMI may mask the symptoms of ongoing ischemia, resulting in false reassurance of the provider and reduced likelihood of serial ECGs, troponins, and re-evaluation.
Guideline recommendations for opioids in ACS:
The 2013 STEMI guidelines recommend opioid analgesics such as morphine or fentanyl in patients with STEMI. 
The 2014 NSTEMI guidelines state that “IV morphine sulfate may be reasonable for continued ischemic chest pain despite maximally tolerated anti-ischemic medications” (class IIb, LOE B). 
Primary evidence of opioids in ACS:
To date, no high-quality evidence has confirmed the possible harm of opioids in ACS. However, several retrospective analyses have shown an association between opioids and increased mortality.
Meine et al.  examined the massive CRUSADE registry of high-risk NSTEMI/UA patients (requiring ischemic ST depression, positive biomarkers, or transient ST elevation) and found that morphine was associated with increased overall mortality (odds ratio = 1.48 [1.33-1.64]) after propensity score matching, among all examined subgroups.
Conversely, Puymirat et al.  examined a registry of STEMI patients and found no difference in in-hospital mortality, possibly in accordance with our suggestion that no harm is done in OMI patients who are already receiving immediate reperfusion treatment.
Other arguments against the use of opioids in ACS feature pharmacodynamic data showing that opioids delay the GI uptake and anti-platelet effect of ticagrelor. However, these results have never been demonstrated to translate to patient-centered outcomes. 
Author recommendations:
Thus, the authors of this reference text believe that opioid medications should be administered with severe caution in the setting of possible or confirmed ACS unless the decision to proceed to immediate reperfusion therapy has already been made, lest these medications obscure the interpretation of ongoing ischemia despite maximum medical management that mandates emergency reperfusion.
That is, the use of opioid analgesics implies commitment to full, immediate treatment including a prompt angiogram, since opioids obscure the determination of ongoing pain (requiring immediate angiography).
If the decision to proceed with immediate reperfusion therapy has already been made, then opioids may be administered to alleviate symptoms during the time between evaluation and definitive reperfusion.
Serial ECGs
Serial ECGs can be useful in any situation involving possible ACS, since dynamic changes affect treatment decisions. This method can be performed every few minutes in a critical patient or up to every few hours in an asymptomatic patient, with immediate repeats performed anytime the clinical status changes. 
Other treatments are based on the patient’s history, physical exam, and ECG classification based on our current guidelines.
Guideline-recommended ACS Treatment Algorithm (Current STEMI vs. NSTEMI Era)
See Algorithm for the ACS algorithm presented by the authors that combines guideline-approved practice from:
ACC/AHA STEMI  and NSTEMI  guidelines
ACEP NSTE-ACS Clinical Policy 
ACEP STEMI Clinical Policy 
European Society of Cardiology guidelines for STEMI 
European Society of Cardiology guidelines for NSTEMI 
STEMI guidelines
If the STEMI criteria are met, immediate PCI is recommended if available for patients with ischemic symptoms for <12 h in duration (class I, level A) and those with ongoing ischemia at 12-24 h after the onset of symptoms (class IIa, level B).
ESC recommends PCI up to 48 h. 
If there is a delay >90-120 min from the time of the first medical contact to primary PCI, or >90 min from door to PCI, fibrinolytics are recommended in patients with symptoms for <12 h in duration (class I, level A) or ongoing ischemia between 12-24 h from onset with a large area of the myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability (class IIa, level C).
Furthermore, the guidelines also suggest that thrombolytics are “not harmful” and, therefore, may be beneficial for patients in whom “true posterior (inferobasal) MI is suspected or when associated with ST elevation in lead aVR,” although no specific ECG criteria are given for these conditions.
In both cases, patients with STEMI presenting to a non-PCI-capable hospital should be transferred to a PCI-capable hospital as soon as possible.
Adjunctive medications are to be given as soon as possible in the case of PCI or fibrinolytics including loading doses of aspirin (162-325 mg non-enteric-coated chewable aspirin), a P2Y12 inhibitor (usually clopidogrel 600 mg or ticagrelor 180 mg PO), and an anticoagulant (UFH most commonly, 70-100 U/kg with a max loading dose of 4,000 U IV push).
See ECG Intermittent ST elevation ECG
NSTEMI/UA guidelines
Emergency reperfusion: If the STEMI criteria are not met, the current guidelines still recommend emergency reperfusion in several situations.
Left bundle branch block (LBBB):
The ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines recommend that LBBB (regardless of chronicity) with positive original Sgarbossa criteria be considered a “STEMI equivalent,” requiring emergency reperfusion. 
Ischemia with instability or ischemia refractory to medical therapy:
The ACC/AHA NSTEMI guidelines recommend immediate PCI for NSTEMI patients with active ACS and hemodynamic or electrical instability, as well as those with “refractory angina” (angina that is refractory to maximum medical management including aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and anticoagulation).
Medical management: NSTEMI or UA patients who have active, ongoing ACS at the time of evaluation (any evidence of ischemia including clinical angina, ECG evidence of ischemia, etc.) but do not immediately meet any criteria for emergency catheterization should immediately be started on “maximum medical management,” including aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and anticoagulation (UFH or low-molecular weight heparin) as per ACC/AHA guidelines.
However, the ACEP NSTE-ACS Clinical Policy gives a level-C recommendation that “P2Y12 inhibitors and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be given in the ED or delayed until cardiac catheterization.” 
After the rapid administration of maximum medical management, the patient is re-evaluated to determine whether the angina/ischemia is refractory, in which case the patient would qualify for emergency catheterization (but not fibrinolytics).
Thrombolytics are indicated in a limited group of NSTEMI patients: 
The 2013 guidelines imply that if there is widespread ST depression with STE in aVR (which is due to subendocardial ischemia), the depression is refractory to medical management, and mechanical reperfusion (PCI) is unavailable, then thrombolytics are acceptable in spite of the decades-old prohibition against thrombolytics for ischemic ST depression.
The authors of this reference text agree with this perspective, as indicated in the studies from which the prohibition originated: 
Patients who have as little as 1 mm STD
Patients who have STD in only 1 lead
Small numbers of patients
Mostly patients with >6 h of symptoms
If angina or other signs of ischemia have completely resolved, the patient may be risk-stratified and dispositioned as usual.
Patients who require treatment for active ischemia in the ED are usually not suitable for immediate provocative testing or coronary CT angiogram in the ED, regardless of their risk scores when asymptomatic, and should be admitted to Cardiology.
Patients without STEMI who present with prior symptoms suggestive of ACS but no active symptoms or signs of ischemia during evaluation should be given aspirin, placed on a cardiac monitor, serial ECGs ordered, and risk-stratified as per current practice.
Thrombolytic Therapy for Acute MI
All thrombolytic therapies for ACS should be decided in a protocolized, multi-disciplinary fashion. The following is meant to aid such protocol developments.
Background
Mechanism: Fibrinolytic (also known as thrombolytic) agents are thought to enzymatically lyse the fibrin-rich thrombus formed at the time of plaque rupture in ACS, ideally resulting in improved clinical outcomes via reperfusion of the affected artery and downstream ischemic myocardium. 
FTT meta-analysis:
The mortality benefit of thrombolytics in suspected AMI was unequivocally proven by multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) during the “reperfusion era” of the 1980s-1990s, culminating in the Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists’ landmark meta-analysis of 58,600 patients in 9 RCTs of fibrinolytics vs. placebo in the setting of suspected acute MI. 
Heterogeneity among the 9 studies:
There was significant clinical heterogeneity among the 9 RCTs, including different thrombolytic agents, trial designs, co-administered medications, time windows for enrollment, and ECG criteria.
ECG criteria:
No ECG criteria were required for enrollment in ASSET, EMERAS, LATE, ISIS-2, or ISIS-3.
The remaining four trials required some sort of ST segment deviation for enrollment, although all four of these had differing criteria with regard to the presence or absence of ST depression, degree of ST elevation, method of measurement, and the number of leads required.
Despite clinical heterogeneity, almost all 9 studies found a mortality benefit to thrombolytics.
Results:
Entire cohort (before any subgroup analysis):
30-d mortality: 11.5% vs. 9.6% for the placebo vs. thrombolytic groups, with an absolute mortality benefit of 1.9% (NNT = 56 for mortality).
This benefit existed despite a clear mortality harm (NNH = 200) for the thrombolytic group in the first 24 h after randomization
Subgroup analysis: ST depression vs. elevation vs. normal:
Differing definitions and cut-offs between studies.
Those with “ST elevation” were found to have an even greater mortality benefit (NNT = 42) than the baseline population.
Those with “ST depression” and “normal” ECGs both experienced a non-significant mortality harm (NNH = 42 and NNH = 143, respectively).
ST depression was not scrutinized and was likely a heterogeneous mix of non-ischemic ST depression (eg, LVH) and ischemic ST depression.
Limitations:
No further ECG changes were studied, and none of these studies involved cardiac catheterization. Thus, we do not know the proportion of patients in each group who actually had acute coronary occlusion, nor the proportion of false positives (those who ultimately had no MI at all). These studies and their meta-analysis prove conclusively that ST elevation (although without a consensus definition) is the best way to determine which patients benefit from thrombolytics, assuming both of the following:
Cardiac catheterization is not available (therefore, the practitioner is unable to definitively determine which patients have the disease before applying treatment).
The practitioner is unable to predict the benefit of thrombolytics (therefore, the presence of an occlusive thrombus amenable to thrombolysis) more accurately than the subgroup analysis in the FTT meta-analysis (“normal,” “ST depression,” or “ST elevation”).
After the FTT meta-analysis, no further randomized controlled literature exists examining thrombolytics vs. placebo (nor PCI vs. placebo).
This meta-analysis and its surrounding literature lead to the transition from the Q wave vs. non-Q wave MI to the STEMI vs. NSTEMI paradigm, which officially began in 2000. 
No RCT has ever attempted to examine subgroups of the “normal” or “ST depression” populations to see which of these patients benefit from emergency reperfusion, despite the fact that many other ECG findings correlate with acute coronary occlusion and 25%-30% of NSTEMI is found to have acute coronary occlusion upon delayed catheterization.
Thus, the quantitated efficacy of thrombolytics for OMI, except for the subgroup of STEMI(+) OMI, is not known, and likely never will be.
See Figure for the mortality benefits/harms of thrombolytics in the FTT meta-analysis and comparison with the OMI/NOMI paradigm.

Thrombolytics vs. PCI
During the 1990s, multiple RCTs examined the difference between thrombolytics and primary angioplasty (PCI) in patients with STEMI (definition varied, almost always different from current-day criteria).
Almost all studies found short- and long-term benefits to PCI over thrombolytics, including:
Better angiographic outcomes and decreased rates of mortality 
Decreased recurrent MI 
Decreased intracranial bleeding 
Shortened hospital length-of-stay 
Decreased rates of reintervention  and readmission 
A review of 23 randomized trials demonstrated a significant reduction in death, MI, and stroke (8% vs. 14%, P < .001) in patients treated with primary PCI as compared with fibrinolytic therapy. 
Even in patients who require transfer, PCI is better than thrombolytics.
Dalby et al.  published a meta-analysis of trials in STEMI patients whose transfer time would be <3 h, which compared patients transferred for primary PCI with those treated with immediate fibrinolysis at the non-PCI hospital.
The authors demonstrated a similarly impressive reduction in death, MI, and stroke (7.8% vs. 13.5%, P < .001). 
The particular techniques involved in PCI and the various stents available are beyond the scope of this chapter but have also improved significantly over the past 25 years, as have all of the adjunct antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapies.
Combination Reperfusion Strategies (Thrombolytics + PCI)
Facilitated PCI (PCI facilitated with thrombolytics) for STEMI
According to a quantitative review of 17 heterogeneous trials, 9 with GPI pretreatment alone and 8 that used thrombolytics either alone or with a GPI, there is no proven beneficial role of upstream pretreatment with thrombolytics, and they may even be harmful. 
Facilitated PCI with fibrinolytic therapy had significantly higher rates of mortality, non-fatal reinfarction, urgent target-vessel revascularization, total and hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding as compared with primary PCI. There were no differences in efficacy or safety when facilitated PCI with (an upstream) GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor was compared with primary PCI.
ASSENT-4 PCI (ASSENT and investigators, Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Treatment Strategy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention): 
STEMI with anticipated delay to PCI of at least 1 h; median delay was 104 min.
½ dose reteplase + abciximab followed by PCI vs. abciximab alone followed by PCI vs. placebo + PCI, +/- GPI at the time of procedure.
All patients received aspirin and UFH.
The treatment groups could not use GPI.
The reteplase group with increased hospital death (6% vs. 3%):
Poor results were blamed on: 1) No heparin infusion after the bolus in the reteplase group; 2) no upfront loading of clopidogrel; and 3) no GPI.
FINESSE: 
Pretreatment with reteplase + abciximab, then PCI vs. pretreatment with abciximab vs. abciximab at the time of PCI.
All patients received aspirin and low-dose UFH or low-dose enoxaparin.
No P2Y12 inhibitor.
No difference in outcomes.
Again, as in ASSENT-4 PCI, there was likely insufficient anticoagulation and no P2Y12 inhibition.
It is known that patients who do not have reperfusion after thrombolytics require “rescue PCI” (see below). The above trials (ASSENT-4 PCI and FINESSE) may seem to imply that no patient should receive thrombolytics when a plan for transfer and subsequent PCI also exists, but this is not the appropriate conclusion. In both trials, the inadequate adjunct therapy probably resulted in poor results in the thrombolytic group. In addition, the longer the delay to PCI, the more important thrombolytics can be.
Below, the authors of this reference text present data that thrombolytics are indeed indicated if any significant delay to PCI is anticipated.
Rescue PCI (after the failure of thrombolytics) for STEMI
Class I and IIa recommendations are given in the 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines. 
Gershlik et al.  studied 427 patients with STEMI in whom reperfusion failed to occur (<50% ST segment resolution) within 90 min after thrombolytics.
Randomized to:
Repeated thrombolysis (142 patients)
Conservative treatment (141 patients)
Rescue PCI (144 patients)
Event-free for rescue PCI was 84.6% vs. 70.1% for conservative therapy and vs. 68.7% for repeated thrombolysis (overall P = .004).
Rescue PCI is indicated in patients who receive thrombolytics but do not have reperfusion based on the ECG criteria of ST resolution.
Other studies support this conclusion. 
Wijeysundera et al.  performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials of repeat fibrinolysis vs. angioplasty for failed thrombolysis. Accordingly, rescue PCI resulted in better outcomes; repeat thrombolysis did not.
Transfer for PCI-only vs. thrombolytics prior to transfer for STEMI
If the delay from the time of the first medical contact to PCI will be >90-120 min (which it commonly is):
Thrombolytics first, and transfer all patients.
On arrival to the PCI facility, high-risk patients or those without ECG evidence of reperfusion should undergo immediate PCI.
If the delay is <90-120 min, then transfer for PCI without thrombolytics.
Facilitated PCI (thrombolytics) with full adjunctive antithrombotic therapy & P2Y12 inhibition when the patient cannot obtain PCI within 1 h for STEMI
STREAM study.  Patients presenting to a non-PCI hospital were all transferred.
Randomized to:
1) TNK-tPA before transfer.
Standard-dose bolus TNK-tPA (½ dose in patients ≥75 y old) with clopidogrel 300 mg and enoxaparin (30 mg IV + 1 mg/kg SC) before transport to a PCI-capable hospital.
2) No TNK-tPA before transfer.
PCI-only group:
Patients in the PCI-only group were treated very fast, with a duration of 100 min from symptom onset to sheath insertion. 
Thrombolytic before PCI group:
Emergency coronary angiography was performed if fibrinolysis failed (this was measured based on the resolution of pain and ST segment elevation on the ECG).
Thus, this case is analogous to a planned rescue PCI (see Rescue PCI below).
Otherwise, angiography was performed 6-24 h after randomization.
The primary endpoint was a composite of death, shock, CHF, or reinfarction up to 30 d.
Results:
36% of lytic patients required urgent PCI. The mean time from randomization to angiography in these patients was 2.2 h, vs. 17 h for the other 64%.
The primary endpoint occurred in 116 of 939 patients (12.4%) in the fibrinolysis group with rescue and in 135 of 943 patients (14.3%) in the primary PCI group (P = .21).
Intracranial hemorrhage was 1.0% for TNK-tPA vs. 0.2%.
Conclusion: Transfer for PCI without thrombolytics is best if PCI at the receiving facility can be performed <90-120 min from the time of the first medical contact, or <90 min from the time of STEMI diagnosis in the first ED.
Thrombolytics prior to transfer to a PCI capable facility, then rescue PCI if no reperfusion for STEMI
The TRANSFER AMI study. 
High-risk STEMI: BP <100, HR >100, Killip class II and III, ST depression of at least 2 mm in precordial leads, ST elevation in right precordial leads (RVMI).
All patients received TNK-tPA.
80%-90% received clopidogrel 300 mg (75 mg in patients >75 y old).
Enoxaparin (not for patients >75 y old) or UFH (50-50). The doses were not specified (presumably standard doses).
Patients randomized to:
1) Standard Rx:
Transfer only if there is persistent ST elevation (<50% ST resolution).
No transfer if there is reperfusion (ST resolution).
2) Transfer with immediate PCI regardless of reperfusion.
Results: The intervention group had PCI for a median of 2.8 h after randomization.
30-d severe adverse outcomes were 17.2% vs. 11.0% (NNT = 16).
Conclusion: All high-risk STEMI cases should be immediately transferred after thrombolytics.
Thrombolytics prior to transfer to a PCI-capable facility, then routine PCI regardless of reperfusion for STEMI
CARESS-in-AMI: 
Patients: High-risk STEMI, had at least one high-risk feature treated initially at a non-PCI hospital
Extensive ST elevation, new LBBB, previous MI, Killip class ≥2, LVEF <35%
½ dose reteplase, abciximab, heparin, aspirin, only 1/6 received upstream clopidogrel, but this is probably not significant, since the patients did receive DAPT using abciximab
Randomized to:
Immediate transfer for PCI
Standard therapy: Transfer for rescue PCI only if needed
PCI in 85.6% of the immediate group; rescue PCI in 30.3% of the standard group
The median time from thrombolytics to transfer was 110 min in the immediate group vs. 180 min in the rescue group
Composite of all-cause mortality, reinfarction, and refractory myocardial ischemia within 30 d (4.4% vs. 10.7%, P = .004) in the immediate PCI group vs. standard care/rescue PCI group (NNT = 17)
No significant differences in major bleeding at 30 d (3.4% vs. 2.3%, P = .47) or stroke (0.7% vs. 1.3%, P = .50)
Meta-analysis including both high-risk and non-high-risk patients:
Concluded that all patients should be transferred for early routine PCI after thrombolytics. 
Early was defined as <24 h. However, the figure below from an editorial  representing the 7 trials in the meta-analysis shows that the time to PCI was usually very short.
Conclusions:
All high-risk patients who receive thrombolytics prior to transfer should have immediate angiography +/- PCI at the receiving facility regardless of reperfusion status (in other words, not only the patients who need rescue PCI).
Among the non-high-risk patients who do not require rescue PCI, also consider immediate angio +/- PCI after a delay of 2-3 h. 
Half-dose thrombolytics prior to transfer to a PCI-capable facility for STEMI
Half-dose thrombolytics prior to transfer appears to be an attractive option, without an increase in major bleeding. 
This study was not a randomized trial.
The institution was a STEMI receiving center, with some referral hospitals >60 miles away.
The study group was compared with STEMI patients presenting directly to the receiving hospital.
All patients received aspirin, clopidogrel, and unfractionated UFH.
Those presenting to hospitals ≥60 miles away also received ½-dose fibrinolytic with transfer for immediate PCI.
A total of 2,634 consecutive STEMI patients from all sources.
660 transferred from remote hospitals utilizing ½-dose TNK-tPA
600 patients presented directly to the PCI center
The door-to-balloon time for direct vs. transfer (mean +/- CI): 62 (44-83) vs. 122 (100-147)
No significant differences in 30-d mortality (5.5% vs. 5.6%; P = .94), stroke (1.1% vs. 1.3%; P = .66), major bleeding (1.5 vs. 1.8%; P = .65), or re-infarction/ischaemia (1.2% vs. 2.5%; P = .088) in patients receiving TNK vs. those presenting directly to the PCI center, despite a significantly longer door-to-balloon time
Summary: Combination reperfusion strategies (thrombolytics + PCI)
Firstly, it is important to realize that only a small percentage of STEMI patients who do not receive thrombolytics are actually transferred for PCI in a timely fashion, and thus thrombolytics prior to transfer should be strongly considered.
When the drive time is >30 min, only 42% of patients achieve a first door-to-balloon time <90-120 min. The recommended time for the first medical contact-to-balloon time is <90-120 min. 
Thus, according to the ACC/AHA, immediate transfer after thrombolytics is recommended:
For all failed reperfusions (for rescue PCI), ST resolution <70%
For all high-risk patients
For all other patients, it is reasonable to transfer:
For these patients, PCI should be delayed for 2-3 h after thrombolytics. 
Finally, ½-dose thrombolytics prior to transfer appears to be an attractive option, without an increase in major bleeding. 
Antiplatelet Therapy for ACS
All antiplatelet therapies for ACS should be decided in a protocolized, multi-disciplinary fashion. The following is meant to aid those protocol developments.
Aspirin
An aspirin (162-325 mg non-enteric-coated) loading dose should be given to all ACS patients (and all potential ACS patients) without contraindication. 
Do not give baby aspirin, enteric-coated, or >325 mg.
STEMI:
The benefit of aspirin vs. placebo in the setting of suspected STEMI has been quantitated in ISIS2, in which aspirin displayed an NNT of 42 for mortality. 
NSTEMI:
There is no difference between high-dose (eg, 325 mg qD) and low-dose (eg, 100 mg qD) aspirin. 
There is no clear aspirin vs. placebo literature for the NSTEMI group alone.
Unstable angina:
It remains unclear whether these patients would have been classified as NSTEMI or even STEMI today.
Death/MI: 10.1% vs. 5.0%, NNT = 20. 
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
There are two classes of dual antiplatelet therapy:
P2Y12 inhibitors (the most important):
This inhibitor blocks ADP production in platelets, one of the principal platelet activators.
Clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, cangrelor.
GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors:
This inhibitor blocks the final common pathway in platelet aggregation, the GP IIb-IIIa receptor, to which fibrin links, allowing cross-linkage with other platelets.
Tirofiban, eptifibatide, and abciximab.
All have bleeding risks.
Dual antiplatelet therapy in ACS is incredibly complicated.
Firstly, everyone with ACS should receive aspirin, as above, unless allergic.
All randomized trials administer aspirin to all patients.
“Dual antiplatelet therapy” (DAPT) generally refers to aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, but could also refer to aspirin + a GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor (GPI), if no P2Y12 inhibitor is given.
In some cases, all 3 (aspirin, P2Y12, and GPI) are administered.
There are 6 general classifications of patients. Within any one of these 6 classifications, the data are confusing. These classifications include:
STEMI (including OMI) requiring immediate primary PCI
STEMI treated with thrombolytics
STEMI with thrombolytics followed by PCI, after transfer to a PCI facility
NSTEMI with emergency (primary) PCI
OMI or NOMI
NSTEMI (OMI or NOMI) with delayed PCI
Within 24 h
>24 h
NSTEMI (OMI or NOMI) with medical therapy only
Many factors complicate the decision for each classification:
The different classifications of patients, as outlined above
P2Y12, or GP IIb-IIIa (GPI), or both
4 different P2Y12 inhibitors, 3 different GPI
Studied with various permutations of the 4 different anticoagulants
“Upstream” (pretreatment) in the ED or ambulance vs. only giving at the time of PCI
The many permutations of various syndromes, differences in the timing of intervention, various P2Y12 inhibitors, GPIs, anticoagulants, and upstream vs. downstream administration makes conclusions very difficult to develop. Hence, every institution has its own protocol
In general, among patients undergoing angiography/PCI, the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is more dependent on achieving adequate platelet inhibition by the time of intervention than on the diagnostic category.
It is essential to achieve maximum platelet inhibition at the time of PCI, since this is a highly thrombogenic procedure.
Therefore, the rapid onset of platelet inhibition with a P2Y12 inhibitor is especially important for immediate PCI.
Higher doses act more rapidly than lower dose; this is especially useful for clopidogrel: 600 mg achieves earlier platelet inhibition than 300 mg.
Higher doses also have more bleeding risk.
Ticagrelor is predictable and rapidly acting, especially if chewed.
Prasugrel achieves complete platelet inhibition sooner than clopidogrel.
However, upstream administration was associated with worse bleeding and equal ischemic outcomes in a randomized trial. 
Cangrelor is IV and has immediate onset, but can only be given at the time of PCI by the interventionist.
IV GPIs result in rapid platelet inhibition.
“Upstream” (pretreatment, in the ED or ambulance) administration of P2Y12 inhibitors and of GPI. 
Should DAPT be given in the ambulance or ED prior to the angiogram? Or should the practitioner wait until the angiogram “defines” the coronary anatomy and the choice of therapy (PCI, CABG, or neither)?
ACEP clinical guideline: “P2Y12 inhibitors and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be given in the ED or delayed until cardiac catheterization” (Level C recommendation). 
Only prasugrel (NSTEMI with PCI only) and ticagrelor (STEMI with PCI only) have been studied in dedicated trials comparing pretreatment vs. no pretreatment.
For patients who are sent immediately for an angiogram (eg, STEMI/OMI):
ATLANTIC trial: Ticagrelor
Prehospital (31 min earlier than the controls) treatment resulted in 5% more patients (47.5% vs. 42.5%) with ST resolution after PCI (P = .05), a secondary outcome. The outcomes of this trial were considered negative. 
For patients undergoing delayed angiogram/PCI (eg, for NSTEMI):
ACCOAST trial: Prasugrel
30 mg upstream followed by 30 mg at angiography as compared with 60 mg at angiography, had more bleeding with the same ischemic outcomes. 
The median was 19 h from symptom onset to angiography.
Unstudied problem: Patients who must wait over the weekend, up to 72 h, for an angiogram. Does upstream DAPT, along with anticoagulants, decrease preprocedure re-infarction?
Concurrent anticoagulant administration:
Studies differ in the anticoagulant used with the GPI or P2Y12 inhibitor.
Enoxaparin exhibits antiplatelet activity, since it inhibits the production of activated factor X (Xa), which means reduced thrombin production, and thrombin is a platelet activator.
Bivalirudin is not often used with a GPI but is always used with a P2Y12 inhibitor.
UFH has been used with every combination of antiplatelet therapy.
Individual P2Y12 inhibitors
The most important DAPT medications. These inhibitors must be given ASAP to achieve onset by the time of PCI (PCI results in heightened platelet reactivity).
Clopidogrel
Thienopyridine, a prodrug, requires conversion to its active metabolite form and, therefore, has unpredictable effects.
The onset of a 300 mg load is too slow.
A 600 mg load works significantly faster.
STEMI with PCI:
Double dose: 600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on days 2-7, and 75 mg qD thereafter. 
PCI-CLARITY at a 300 mg load. 
Decreased death/MI/stroke from 12.5% to 7.0%, NNT = 23
HORIZONS-AMI: 
600 mg vs. 300 mg non-randomized
4.9% vs. 8.2% (death, re-MI, stent thrombosis), NNT = 30
600 mg preferred (2009 STEMI update). 
Randomized: 
600 mg was found to be better than 300 mg
As measured by the infarct size, peak biomarkers, TIMI flow <3, LVEF, and 30 d major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE)
STEMI with thrombolytics:
COMMIT: 
45,800 with STEMI, 75 mg loading dose qD
Death/re-MI/stroke decreased from 10.1% to 9.2%, NNT = 11
CLARITY TIMI-28 at a 300 mg loading dose. 
Death/re-MI decreased from 21.7% to 15.0%, NNT = 16
UA/NSTEMI with PCI:
Double dose: 600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on days 2-7, and 75 mg qD thereafter 
PCI-CURE: 
300 mg load, then 75 mg qD
30-d death/MI/revasc.: 6.4% vs. 4.5%, NNT = 48.
Started 6 d before the procedure (which is a long wait for patients with UA/NSTEMI)
If the dose is 300 mg, it should be given significantly in advance of the procedure.
Clopidogrel 300 mg vs. placebo given at different times before the procedure.
CREDO: 300 mg administered >6 h before elective PCI, as compared with 0-6 h, reduced the composite of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization by 38.6% without a significant difference in bleeding. Clopidogrel was superior only if given at least 15-24 h before the procedure. 
48 h death/MI: 6.4% if given <15 h; 2.5% if given >15 h before the procedure. 
600 mg vs. 300 mg, randomized (12% vs. 5% favorable outcomes). 
600 mg vs. 300 mg, given 4-8 h before the procedure, results in significantly fewer adverse outcomes (12% vs. 4%). 
Only give before PCI with institutional approval due to CABG bleeding risk. CABG is required in up to 16% of NSTEMI cases. 
However, good evidence of safety and efficacy has been documented even in the CABG group:
ACUITY (non-randomized). 
Editorial 
1,539 of 13,800 had CABG, with a 5-d washout before CABG
A longer length of stay by 3 d was recorded
30-d death/MI/revasc.: 17.3% vs. 12.7%, favoring clopidogrel pretreatment
No CABG bleeding difference
UA/NSTEMI without PCI (medical therapy only):
ACS: CURE trial
300 mg, then 75 mg. 9.3% vs. 11.4% (death, MI, stroke), NNT = 48, across all TIMI scores 
Prasugrel
Thienopyridine, a prodrug that requires conversion to its active metabolite form, has a faster onset
Requires less transformation by CYP enzymes in the liver, is less subject to genetic polymorphisms, and is more likely to result in platelet inhibition
Only studied in patients with a plan for PCI (only give after angiography, not upstream, not in the ED)
Lower death/MI/non-fatal stroke rates (12.1% vs. 9.9%) reported than with clopidogrel (TRITON-TIMI-38) 
Both STEMI and NSTEMI
Increased major bleeding recorded (2.4% vs. 1.8%)
Not studied against the accepted higher dose (600 mg) of clopidogrel, but only against 300 mg
Additional contraindications make prasugrel more complicated than other options: Eg, history of TIA or stroke, >75 y old (give 5 mg/d) 
For low body weight (<60 kg), give 5 mg/d 
STEMI with thrombolytics:
Should not be given
For both STEMI with PCI and UA/NSTEMI with PCI (TRITON-TIMI 38): 
Prasugrel 60 mg load, then 10 mg/d, vs. clopidogrel 300 mg load, 75 mg/d (TRITON-TIMI 38 2007) 
60 mg load, then 10 mg/d
Better against ischemia than 300 mg clopidogrel
Lower death/MI/non-fatal stroke rates (12.1% vs. 9.9%)
Higher major bleeding rates (2.4% vs. 1.8%)
Not tested against clopidogrel 600 mg
STEMI with PCI: 
As above
Give 60 mg at the time of PCI
UA/NSTEMI with PCI
As above
Give 60 mg at the time of PCI
Do not give upstream
ACCOAST trial
Prasugrel 30 mg given upstream followed by 30 mg at angiography, as compared with 60 mg given at angiography, had more bleeding with the same ischemic outcomes 
The median time from symptom onset to angiography was 19 h
Prasugrel in UA/NSTEMI without PCI: Do not use prasugrel (not studied in this group).
In a large randomized trial (ISAR-REACT 5) comparing prasugrel with ticagrelor in both STEMI and non-STEMI, prasugrel started after angiography (vs. ticagrelor started at the time of randomization) and continued for 1 y had significantly better 1-year ischemic outcomes than ticagrelor, with no excess bleeding. However, all exclusions were applied to both groups (eg, no h/o stroke or TIA)  (Exclusions can be found only in the online appendix).
Ticagrelor
Does not require metabolic activation, unlike clopidogrel (and to a lesser extent, prasugrel); thus, has a faster onset.
Not a thienopyridine.
Reversible inhibition (unlike clopidogrel) enhances the rate of the offset of action but is also more risky in non-compliant patients.
PLATO (both STEMI and NSTEMI, both with PCI): 
Ticagrelor 180 mg load, then 90 mg BID vs. clopidogrel 300 mg or 600 mg (physician choice)
Decreased primary composite outcome (9.8% vs. 11.7%)
1.4% decreased all-cause mortality (4.5% vs. 5.9%)
STEMI (or OMI) or unstable NSTEMI undergoing primary emergency PCI:
The best choice for STEMI. Give upstream, 180 mg 
STEMI with thrombolytics:
Do not give
NSTEMI (NOMI) sent for PCI within 24 h:
Very good choice
Upstream only, according to institutional protocols:
Probably withhold, since the CABG risk is high
If given, outcomes may be better
However, CABG patients cannot be operated on for 3 d
NSTEMI with very delayed PCI (>24 h):
This is a poorly studied problem.
Many centers do not perform PCI over the weekend.
These centers may also use UFH, not LMWH (no enoxaparin or fondaparinux).
Patients may wait with inadequate platelet inhibition for up to 72 h (although such waits are associated with worse outcomes, especially with a GRACE score >140). 
The recent VERDICT randomized patients to early (<24 h, mean of 4.6 h) vs. delayed (48-72 h, mean of 60 h) angiography +/- PCI. 
All patients received optimal DAPT ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 600 mg.
All patients received optimal antithrombotic therapy with fondaparinux, and bolus heparin at the time of PCI.
Even with optimal DAPT and antithrombotic therapies, patients at a high risk (GRACE scores >140) trended to do better with early PCI.
Thus, for patients waiting >24 h for PCI, the authors of this review recommend optimal early DAPT and enoxaparin or fondaparinux at the time of diagnosis. Do not wait for PCI.
UA/NSTEMI without PCI:
Good choice
Must use low-dose aspirin (75 mg) 
PCI vs. without PCI (medical or invasive):
Better than clopidogrel 
Cangrelor
IV, very fast onset, given at the time of angiogram before PCI.
Approximately ½ of patients still have high platelet reactivity at 2 h for prasugrel 60 mg and ticagrelor 180 mg. 
Renal patients are not likely to benefit. 
If a patient is already on one P2Y12 (eg, clopidogrel) and has new ACS, then:
Administer a different P2Y12 (eg, ticagrelor).
Relative contraindications to P2Y12 inhibitors
Increased risk of bleeding
History of hemorrhagic stroke
Anemia
Thrombocytopenia
Active bleeding
Summary recommendations: P2Y12 receptor inhibitors
STEMI with thrombolytics:
Clopidogrel at 300 mg is the only P2Y12 receptor inhibitor that has been proven safe and effective. 
75 mg in patients >75 y old, 600 mg has not been studied (not proven safe).
STEMI with PCI (or any ACS going immediately to the catheter lab):
Upstream (in the ED or prehospital) administration is recommended by guidelines.
Upstream is possibly better than at the time of PCI, but this fact is not unequivocally proven. 
Ticagrelor: 180 mg, then 90 BID is recommended by guidelines 
Chew: Faster onset. 
Ticagrelor has better ischemic outcomes than clopidogrel (PLATO trial) and a faster onset. 
Slightly more bleeding occurs with ticagrelor.
However, the bleeding study was only compared with 300 mg clopidogrel.
300 mg is known to be inferior to 600 mg.
It remains possible that clopidogrel 600 mg equals ticagrelor 180 mg, but the guidelines support ticagrelor.
Ticagrelor is safer if the patient ultimately needs CABG (shorter-acting).
Prasugrel and cangrelor are good alternatives, but are not given upstream in the ED, only by the angiographer after the patient’s anatomy has been defined.
Clopidogrel 600 mg is acceptable. 
Clopidogrel: A double dose is better
600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on days 2-7, and 75 mg qD thereafter 
In STEMI, the bleeding risk if CABG becomes necessary is countered by the need to immediately open the culprit vessel with PCI.
PCI always requires DAPT.
CABG is significantly less common in STEMI than NSTEMI.
STEMI:
ATLANTIC: <2% 
NSTEMI:
>10% with CABG 
16% in the CURE trial 
UA/NSTEMI with PCI:
Must be given but is probably not best to give upstream.
ACEP Clinical Policy equivocal 
May be best to define the patient’s anatomy first
Be certain that the patient does not require CABG.
Then, give prior to PCI.
Give upstream, or not, only in accordance with the institutional protocol.
Ticagrelor: 180 mg, then 90 mg BID
Chew: Faster onset
In particular, beware of the upstream administration of any P2Y12 inhibitor when there is widespread ST depression, with ST elevation in aVR of ≥1 mm.
46% of these patients needed CABG. 
However, there is good evidence for its safety and efficacy even in the CABG group if there is a washout period before CABG.
ACUITY (non-randomized): 
Editorial 
1,539 of 13,800 had CABG, 5-d washout before CABG.
Patients had a longer length of stay by 3 d.
30-d death/MI/revasc.: 17.3% vs. 12.7%.
A non-significant CABG bleed difference was recorded.
Prasugrel: Proven not to be better when given upstream (ischemic outcomes are no different than when given at the time of angiography, but more bleeding does occur). 
ACCOAST trial
Prasugrel:
30 mg upstream followed by 30 mg at angiography, as compared with 60 mg at angiography, had more bleeding with the same ischemic outcomes. 
A median of 19 h from symptom onset to angiography was recorded.
Clopidogrel:
Double dose: 600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on days 2-7, and 75 mg qD thereafter 
UA/NSTEMI without PCI (medical therapy):
Use depends on the cost and patient response to clopidogrel.
Clopidogrel 600 mg, then 75 mg qD.
Prasugrel is equal to clopidogrel. 
Ticagrelor was shown to be better than clopidogrel (early and sustained outcomes), at 180 mg, then 90 mg BID.
Chew: Faster onset 
NSTEMI (NOMI) going for PCI within 24 h:
According to the institutional protocols only
Probably withhold, since the CABG risk is high
If given early, outcomes may be better
However, CABG patients cannot undergo surgery for 3 d.
NSTEMI with very delayed PCI (>24 h):
This is a poorly studied problem.
Many centers do not perform PCI over the weekend.
These centers may also use UFH, rather than LMWH (no enoxaparin or fondaparinux).
UFH with aspirin may not provide enough antiplatelet and antithrombotic activity.
Patients may wait with inadequate platelet inhibition for up to 72 h (although such waits are associated with worse outcomes, especially with a GRACE score >140). 
Aspirin + heparin benefit over aspirin alone did not reach statistical significance in a meta-analysis. 
GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors (GPIs)
GPIs are powerful antiplatelet agents.
GPIs should not be used in patients with a high bleeding risk.
The use of GPIs in the ED may depend on hospital protocol, but they are usually not administered in the ED (no “pretreatment,” not “upstream”).
Abciximab
Eptifibatide
Tirofiban
Before the era of P2Y12 inhibitors, GPIs routinely decreased ischemic outcomes in randomized trials, but after the advent of routine 600 mg clopidogrel, and other P2Y12 inhibitors, many negative trials appeared, especially in biomarker-negative patients. 
GPI in STEMI with PCI:
Not recommended.
The benefit was established before the use of P2Y12 inhibitors, but not after. 
“Overall, there is no evidence to recommend the routine use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors for primary PCI.” 
In short, GPIs for STEMI should ideally be reserved for use by the interventionist during PCI, and this is usually for “bail-out” when other therapies are failing.
Early (ED, “upstream”) administration of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors in STEMI:
Without P2Y12 inhibitors, upstream pretreatment with abciximab was shown to be beneficial at one point.
A meta-analysis of randomized trials reported significant reduction in mortality (primary endpoint) (20% vs. 24.6%), better preprocedural thrombolysis in MI (TIMI) 3 flow (21.6% vs. 10.1%), improved post-procedural TIMI 3 flow (90% vs. 84.8%), improved myocardial perfusion as evaluated by post-procedural myocardial blush grade (MBG) 3 (52.0% vs. 43.2%), improved ST-segment resolution (58.4% vs. 43.5%), and decreased distal embolization (10.1% vs. 16.2%).
No difference in major bleeding (3.3% vs. 2.3%) was observed. 
Administration occurred a mean of 80 min earlier in the upstream group.
If the time to angiography is significantly faster, the advantage may be significantly less.
However, none of the studies used P2Y12 inhibitors.
“Facilitated” PCI: PCI with the upstream use of GPI, thrombolytics, or both.
According to a quantitative review of 17 heterogeneous trials, 9 of which used GPIs alone (others used thrombolytics +/- GPI), there is no proven beneficial role of upstream pretreatment with GPIs (or with thrombolytics). 
Facilitated PCI with fibrinolytic therapy had significantly higher rates of mortality, non-fatal re-infarction, urgent target-vessel revascularization, total and hemorrhagic stroke, and major bleeding as compared with primary PCI. No differences in efficacy or safety were observed when facilitated PCI with (an upstream) GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor was compared with primary PCI.
ASSENT-4 PCI (ASSENT, and investigators, Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Treatment Strategy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention): 
STEMI with an anticipated delay to PCI of at least 1 h
½-dose reteplase + abciximab followed by PCI vs.
Abciximab alone followed by PCI vs.
Placebo + PCI, +/- GPI at the time of the procedure.
The reteplase group was observed to have an increased hospital death rate (6% vs. 3%)
This poor result was blamed on the lack of a heparin infusion after the bolus in the reteplase group, no upfront loading of clopidogrel, and no GPI administration.
FINESSE: 
Pretreatment with reteplase + abciximab, then PCI vs.
Pretreatment with abciximab vs.
Abciximab at the time of PCI.
All patients received aspirin and low-dose UFH or low-dose enoxaparin.
There was no mention of the use of a P2Y12 inhibitor (not given).
No difference in outcomes was observed.
GPIs at the time of angiography (not “upstream”):
With the P2Y12 inhibitor ticlopidine:
Montalescot,  in the ADMIRAL study, found that abciximab at the time of angiography in patients given the P2Y12 inhibitor ticlopidine decreased the incidence of death or re-infarction from 19.0% to 12.9%, NNT = 17. This treatment was not given upstream. The authors concluded that, in stenting for STEMI, abciximab is better than placebo, even when the patient is given a P2Y12 inhibitor.
It is unclear whether this advantage would remain with the administration of more effective P2Y12 inhibitors.
GPIs in STEMI with thrombolytics:
Not recommended.
The ASSENT-3 study reported that TNK-tPA + enoxaparin was equivalent to ½-dose TNK-tPA + abciximab + UFH, both regimens were better than TNK-tPA + full-dose UFH, and TNK-tPA + enoxaparin is the easiest combination. 
The GUSTO-V study reported that reteplase vs. ½-dose reteplase and abciximab led to no difference in the 1-y mortality. 
A double dose of eptifibatide plus ½-dose TNK-tPA improved angiographic flow but was associated with increased bleeding.
UA/NSTEMI with PCI:
“It is reasonable to give GPI at the time of PCI.” 
The benefit of abciximab was shown if given at the time of PCI, even in patients who were given a full dose of clopidogrel (600 mg). 
Upstream (pretreatment) with GPIs:
Only give GPIs upstream if approved by an interventionist.
Interventionist approval may happen when a P2Y12 inhibitor cannot be given for some reason (eg, high CABG risk, as in diffuse ST depression with ST elevation in aVR). 
Important study. Giugliano et al: 
All patients received clopidogrel and an anticoagulant (UFH or enoxaparin).
Treatment was randomized to upstream eptifibatide vs. eptifibatide only at the time of PCI.
Outcome: Death/MI/revasc.: 9.3% in upstream, 10.0% in control.
However, with P = .21, there was an almost significantly better result for each of these groups, independently:
NSTEMI (“positive” troponin, not just unstable angina)
Time to randomization <4 h
UFH (not enoxaparin)
This study was considered negative.
The authors of this reference text interpret these results as follows:
If the patient 1) has a positive troponin; 2) is being treated rapidly; and 3) is not being treated with enoxaparin,
Then eptifibatide is probably beneficial.
UA/NSTEMI without PCI:
Not indicated.
Abciximab has been proven ineffective. 
Anticoagulant Therapy for ACS
All anticoagulant therapies in ACS should be decided in a protocolized, multi-disciplinary fashion. The following is meant to aid the development of those protocols.
Background
Angiography and PCI must always be in the setting of anticoagulation to avoid immediate procedural thrombosis.
This is taken as common knowledge among a wide variety of intravascular procedures and is supported by small, old studies:
Improvements were observed in angiographic success, with a decreased immediate post-procedural thrombotic vessel occlusion. 
The benefit of anticoagulation in patients undergoing immediate or urgent PCI is assured based on the procedural benefit alone, regardless of any other possible benefits listed below.
The original evidence for anticoagulation vs. placebo in ACS without invasive therapy includes:
All evidence from the 1980s-1990s, without invasive therapy and before dual antiplatelet therapy.
The meta-analysis by Oler et al.: 
Six trials met the inclusion criteria, with 1,353 “unstable angina” patients (which includes many likely NSTEMI or even STEMI cases as classified today).
Aspirin + heparin vs. aspirin + placebo/control
The duration of the therapy ranged between trials, from 2-7 d
Results: The incidence of composite results (MI or death):
During heparin treatment (between 2-7 d): “strong trend” 10.4% (control) vs. 7.9% (heparin), RR 0.67 (0.44-1.02), NNT = 40, but not statistically significant
At 2-12 wk after treatment: No statistical difference, RR 0.82 (0.56 - 1.20)
Authors’ conclusion: “Since the anticoagulant effects of heparin are brief, any benefit of therapy is unlikely to last beyond the duration of treatment. Consistent with this theory, we found no reduction in the risk of MI or death between 2 and 12 weeks following randomization in patients with unstable angina who received heparin and aspirin as compared with those who received aspirin alone. This result underscores that heparin is a short-acting, temporizing therapy, and not an intervention that alters underlying atherosclerotic disease.”
The benefit of anticoagulation from these original studies is controversial, since many authors point out rebound infarction rates after heparin discontinuation, such that the long-term rates of MI were not different between groups.
The conclusion of the authors of this reference text is in favor of giving anticoagulation treatment to all patients with confirmed, active ACS without contraindications. This conclusion was developed based on the following considerations:
Patient benefit in the setting of PCI is unquestioned, and the clinician cannot always know which NSTE-ACS patients will or will not receive PCI in the ED.
Heparin as a bridge to definitive therapy in the invasive care era has never been studied. Even so, heparin administration seems to be supported indirectly by the transient protection from MI granted by anticoagulation as a bridge to PCI for patients with unstable plaques, which is the entire basis of the pathophysiology of ACS.
The authors of this reference agree with the interpretation of the European guidelines: “Recurrence of events after interruption of UFH explains why this benefit is not maintained over time, unless the patient is revascularized before the interruption of unfractionated heparin.”
Recommendations of the current guidelines
STEMI with PCI:
Administer UFH (I,C) or bivalirudin (I,B) bolus prior to PCI.
ESC lists UFH as class I and enoxaparin as class IIa.
Enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg was shown to yield slightly better outcomes than UFH and is listed as an option by the ESC. 
The ACC/AHA Guidelines mention enoxaparin as an alternative but give no formal recommendation level. These guidelines also reference an RCT showing favorable outcomes of enoxaparin vs. UFH. 
Avoid fondaparinux due to the increased incidence of PCI catheter thrombosis. 
Fondaparinux may be used if a standard bolus of UFH is given at the time of PCI.
STEMI with thrombolytics:
UFH (I,C), enoxaparin (I,A), fondaparinux (I,B).
Exception: Streptokinase (which is not fibrin-specific like the others) does not require simultaneous anticoagulation therapy.
NSTEMI/UA:
Administer enoxaparin (I,A), UFH, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux (I,B) until PCI is performed, then as above for anticoagulation therapy with PCI.
Practical considerations
Do not mix UFH and enoxaparin, due to the increased bleeding risk. 
If the interventionist only uses UFH in the catheter lab, then the patient should receive UFH in the ED unless there is a definitive reason for non-invasive management.
The heparin anticoagulation level is monitored in the catheter lab using the activated clotting time (ACT).
STEMI with PCI:
UFH: 5,000 units (for patients ≥50 kg), 4,500 units (45-50 kg), 4,000 units (40-45 kg) IV bolus. Alternatively, some authors use 60 units/kg (max 4,000-5,000 units) IV bolus.
Bivalirudin: 0.75 mg/kg IV bolus.
Low-molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin, etc.) is not indicated.
Synthetic anti-Xa (fondaparinux) is not indicated.
STEMI with thrombolytics (without PCI):
Enoxaparin is the optimal choice: 
If <75 y old: 30 mg IV bolus, followed in 15 min by 1 mg/kg (max 100 mg for the first dose)
If ≥75 y old: No bolus, 0.75 mg/kg SC (max 75 mg for the first dose)
UFH: 5,000 units (≥50 kg), 4,500 units (45-50 kg), 4,000 units (40-45 kg) IV bolus. Alternatively, some authors use 60 units/kg (max 4,000-5,000 units) IV bolus.
Fondaparinux: Initial dose 2.5 mg IV, contraindicated if CrCl <30 mL/min.
Only give if the thrombolytic drug is streptokinase. 
UA and NSTEMI with PCI:
Enoxaparin is superior to UFH, with more predictable anticoagulation and less bleeding. 
Preferred by ESC. 
The ACC/AHA give both enoxaparin and UFH a class-I recommendation, but only enoxaparin has an appropriate level of evidence supporting its use. 
This approach requires no lab monitoring, although anti-Xa levels may be monitored.
Nevertheless, many interventionists prefer UFH, because:
They are accustomed to UFH and to using the ACT to monitor anticoagulation.
UFH is more easily reversible with protamine.
Many authors who promote UFH invoke the SYNERGY trial, which randomized patients with non-STE-ACS to enoxaparin vs. UFH. 
All patients received aspirin and a GPI.
62% in both groups received clopidogrel.
Death or MI 14.0% (enox) vs. 14.5% (UFH); no significant difference.
However, the trial was fatally flawed:
⅓ of patients in each group had been initiated on the other anticoagulant prior to randomization (“crossovers”).
If there was no pre-randomization therapy, or if the pre- and post- therapies were the same, then:
13.3% for enox and 15.9% for UFH.
The crossover patients had a significantly higher bleeding rate.
Enoxaparin dosing: 
If <75 y old: 30 mg IV bolus, followed in 15 min by 1 mg/kg (max 100 mg for the first dose)
If ≥75 y old: No bolus, 0.75 mg/kg SC (max 75 mg for the first dose)
For CrCl 15-29 mL/min, 1 mg/kg qD, and monitor anti-Xa activity 
For CrCl <15 mL/min, not recommended
If >8 h has elapsed since the last dose, give 0.3 mg/kg IV prior to PCI
Crossing over to another anticoagulant is strongly discouraged
Give for the duration of hospitalization
Unfractionated heparin dosing:
Initial loading dose of 60 units/kg (max 4,000 units)
Initial infusion of 12 units/kg/h (max 1,000 units/h)
Adjusted to therapeutic aPTT range
In the catheter lab, adjusted to the activated clotting time (ACT)
Fondaparinux: The best safety and efficacy profile if a bolus of UFH is given at the time of angiography:
2.5 mg SC qD
Continue throughout hospitalization
Contraindicated if CrCl <30 mL/min
Associated with catheter thrombosis at the time of PCI:
OASIS-5 randomized patients to enoxaparin vs. fondaparinux: 
Enox had 0.3% catheter thrombosis; fondaparinux had 0.9%.
These values are significantly higher than historical controls with heparin or enoxaparin.
These data serve as strong evidence in support of the need for antithrombotic therapy during PCI.
However, this treatment is very safe and effective if a standard bolus dose (85 U/kg) of UFH is given at the time of PCI. 
0.1% incidence of catheter thrombosis
In patients receiving a GPI, the UFH dose should be 50 units/kg.
ESC guidelines: “Overall, fondaparinux is considered the parenteral anticoagulant with the most favourable efficacy–safety profile and is recommended regardless of the management strategy, unless the patient is scheduled for immediate coronary angiography.” 
UA/NSTEMI with medical therapy only (non-invasive):
Enoxaparin and fondaparinux are superior to UFH.
Fondaparinux is the best.
Some authors advocate for dosing with anticoagulants that incorporate the ideal (IBW) vs. total body weight (TBW):
Heparin:
Loading dose = IBW + 0.4 (TBW-IBW), 60 units/kg
Maintenance infusion = IBW + 0.4 (TBW-IBW), 12 units/kg/h
A comparison between anticoagulant regimens can be complex, is likely not relevant to the ED, and is best made in institution-specific agreements with interventionists.
Routine Medical Treatment of ACS
Beta adrenergic blockers
Consider giving beta blockers acutely in the ED for ACS with ongoing ischemia and significant hypertension believed to be contributing to supply/demand mismatch, in the absence of contraindications.
The current ACC/AHA guidelines:
STEMI: Class IIa, LOE B recommendation for immediate beta blockade, stating “it is reasonable to administer IV beta blockers at the time of presentation to patients with STEMI and no contraindications to their use who are hypertensive or have ongoing ischemia.”
NSTEMI: (Oral) beta blockers recommended for all ACS within the first 24 h without contraindications, but there is no strong evidence or recommendation that beta blockers should be started in the ED.
Beta blockers are contraindicated in patients with signs of CHF (Killip class III or IV), low cardiac output (SBP <120, sinus rhythm HR <60 or >110 bpm), a high risk of cardiogenic shock, elderly (>70 y old), heart block, or any signs of acute SA or AV node dysfunction (most commonly seen in RCA occlusions).
Consider one of the following two practices regarding early beta blockade (in the ED) for patients with STEMI (therefore, also relevant to occlusion MI):
Interpretation 1: “The COMMIT trial was so large that it overrules benefit signals from other trials, and although the mortality was not different between groups, cardiogenic shock is harder to treat than dysrhythmias, therefore no beta blockers until further evidence.”
Interpretation 2: “The cardiogenic shock seen in the COMMIT trial was overwhelmingly seen in the high-risk groups (HR >110, SBP <120, >70 y old), which are excluded in the other trials showing benefit. The literature taken together shows benefit for beta blockers if you exclude those at risk of cardiogenic shock.”
Underlying evidence:
COMMIT trial: 
45,852 STEMI patients randomized to immediate placebo vs. metoprolol (15 mg IV metoprolol (5 mg q5min ×3 doses) followed by 50 mg PO then 200 mg sustained-release starting on d-20).
The patients receiving primary PCI were excluded.
The other exclusion criteria included SBP <100, HR <50, and cardiogenic shock.
The patient group was characterized by fairly late presentation ACS (the mean time from symptom onset to thrombolysis was 10.3 h).
The mortality at 4 wk was not different between the groups (7.7% vs. 7.8%, P = .69).
The metoprolol group had a lower incidence of recurrent infarction (2.0% vs. 2.5%, P = .001) and ventricular fibrillation (2.5% vs. 3.0%, P = .001) after day 1 and a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock within the first 24 h (5.0% vs. 3.9%, P < .001), especially in the high-risk groups (>70 y old, SBP <120, HR >110, Killip class III).
Early metoprolol in STEMI patients undergoing PCI by Ibanez et al.: 
270 anterior STEMI patients with Killip class II or less undergoing PCI with an anticipated symptom onset-to-reperfusion time of 6 h, randomized to immediate metoprolol (3× 5 mg doses 2 min apart) vs. control (no placebo), with all patients in both arms being started on oral metoprolol 12-24 h after infarction.
Exclusions: SBP <120, PR interval >240 ms, second- or third-degree AV block, HR <60, or active beta blocker treatment.
Primary outcome: The mean (SD) infarct size by MRI was smaller after early IV metoprolol as compared with the control (25.615.3 vs. 32.022.2 g; adjusted difference -6.52; 95% CI -11.39 to -1.78, P = .012).
Malignant ventricular dysrhythmias occurred in 5/140 given metoprolol and 10/130 given placebo (P = NS).
The composite of death, ventricular arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, AV block, and re-infarction at 24 h in the metoprolol and control groups was 7.1% vs. 12.3% (P = .21).
The long-term, 2-y outcome presented in Pizarro et al.  based on the primary composite outcome of death, HF admission, reinfarction, and malignant arrhythmias in the metoprolol and control groups was 10.8% vs. 18.3% (P = .065).
Roolvink et al. 2016:
Randomized 683 STEMI patients to metoprolol (2× 5 mg IV bolus) or placebo before primary PCI.
Primary outcome (only assessed in 55% of all patients): Infarct size by MRI did not differ between the metoprolol and placebo groups, 15.3%, 11.0% vs. 14.9%, 11.5% (P = .616).
The incidence of malignant arrhythmias in the metoprolol vs. placebo groups was 3.6% vs. 6.9% (P = .050).
Agent and dosing options:
Metoprolol: 5 mg IV push over 1-2 min, q5 min ×3
Esmolol: 250-500 µg/kg IV push over 1 min, followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 µg/kg/min
Authors‘ recommendations:
If there are no contraindications (no HF, SBP at least 120, no tachycardia, no AV block), metoprolol 5 mg IV ×3, with oral metoprolol given later if tolerated, seems to convey benefit prior to PCI in anterior MI.
Anterior MI patients treated with PCI (not fibrinolytics) without contraindications to beta blockers, who are anticipated to undergo PCI within 6 h of symptom onset and who have an SBP >120, appear to benefit from 3× 5 mg doses of IV metoprolol given prior to PCI. All patients without contraindications benefit from oral metoprolol after PCI.
Calcium channel blockers
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) given with the intent of decreasing myocardial oxygen demand have very little role in the ED treatment of ACS in normal sinus rhythm, and are only mentioned in the guidelines in specific downstream scenarios as a substitute for beta blockers that have proven ineffective or are contraindicated, or in the chronic management of coronary artery spasm. 
Held et al.  performed a systematic review including 19,000 ACS patients in 28 trials, showing no effect on the risk of death or initial/recurrent infarction when given routinely for AMI or UA.
CCBs may reasonably used to lower heart rate, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, in patients who are experiencing rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation/flutter or supraventricular tachycardia in the setting of ACS.
CCBs are relatively contraindicated in patients with reduced systolic LV function for fear of acutely worsened cardiac output and hypotension.
Example clinical case: A middle-aged male presenting with intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath over the past 2-3 d. The initial ECG shows clear inferoposterior injury current [STEMI(+)], with regular narrow tachycardia consistent with SVT or atrial flutter. Diltiazem 15 mg IV push was administered with rapid conversion to sinus rhythm and improvement in clinical symptoms. Immediate post-conversion ECG shows reduction in ST segment elevation and the beginnings of reperfusion. Immediate angiography revealed a diffuse three-vessel disease with >90% lesions in both the RCA and LCX, but the angiographers were unable to tell whether the lesions were acute culprits or chronic lesions. Regardless, the dysrhythmia had to be terminated immediately to reduce significant supply/demand mismatch due to the rapid ventricular response. ECG
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
The early initiation of ACE inhibitors has been shown to reduce short- and long-term mortality in patients with AMI, with benefit demonstrated as early as 24 h after admission. 
However, ACE inhibitors should be used with caution within the first 24 h, since they may result in hypotension and/or renal dysfunction. 
Thus, it is not necessary to start ACE inhibitors in the ED, but ACE inhibitors are an important adjunct to ACS therapy.
HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins)
In addition to the long-term preventive mechanisms of statins for ACS, there are potential benefits in the acute setting of ACS attributed to the so-called “pleiotropic” effects of statins, including the inhibition of inflammatory and coagulation cascades and thrombus formation. 
Both the 2013 STEMI and 2014 NSTEMI guidelines recommend the initiation (or continuation) of statin therapy but do not specify whether these therapies should begin in the ED or further downstream.
Although there is currently a lack of ED-specific data regarding “upstream” (ED) initiation of statin therapy, various benefits can be inferred from related PCI trials and systematic reviews. For example, Benjo,  Patti et al,  Navarese,  and Harari  each performed meta-analyses showing reduced rates of periprocedural MI and other short-term clinical outcomes for ACS patients who received statins prior to PCI.
SECURE-PCI trial: 
Design: Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT at 53 sites in Brazil
Population: Any ACS patient (with or without STE) judged to require coronary angiography for ACS evaluation.
Intervention: Randomized to 2 doses of 80 mg atorvastatin or matching placebo before and 24 h after planned PCI. All patients received 40 mg atorvastatin for 30 d starting 24 h after the second dose of study medication.
Primary outcome: MACE = all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, unplanned coronary revascularization at 30 d.
Results:
4,191 patients, mean age 62 y old, 26% women.
At 30 d, no significant difference was observed in MACE (6.2% atorvastatin group, 7.1% placebo group).
Subgroup analysis: Two subgroups with benefit.
STEMI: 4.1% absolute decrease in MACE at 30 d, NNT = 25.
PCI: 2.2% absolute decrease in MACE at 30 d, NNT = 46.
In the absence of further data, we suggest that it is reasonable to give the first dose of statin ASAP in any patient with ongoing ACS with either:
Atorvastatin: 80 mg
Rosuvastatin: 40 mg
Special Circumstances
ACS in Cardiac Arrest
Attempt defibrillation for VF/VT and initiate high-quality CPR.
Consider transvenous pacemaker placement for significant bradycardia contributing to cardiogenic shock refractory to standard ACLS and transcutaneous pacing when there will be a significant delay to the catheter lab.
VF/VT refractory to multiple defibrillations and standard ACLS:
Ensure optimal pad placement.
Consider dual sequential defibrillation, although there is concern for potential concealed damage to the defibrillator, which is not well understood at this time.
Consider esmolol:
Driver el al.  retrospectively studied 25 patients in refractory VF/VT.
6 patients received esmolol, while the other 19 did not.
The esmolol group had higher rates of ROSC (67% vs. 32%) and survival with good neurologic outcomes (50% vs. 11%).
Consider V-A ECMO followed by emergency PCI in patients deemed salvageable with a good baseline quality of life.
See Chapter: Cardiac Arrest for further information relevant to general cardiac arrest management.
Which Cardiac Arrest Patients with ROSC Require the Catheter Lab?
All patients with STEMI on ECG require the catheter lab.
Should patients with initial shockable rhythm who do not have diagnostic ST elevation be sent to the catheter lab?
This is controversial.
Non-randomized trials suggest benefit.
No randomized trial has shown benefit. 
This trial had a small proportion of patients with OMI.
This may be due to avoidance of the enrollment of patients with high suspicion of OMI, in spite of the enrollment criteria.
However, 32% of such patients have a culprit lesion that requires intervention. 
Further data are needed, but if OMI is suspected, even in the absence of STEMI, the authors of this review text recommend catheter lab activation.
ACS with Cardiogenic Shock
The differential of cardiogenic shock in the setting of ACS is based on pump failure (LV and/or RV), and mechanical complications (papillary rupture, free wall rupture, etc.). See the Complications section.
As many as 10%-13% of STEMI cases are complicated by cardiogenic shock. 
The classic mortality rates in cardiogenic shock are reported to be up to ~80%; however, more recent registries report average mortality rates: 
In hospital: 30%-45%
1 y: 40%-55%
ACS with resulting cardiogenic shock is an indication for emergency PCI, regardless of ECG findings or the time since the onset of symptoms.
The current guidelines give a class I, level B recommendation for emergency PCI of STEMI in cardiogenic shock, regardless of the time since onset.
The current guidelines recommend (I,B) fibrinolytics for STEMI patients with cardiogenic shock who are unsuitable candidates for either PCI or CABG.
Many authors report that fibrinolysis is not effective in ACS with circulatory shock (since the thrombus is less exposed to the fibrinolytic agent). However, a review of the available literature seems to contradict this belief:
FTT meta-analysis: 
Very few of the included studies recorded actual “cardiogenic shock”, but almost all recorded hypotension (SBP <100) and tachycardia (HR >100).
GISSI-1 (one of the few that recorded Killip class on arrival):
Among those in Killip class 3 HF (but not cardiogenic shock), a 6% absolute mortality reduction was recorded, with almost identical relative risk reductions in patients designated as Killip class 1 and 2 (RR = 0.77) as expected, but this difference was not statistically significant due to being underpowered (total N with Killip class 3 = 437, vs. a necessary calculated sample size of ~2,000).
Among the 280 patients with Killip class 4, there was no difference in mortality (70% in both groups).
Other trials in FTT did not report the Killip class but did report hypotension and tachycardia:
The 35-d mortality was significantly reduced in hypotensive (SBP <100) patients (6.2% absolute mortality difference, 28.9% vs. 35.1%, NNT = 16) as compared with normotensive (SBP = 100-149) patients (1.9% absolute mortality difference, 9.6% vs. 11.5%, NNT = 53), ΔNNT = 37 for hypotension.
The 35-d mortality was also reduced in tachycardic (HR >100) patients (3.3% absolute mortality difference, 17.4% vs. 20.7%, NNT = 30) and showed a consistent pattern of more benefit as the HR increases (<80 bpm, NNT = 79; 80-99 bpm, NNT = 48; 100+ bpm, NNT = 30).
For context with regard to how impressive these benefits are for hypotension and tachycardia, the mortality benefit of using ST elevation vs. no ST elevation in these studies (absolute mortality benefit 2.4%, 10.4% vs. 12.%, NNT = 42) was actually less than using either hypotension or tachycardia instead of STE.
FTT conclusion: “Overall, therefore, the large trials indicate that fibrinolytic therapy is especially effective among high-risk patients presenting with hypotension and/or tachycardia, many of whom would have been in HF or cardiogenic shock. Hypotension, HF, or even, perhaps, shock should not, therefore, be contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy or, indeed, other reperfusion strategies.”
Therefore, we highly recommend thrombolytics in hypotensive and/or tachycardic STEMI patients who cannot receive timely PCI.
Emergency PCI is superior to thrombolytics in STEMI with cardiogenic shock, and emergency PCI is superior to “medical stabilization” with delayed PCI in this group.
The SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial: 
The mortality rates at 6 and 12 mo were significantly reduced in patients with emergency angiography vs. those with delayed angiography (53.3% vs. 66.4%, absolute mortality difference 13.1%, NNT = 8), despite the fact that nearly ⅔ of the delayed group received fibrinolytics.
The benefit in this group was apparent up to 54 h after the onset of MI and 18 h after the onset of cardiogenic shock.
Multiple non-randomized registry studies have shown that emergency PCI is associated with benefit in cardiogenic shock, even in the high-risk elderly population who was offered PCI. 
Adjunct therapies to emergency reperfusion in ACS with cardiogenic shock:
Optimize the preload with fluids/blood as necessary based on hematocrit and fluid tolerance.
Consider intubation, mechanical ventilation, and paralysis to reduce the demand for cardiac output during the delay to definitive management.
Vasopressors in cardiogenic shock:
Norepinephrine is first-line, then consider adding dobutamine for persistent low cardiac output after norepinephrine. 
Rui et al.  conducted a meta-analysis of norepinephrine vs. dopamine.
9 studies were incorporated with 510 patients randomized to norepinephrine vs. dopamine.
The 28-d mortality was lower in the norepinephrine group (30%) vs. the dopamine group (50%), RR 1.611 (95% CI 1.219-2.129); P  <  .001.
A lower incidence of dysrhythmic events was recorded in the norepinephrine group (8%) vs. the dopamine group (28%) RR 3.426 (95% CI 2.120-5.510); P  <  .001.
Correct and prevent dysrhythmias (VT and VF).
Replenish magnesium >2.0 mEq/L and potassium to 4.0-4.5 mEq/L
See Chapter: Tachydysrhythmias
Consider V-A ECMO to restore perfusion and prevent cardiac arrest while arranging for emergency PCI if the patient is worsening despite the above therapies.
When to Transport ACS to a PCI-capable Facility
STEMI:
If the delay to PCI (DTBT minus DTNT) is <60 min, then transfer immediately for primary PCI; if not, give thrombolytics and transfer. 
However, the time since the onset of symptoms and ECG evidence of ischemic time should also be considered.
Table.
All patients who receive thrombolytics should be transferred immediately to a PCI-capable facility.
Confirmed ACS patients with refractory angina or persistent hemodynamic/electrical instability warrant immediate catheterization according to current guidelines and should be transferred promptly as STEMI would be, except that lytics are not indicated in NSTEMI.
Confirmed ACS patients without emergency PCI indications (without ongoing ischemia) should be risk-stratified to determine whether invasive vs. medical treatment will be pursued, and whether further diagnostic/provocative imaging is necessary before transfer according to institutional protocol.",Acute Coronary Syndromes
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
If the patient is hemodynamically unstable and myopericardial disease is in the differential diagnosis, initiate resuscitation and immediately perform a bedside echocardiogram to look for signs of tamponade
Large pericardial effusion
Right ventricular [RV] collapse
Plethoric inferior vena cava [IVC]) and/or cardiogenic shock (severely depressed left ventricular [LV] contractility).
Unstable patients with cardiac tamponade may require an emergency pericardiocentesis that can be performed in the ED under U/S guidance.
Pericardiocentesis and/or a pericardial window should ideally be performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory or surgical suite (ie, operating room [OR]), time permitting.
Consider fulminant myocarditis (FM) in critically ill patients with circulatory collapse/cardiogenic shock.
Initiate aggressive resuscitation (hemodynamic and respiratory) with IV fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors as needed.
Consult Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery early to evaluate for mechanical circulatory support.
Admit patients to an ICU.
Key Concepts
Although myopericardial diseases are frequently encountered, their highly variable clinical presentation often results in a misdiagnosis, making prompt treatment challenging.
Chest discomfort and ECG changes are often initially mistaken for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
Complications that require emergency evaluation and treatment include the following:
Pericardial effusion and constriction
Cardiac tamponade
Cardiogenic shock
Patients with myocarditis can exhibit varying levels of stability. Vital signs may initially be normal or abnormal and non-specific (ie, unexplained tachycardia or tachypnea).
The clinical presentation of acute myopericardial disease may range from mild constitutional symptoms suggestive of a viral syndrome to severe chest pain and dyspnea that mimics myocardial ischemia to new-onset heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
Patients with FM demonstrate hypotension, respiratory failure, and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion such as oliguria and altered mental status.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Pericarditis
Acute pericarditis is a clinical diagnosis that is made with at least 2 of the following 4 criteria:
Classic chest pain (>85-90% of cases) typically described as sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward and worsened by lying back.
Pericardial friction rub (rare)
Characteristic ECG abnormalities (common but not universal)
New or worsening pericardial effusion
When considering acute myopericardial syndrome vs. ACS based on diffuse ST-segment elevation, first attempt to rule-in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
The following ECG abnormalities are concerning for STEMI:
Reciprocal ST-segment depression (ie, reciprocal changes) in leads other than V1 and aVR.
Horizontal or convex upward ST-segment morphology
Dynamic ECG changes (ECG changes in pericarditis evolve much more slowly than in ACS).
STE in lead III > lead II
If STEMI is considered unlikely based upon the patient’s clinical presentation and ECG review, proceed to look for factors that suggest pericarditis.
The absence of reciprocal change
PR-segment abnormalities (depression in multiple leads and an elevation in the aVR lead).
Myocarditis
Acute myocarditis is usually a presumptive clinical diagnosis, as the definitive diagnosis requires an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) that is not possible in acutely ill or decompensated patients.
A non-invasive method for definitively diagnosing myocarditis with an adequate sensitivity does not currently exist.
The clinical features of myocarditis may be very subtle and non-specific (myalgias, a recent viral upper respiratory infection, gastroenteritis, etc.) and can be mistaken for seemingly more benign entities such as influenza (“summer flu”) or other viral syndromes in otherwise healthy patients.
Symptoms and ECG findings can mimic ACS, and troponin elevations are common with myocarditis and myopericarditis (but not pericarditis). As a result, catheterization laboratory activation for a suspected STEMI or some other unstable ACS presentation frequently occurs in patients with acute myocarditis.
A high index of suspicion is critical, with attention to tachycardia out of proportion to fever and a new or unexplained cardiomegaly/heart failure.
FM is diagnosed when patients have a distinct symptom onset (usually within the past 2 wk) with severe heart failure symptoms, electrical instability, hypotension, or cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic or mechanical circulatory support.
In early or non-specific presentations, myocarditis is frequently not apparent on initial presentation, resulting in a missed or delayed diagnosis.
Treatment
Pericarditis
Patients without high-risk features (See: Disposition) may be discharged with close outpatient follow-up, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and colchicine.
Ibuprofen (eg, 800-1600 mg daily) and ketorolac are now preferred over the once more commonly prescribed indomethacin.
Combination therapy with colchicine is considered first-line for preventing the recurrence of non-bacterial causes of pericarditis but must be continued for at least 6 mo to effectively prevent recurrence.
If the patient is hemodynamically unstable and U/S is immediately available, perform a bedside echocardiogram to look for signs of tamponade (a large pericardial effusion, RV collapse, and a plethoric IVC) or cardiogenic shock (severely depressed LV contractility). EM:RAP Video U/S can also assess volume status, volume responsiveness, and the presence or absence of pulmonary edema or congestion.
An emergency U/S-guided pericardiocentesis for tamponade can be performed at the bedside. An emergency U/S-guided pericardiocentesis or pericardial window for tamponade can also be performed (ideally) in the cardiac catheterization or surgical suite. Consult Interventional Cardiology or Cardiac Surgery if a tamponade is present, but do not delay treatment (ie, pericardiocentesis) in the moribund patient.
Myocarditis
The mainstay of myocarditis therapy is the standard treatment for heart failure.
Critically ill patients with FM may suffer circulatory collapse/cardiogenic shock. Provide aggressive resuscitation (hemodynamic and respiratory) with IV fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors as needed.
Consider early cardiology and surgical consultation for mechanical circulatory support and admit to intensive care.
Once hemodynamic stability is achieved, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta blockers, and diuretics for acute heart failure can be considered as needed.
Disposition
Admission
Pericarditis
Risk-stratify patients to determine disposition.
High-risk features associated with a poor prognosis in acute pericarditis include the following:
Fever (>38 °C)
A subacute course (symptoms over several days without a clear acute onset)
Evidence of a large pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade
Failure to respond to treatment with NSAIDs after 7 d
Pericarditis from an underlying causative process (ie, lupus, uremia, etc.) or with at least one predictor of a poor prognosis warrants hospitalization.
Stable patients without these features can be managed as outpatients with empiric anti-inflammatory medications and short-term follow-up after 1 wk to assess treatment response.
Discharged patients should receive clearly outlined indications for returning to the ED.
Myocarditis
If the diagnosis is suspected, admit patient to a monitored bed.
In many instances, the diagnosis is not suspected and often not established. A patient with unexplained/persistent tachycardia or tachypnea (or some other concerning feature) should be admitted to an acute care unit. The diagnosis is then made once additional information is available during the hospitalization.

Background
Terminology
Myopericardial syndromes include pericarditis, myocarditis, myopericarditis, and perimyocarditis. Figure
Acute pericarditis and myocarditis commonly co-exist. The degree of their respective involvement is variable, giving rise to terminology that attempts to accurately describe their clinical presentations.
Myopericarditis is defined as a primarily pericarditic syndrome with concomitant myocardial involvement, inflammation, and troponin elevation.
Perimyocarditis is a primarily myocarditic syndrome with concomitant pericardial involvement.
In practice, the combined terminology is often used interchangeably, and there is no uniformly adopted definition.
Pericarditis
Inflammation of the pericardium without myocardial involvement or an associated depressed ejection fraction is referred to simply as pericarditis.
Acute pericarditis refers to pericardial inflammation and an acute onset of symptoms. Without treatment, symptoms may last for 4-6 wk before resolving.
When symptoms recur after a previous episode that completely resolved with treatment, the term recurrent or relapsing pericarditis is used.
The term incessant pericarditis is used when symptoms last for more than 4-6 wks but less than 3 mo without remission.
Chronic pericarditis lasts more than 3 mo.
Myocarditis
Isolated inflammation of the myocardium is referred to as myocarditis, which presents with a widely variable spectrum of disease and degree of ventricular dysfunction.
Acute myocarditis presents with symptoms of heart failure that develop over less than 3 mo, whereas chronic myocarditis develops with a less distinct onset of symptoms over a duration greater than 3 mo.
Over time, ventricular dysfunction may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy.
Chronic cases include chronic active (frequent clinical and histologic relapses with ventricular dysfunction) and chronic persistent (persistent clinical symptoms and histologic infiltrates without ventricular dysfunction) forms of myocarditis.
FM is acute myocardial inflammation that presents suddenly after a distinct viral prodrome. It typically lasts less than 2 wk. FM can lead to electrical instability and cardiogenic shock. 
Acute non-fulminant myocarditis (ANM) is distinguished from FM in that the onset is less distinct, the heart failure symptoms are less severe, hypotension is less common, and vasopressor and mechanical circulatory support is generally not needed.
Anatomy and Function of the Pericardium
The pericardium is a flask-shaped, avascular sac that surrounds the heart and the roots of the great vessels. It separates the epicardium from the other mediastinal structures and is attached to the diaphragm and sternum to limit displacement of the heart within the chest during respiration and movement. 
The pericardium consists of an outer sac (fibrous pericardium) and a double-layered inner sac (serous pericardium) with visceral and parietal layers. Figure
The thin visceral layer adheres to the surface of the myocardium and is reflected over the origins of the great vessels.
The parietal layer has a serosal surface (contacts pericardial fluid) and an opposing surface (lines fibrous pericardium).
The pericardium provides a physical barrier to prevent the spread of infection or malignancy. 
The pericardial space contains a small amount of fluid (~5-50 mL of plasma ultrafiltrate) that lubricates the serosal surface of the parietal and visceral layers to reduce friction during cardiac activity and to help maintain transmural cardiac pressures. 
The pericardium is metabolically active and known to produce hormonal modulators of neurotransmission and myocardial contractility. However, the pericardium is not essential for life, and there are few known adverse consequences of the congenital absence or surgical removal of the pericardium. 
An intact pericardium creates a potential space, the pericardial space, that can accommodate only a small reserve volume under normal conditions. The pressure- volume relation of the pericardium is non-linear. Hence, a small acute pericardial effusion may cause cardiac tamponade, whereas slow chronic effusions may stretch the pericardium to accommodate a higher volume of fluid without resultant tamponade physiology.
The pericardium has a limited elasticity, and when its expansile limit is reached, the heart must compete with pressure from pericardial fluid for a fixed intrapericardial volume. 
Pathophysiology of the Pericardium
Pericardial disease primarily includes pericarditis (acute, subacute, or chronic fibrinous, non-effusive, or exudative processes) and its complications, constriction (an acute, subacute, or chronic adhesive or fibrocalcific response), and cardiac tamponade. 
The pericardium’s response to an injury leads to the exudation of fluid, fibrin, and inflammatory cells. Adhesions may develop during healing that may obliterate the pericardial space. These adhesions may also calcify over time. 
The pericardium is affected by virtually every category of disease, including infectious, neoplastic, immune-inflammatory, metabolic, iatrogenic, traumatic, and congenital causes. 
Pathophysiology of Myocarditis
Most of the current data on the pathogenesis of myocarditis are from animal models of post-viral and autoimmune myocarditis.
Most models suggest that myocarditis has 3 phases of progression. The acute phase, which is characterized by host infection, is followed by a host innate and acquired immunologic response. The acute phase involves either recovery or transition to fibrosis with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) over several weeks to months. 
Acute and chronic phases can cause DCM and heart failure.
In most patients, the pathogen is cleared, and the immune response is downregulated with few long-term effects. Some patients, however, are unable to clear the initial infectious insult. Persistent myocyte damage and inflammation can subsequently result in cardiac-specific autoimmune injury. 
Epidemiology
Pericarditis
Acute pericarditis is the most common form of myopericardial disease worldwide. 
Acute pericarditis accounts for only a small percentage of all hospital admissions, as many low-risk patients can be managed as outpatients. Hence, accurate estimates of the incidence and prevalence of pericarditis are not available in many populations. 
The mean age of patients with acute pericarditis is 41-60 y. Men are noted to have a 2-fold greater incidence compared to women. 
Pericarditis is frequently recurrent. Approximately 30% of patients will experience a recurrence of symptoms within 18 mo of the first episode of pericarditis. 
It is estimated that pericarditis accounts for approximately 5% of ED admissions for chest pain-related complaints.  In-hospital mortality is generally low in developed countries but increases with age and comorbidities.
Myocarditis
The incidence of myocarditis is difficult to estimate due to its range of clinical presentations, but it is currently reported to be 22 cases per 100,000 persons per year. The increasing adoption of highly-sensitive troponin assays has dramatically increased the number of reported cases. 
As many as 1-5% of all acute viral infections may actually involve the myocardium.
Myocarditis occurs in both pediatric and elderly populations, with a median age of 42 y.
Both men and women are affected equally.
Etiology
Infectious causes
Viral infections are the most common cause of pericarditis and myocarditis in developed countries.
In developing countries, tuberculosis is a significant cause of pericarditis and is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Other causes: Bacterial, fungal, protozoan, parasitic.
Non-infectious causes
Autoimmune, neoplastic, metabolic, toxicologic (ie, drug-related), and traumatic.
In Western Europe and North America, about 80-90% of cases are labeled idiopathic, even after diagnostic evaluation with sophisticated immunohistochemical and genomic studies. Most are presumed to be viral. 
Myocarditis is most commonly caused by a viral infection.
The most common type of myocarditis seen on a myocardial biopsy is lymphocytic myocarditis. The other distinct pathologic types of myocarditis are eosinophilic (associated with hypersensitivity reactions to medications and vaccines), giant cell (autoimmune disease), and rarely granulomatous (ie, sarcoidosis). 
Diagnostic Considerations
Criteria
Pericarditis
Acute pericarditis is a clinical diagnosis that is made with at least 2 of the following 4 criteria:
Classic chest pain (>85-90% of cases) typically described as sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward and worsened by lying back
Pericardial friction rub
Characteristic ECG abnormalities (discussed below)
New or worsening pericardial effusion
Myocarditis
A non-invasive diagnostic test for myocarditis does not currently exist. Hence, many cases are undetected because of subclinical/non-specific presentations or a missed diagnosis. In many cases of early patient presentation, a definitive diagnosis is not possible.
Acute myocarditis is usually a presumptive clinical diagnosis, as a definitive diagnosis requires established histological, immunological, and immunohistochemical criteria that require endomyocardial biopsy.
Patients with a distinct symptom onset (usually in the past 2 wk) and signs of severe heart failure, electrical instability, hypotension, or cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic or mechanical circulatory support are diagnosed with FM.
ECG abnormalities can be highly variable, including ST elevation or depression, supraventricular or ventricular dysrhythmias, and atrioventricular (AV) blocks. Sinus tachycardia is the most typical finding.
Myopericarditis vs. perimyocarditis.
Myopericarditis: A presentation consistent with acute pericarditis with known myocardial damage (increased troponin values) or suspected concomitant myocardial involvement but with maintained cardiac function.
Perimyocarditis: Evidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction in patients with positive troponins and clinical criteria for acute pericarditis suggests predominant myocarditis with pericardial involvement and should be referred to as perimyocarditis.
Clinical Presentation
Pericarditis
Patients typically present with rapid-onset substernal chest discomfort that is sharp and pleuritic.
Pain classically worsens with inspiration and is often positional, increasing when the patient is supine and decreasing when he/she is sitting or leaning forward.
Pain may radiate to the neck or jaw, and inflammation of the phrenic nerve may result in referred pain to the back and shoulders. 
Additional symptoms may include cough, rhinorrhea, a low-grade fever, and dyspnea.
Patients with an underlying malignancy or autoimmune disorder may present with non-specific signs and symptoms of their primary illness, such as fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, etc. 
Myocarditis
Often preceded by a viral prodrome of a fever, rash, sore throat, malaise, arthralgias, and non-specific gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms.
Patients can present with dyspnea, chest pain, and arrhythmias.
Myocarditis may present with unexpected sudden cardiac death, presumably due to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
Bradyarrhythmia and syncope due to a new-onset unexplained heart block may also occur in both infectious (ie, Lyme disease) and immune-mediated forms of myocarditis.
The clinical presentation of myocarditis may mimic ACS, but unlike with pericarditis, myocarditis will result in profound troponin elevation. Acute myocarditis in patients with underlying coronary artery disease often results in false-positive activation of the catheterization suite. 
Physical Examination
Friction Rub
A pericardial friction rub results from friction between the inflamed visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium, which produces a “squeaky or scratchy” high-pitched sound. It is best auscultated at the left sternal border at end expiration and when the patient is leaning forward or in the left lateral decubitus position. 
In contrast to a pleural rub, a pericardial friction rub is audible throughout the respiratory cycle. A pleural rub is absent when respirations are stopped.
Only a minority of patients with pericarditis have an audible rub at presentation. This rub tends to vary in intensity over time. Serial examinations are helpful. 
Despite the poor sensitivity of a pericardial friction rub, it remains a key diagnostic criterion. 
Cardiac Tamponade
Estimated to develop in about 15% of patients with idiopathic pericarditis.
Hypotension, jugular venous distention (JVD), and pulsus paradoxus (a decrease in systolic arterial pressure of more than 10 mm Hg with inspiration) are suggestive of cardiac tamponade.
Sinus tachycardia occurs in many patients as a physiologic response to help maintain cardiac output.
The Kaushal sign is an increase in jugular venous pressure during inspiration and can be seen in tamponade.
Patients with early or less severe myocarditis present non-specifically, making the physical examination less helpful in considering and establishing the diagnosis.
Unexplained, persistent, and clinically worrisome alterations in the patient’s examination, including vital signs, are frequent at this stage of their presentation. Examples include tachypnea, tachycardia, etc.
Patients with FM display hypotension, out-of-proportion tachycardia, fever, S3 gallop, JVD, and other signs of severe heart failure including pulmonary rales, wheezing, and respiratory failure.
ECG Abnormalities
The parietal pericardium is electrically inert and therefore does not cause ECG abnormalities. ECG changes seen in myopericardial syndromes are attributed to repolarization abnormalities of the atrial and ventricular myocardium in response to epicardial inflammation.  ECG ECG
Pericarditis
An estimated 90% of patients with acute pericarditis will have some ECG abnormality. 
Classic findings include a diffuse ST-segment elevation pattern without reciprocal ST-segment depression (excluding leads V1 and aVR) and widespread PR-segment depressions, but these are insensitive and seen in less than 60% of patients.  ECG
Classically, ECG changes in patients with acute pericarditis progress through 4 stages. However, patients do not necessarily present with stageable ECG abnormalities and may not progress from one stage to the next in an orderly fashion. ECG
Stage I: Diffuse ST-segment elevation that occurs in multiple leads (except for V1 and aVR) with diffuse PR-segment depression.
Stage II: The ST segment returns to baseline, and the T-wave flattens.
Stage III: The T-wave inverts, and there is potential ST-segment depression.
Stage IV: The ECG returns to normal over the course of weeks or months. 
It is critical to consider acute myocardial ischemia before concluding on a final diagnosis of pericarditis.
The temporal evolution of ECG changes with both entities is highly variable. Obtain serial ECGs.
The differential diagnosis of ST-segment elevation in adult patients with chest pain includes the following entities:
STEMI
Prinzmetal’s angina (coronary vasospasm)
Ventricular aneurysm
Early repolarization
Left bundle branch block
LV hypertrophy (by voltage) with a strain pattern
Ventricular paced rhythm pattern
ST segment
Unlike with ACS, which may have several different ST-segment morphologies, concave ST-segment elevation is typical of acute pericarditis.
Reciprocal ST-segment depressions favor STEMI but are not always present.
STEMI should be considered when the degree of ST elevation is greater in lead III than in lead II. Conversely the ST-segment elevation in pericarditis is typically greater in lead II than in lead III. 
PR segment
Represents the time from the onset of atrial depolarization to the onset of ventricular depolarization. Atrial myocardial inflammation causes exaggerated atrial repolarization that leads to PR depression.
PR-segment changes are not universally seen but can be most easily identified in the aVR lead.
PR-segment depression can also be seen in ACS (especially with atrial infarction) and as a normal variant.
Spodick published a study in 1974 that identified PR-segment depression in more than 80% of the ECGs of patients diagnosed with acute pericarditis. It has therefore been proposed that the PR segment can be used to support the diagnosis of acute pericarditis and may help to differentiate acute pericarditis from other causes of diffuse ST elevation.
PR depression is not a specific finding and is not pathognomonic of pericarditis (eg, a STEMI can also be associated with PR-segment depression in some leads). Clinicians should be cautious to avoid making the diagnosis based on this finding alone. 
Despite clinical characteristics that differentiate acute pericarditis from an acute myocardial infarction, approximately 15-20% of patients who present to the ED with pericarditis will undergo coronary angiography before the final diagnosis is made. 
Table for a comparison of the major ECG differences between STEMI, myopericarditis, and early repolarization.
ECG in pericardial effusion and tamponade.
Sinus tachycardia is a common finding and reflects a compensatory reaction to the decrease in preload and stroke volume from tamponade in an effort to preserve cardiac output.
A low-voltage QRS is seen in the setting of a large pericardial effusion and often precedes electrical alternans (alternation of the QRS complex amplitude or axis between beats). In the correct clinical setting, low-voltage QRS complexes in addition to sinus tachycardia should prompt emergency physicians to consider a pericardial effusion. ECG
Electrical alternans occurs when a large pericardial effusion is present and the heart swings back and forth, beat-to-beat, inside the distended, fluid-filled pericardial sac. ECG
Myocarditis
No ECG findings are specific to the diagnosis of myocarditis, and patients with myocarditis may have normal ECGs or non-specific abnormalities.
The ECG may be concerning for myocardial ischemia, including ST-segment elevation with reciprocal changes, ST depression, and T-wave inversion.
Other ECG findings include the following:
Sinus tachycardia (most common)
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias
High-grade AV block
Common in Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, and cases of giant cell myocarditis.
Wide QRS or pathologic Q waves
Associated with a worse prognosis 
Note that the ECG patterns of patients with myocarditis do not follow the classic description of pericarditis noted above. Patients with myocarditis can demonstrate ECG abnormalities that look exactly like those of a true STEMI.
Imaging Evaluation
Chest X-ray (CXR)
The cardiac silhouette does not increase in size until at least 300 mL of pericardial fluid has accumulated.
CXR appears normal in patients without a pericardial effusion or tamponade. 
Patients with myocarditis may display cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and/or pleural effusions.
Bedside Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)
TTE provides a simple, non-invasive assessment of the pericardium at the time of ED presentation. Image
While the presence of a pericardial effusion is common and supportive of the diagnosis of pericarditis, the absence of an effusion does not exclude this diagnosis.
EM:RAP Video and EM:RAP Video highlight some of the echocardiographic findings that may be seen in cases of complicated pericarditis.
Bedside echocardiography is especially helpful in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. For example, in patients with ST-segment elevation, regional wall motion abnormalities are strongly suggestive of STEMI.
Formal echocardiography or other imaging, such as coronary angiography, may be needed for further diagnostic clarity. 
Computed Tomography (CT)
CT may demonstrate a pericardial effusion but is not the diagnostic test of choice in pericarditis.
CT (and MRI) can evaluate the pericardium for thickening, which is more often seen in cases of chronic pericarditis with constriction.
The CT of patients ultimately diagnosed with a myopericardial disease is typically performed for another reason (ie, to assess for a significant pulmonary embolism).
Cardiac MRI
MRI may show thickening of the pericardium in cases of pericarditis.
Non-invasive imaging with a cardiac MRI can assist in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis and chronic dilated inflammatory cardiomyopathy.
Different patterns of myocardial damage distinguish ischemic from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Its utility is limited in the unstable and critically ill patient. 
Endomyocardial Biopsy (EMB)
Histology is the gold standard for the diagnosis of myocarditis.
The accuracy of EMB is limited by the etiology of the inflammation, as the patchy distribution of inflammatory infiltrates potentially limits the sensitivity of this invasive diagnostic tool. 
Recommendations for EMB in the setting of acute myocarditis are controversial and debatable. Except for heart transplant recipients, EMB is rarely performed in the U.S. Recent literature suggests that a histologic diagnosis can improve the time to diagnosis and provide prognostic information in cases of FM. 
EMB is not typically used in the setting of pericarditis but can be used for confirmation if the patient is admitted to the hospital for further evaluation on a select basis.
Coronary Angiography
Should be considered to rule out ACS, especially in those with common risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis, ECG findings suggestive of ACS, or wall motion abnormalities on U/S.
Laboratory Evaluation
Obtain labs, including a CBC, CMP, troponin, coagulation studies, and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).
Inflammatory markers are non-specific and are often elevated in patients with myocarditis.
Order a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-proBNP if acute heart failure is suspected.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment should focus on the following:
Cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic complications
Cardiogenic shock related to myocarditis
Symptomatic relief of pericardial pain
Treatment of tamponade physiology
Perform a pericardiocentesis to rapidly remove fluid from the pericardial space. This procedure is best performed in a cardiac catheter laboratory with fluoroscopic and echocardiographic assistance. In the emergency setting, a pericardiocentesis can be performed at the bedside using a landmark-based approach or under bedside echocardiographic guidance (time permitting).
Even a small amount of pericardial fluid that accumulates rapidly may create a tamponade physiology. In these situations, an U/S is helpful to reduce the iatrogenic risk associated with an emergency pericardiocentesis. In less critical or time-sensitive settings or if the effusion recurs, surgical evacuation should be pursued. Creation of a pericardial window is effective for removing acute fluid collections and preventing their recurrence. 
Treatment of cardiogenic shock related to myocarditis
Immediate treatment includes aggressive resuscitation with IV crystalloids, respiratory support, and vasopressors and inotropes as needed.
Management of arrhythmias associated with myocarditis is provided with conventional therapy.
A ventricular assist device and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can act as a bridge to transplantation or recovery in critically ill patients who do not improve with optimal medical management. 
Other therapeutic considerations.
Animal models show an increased risk of mortality with the use of NSAIDs. 
IV immunoglobulin is not recommended. 
Giant cell myocarditis can be treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.
Acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis, a rare but rapidly progressive severe form of myocarditis, also requires treatment with corticosteroids. 
ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers such as carvedilol and metoprolol, and diuretics as needed are part of the medical management of myocarditis after stabilization.
Symptomatic treatment of pericarditis.
Pericarditis is treated with NSAIDs.
Ibuprofen (800-1600 mg daily) and IV ketorolac have replaced the once commonly prescribed indomethacin. 
Combination therapy with colchicine is considered first-line therapy for preventing the recurrence of non-bacterial pericarditis.
Colchicine must be continued for at least 6 mo to effectively prevent recurrence. 
Recurrent pericarditis is treated with a repeat course of NSAIDs. Table
Steroids.
Not recommended for ED use as they are associated with an increased risk of recurrence. 
Reserve for patients who do not tolerate NSAIDs or have contraindications to their use, only after the failure of first-line therapy.
Rarely used in the treatment of intractable pain. 
Pericardiectomy is a final option for experienced surgical centers after the failure of medical therapies. 
Disposition
Pericarditis
Most patients with acute pericarditis do not need to be admitted to the hospital.
Some admitted patients may have been initially diagnosed with ACS or undifferentiated chest pain.
Risk-stratify patients to determine disposition:
Hypotensive patients require admission.
Pericarditis from an underlying causative process or with at least one high-risk feature associated with a poor prognosis warrants hospitalization. These features include the following:
Fever (>38 °C).
A subacute course (symptoms over several days without a clear acute onset).
Evidence of a large pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade.
Failure to respond to treatment with NSAIDs after 7 d.
Stable patients with intractable pain may be admitted or placed in an observation unit.
Stable patients without high-risk features can be managed as outpatients with empiric treatment with anti-inflammatory medication and short-term follow-up (1 wk) to assess treatment response.
Discharged patients should receive clearly outlined indications for returning to the ED.
Myocarditis
Admit all patients to a monitored bed.
Hemodynamically unstable patients require admission to the ICU.
Many admitted patients are initially admitted due to continued, unexplained clinical issues of significance. Thus, the diagnosis of myocarditis is initially not suspected and most certainly not established.
Prognosis
Pericarditis
Most patients with acute pericarditis (commonly those with presumed viral or idiopathic causes) have a good long-term prognosis. Cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis rarely occur in these patients and are more common in those with specific underlying causes, such as a malignancy. Constrictive pericarditis is more likely to occur due to autoimmune, immune-mediated, and neoplastic causes (2-5%) and is highly likely in bacterial cases (20%-30%), especially with tuberculosis and purulent pericarditis. 
Approximately 15-30% of patients with idiopathic acute pericarditis who are not treated with colchicine develop either recurrent or incessant disease. Colchicine may significantly reduce the recurrence rate of pericarditis.  Patients with significant myocardial inflammation and involvement have the potential for a higher rate of complications, including LV dysfunction and heart failure. 
Myocarditis
Patients with myocarditis follow a variable course, and the overall prognosis is therefore difficult to determine at the time of presentation.
The vast majority of patients recover several weeks to months after their presentation. 
In a recent multicenter study, 3.2% of patients with acute myocarditis suffered cardiac death or required a heart transplant during their hospitalization (4.1% at 5-y follow-up). 
Patients with acute complicated myocarditis (defined as an LV ejection fraction of <50%, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, low cardiac output syndrome requiring the use of inotrope and/or mechanical circulatory support) are at an increased risk of adverse cardiac events compared with patients with uncomplicated myocarditis (lacking the above features). 
When the LV ejection fraction at the first cardiac magnetic resonance is preserved, the risk of developing an inflammatory cardiomyopathy is very low. 
Eosinophilic and giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis generally have worse outcomes.",Acute Myopericardial Syndromes
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
When aortic dissection (AD) is suspected, immediate CT angiography of the aorta is indicated unless there is a compelling contraindication.
Consider early emergency surgical consultation or transfer to a facility with an appropriate vascular specialist.
Hemodynamic goals:
Heart rate (HR) <60 beats/min.
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) <120 mm Hg.
Consider an arterial line for accurate titration of antihypertensive agents.
In the event of blood pressure discrepancy among extremities, dose the antihypertensive medication based on the extremity with the higher SBP.
Upon confirmation of dissection, initiate pharmacologic measures to reduce the pulse pressure:
2-drug strategy: First, β-blockade; second, antihypertensive agent
β-blockade
Esmolol IV is preferred if rapidly available for its titratability given as 500 μg/kg bolus over 1 min followed by 50 μg/kg/min continuous infusion; may titrate up by 25-50 μg/kg/min every 5-15 min to a max of 300 μg/kg/min.
Antihypertensive agent
Nicardipine IV 5 mg/h; may titrate up by 2.5 mg/h every 5-15 min to a max of 15 mg/h, or
Clevidipine IV initial dose 1-2 mg/h IV infusion, titrate up by doubling the dose at 90-s intervals initially; once approaching target blood pressure, increase by less than double dose and lengthen dose interval to 5-10 min, to a max of 32 mg/h, or
Sodium nitroprusside IV 0.3 μg/kg/min, titrate up by 0.5 μg/kg/min every 5 min to a maximum of 10 μg/kg/min for a max duration of 10 min, or
Fenoldopam IV 0.001-0.03 μg/kg/min, titrate up by 0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min every 15 min to a max of 1.6 μg/kg/min.
1-drug strategy
Labetalol IV 10-20 mg bolus over 2 min, then 20-80 mg bolus every 10-15 min to a max of 300 mg, or initiate labetalol continuous infusion at 0.5-2 mg/min, titrate up by 0.5 mg/min every 10 min to a max of 10 mg/min.
Note: Labetalol IV has 7 times more beta blocker activity than alpha blocker activity; therefore, labetalol is often inadequate for blood pressure control.
If sudden cardiac arrest occurs, consider point-of-care U/S to evaluate for pericardial effusion with tamponade and/or hemothorax.
The temporary return of spontaneous circulation may occur following successful pericardiocentesis.
Key Concepts
Acute aortic disorders include aortic dissections (AD), aortic aneurysms (AA), intramural hematomas, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers, and injuries sustained by trauma (transection, penetrating injury). This chapter focuses primarily on aortic dissections. Traumatic aortic injuries are covered in another chapter. (See Chapter: Blunt Thoracic Trauma) (See Chapter: Penetrating Thoracic Trauma)
The aortic wall is composed of 3 contiguous tissue layers in sequence from the vessel lumen moving outward: intima, media, adventitia.
AD represents a failure of the aortic intima, leading to propagation of dissection at the aortic media due to the patient’s pulse pressure. The passage of blood into this space can extend the tear and create a false lumen, ultimately compromising perfusion at branch vessels or causing rupture.
Outcomes for patients with acute aortic disorders are heavily dependent on timely diagnosis and intervention, whether surgical or medical.
AD is rare and difficult to diagnose due to the non-specific presentation of symptoms. In as many as one-third of patients, AD is not diagnosed upon initial presentation, but instead is most often mistaken for an acute coronary syndrome. Unfortunately, AD also carries high mortality, especially when the diagnosis is delayed.
The presentation of AD can mimic a variety of other conditions including pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, refractory shock, hypertensive emergency, abdominal catastrophe, or acute limb ischemia.
Mortality from AD occurs via 4 pathways:
Acute cardiac tamponade - Intrapericardial rupture of the ascending AD.
Acute aortic insufficiency - Unseating of the aortic valve can produce immediate cardiogenic shock, in contrast with chronic aortic insufficiency, which is tolerated hemodynamically to a greater extent.
Aortic free rupture - Usually into the left pleural space.
End-organ ischemia - Any organ can be affected.
AD is classically categorized by the Stanford system: Figure Figure
Type A dissection - Involves the ascending aorta.
Type B dissection - Involves the descending aorta only, effectively distal to the left subclavian artery.
An alternative classification is the DeBakey system:
Type I dissection - Origin in the ascending aorta, through the aortic arch, and continuing into the descending or abdominal aorta.
Type II dissection - Origin in the ascending aorta but does not extend into the descending aorta.
Type IIIa dissection - Origin in the descending aorta but does not extend into the abdominal aorta.
Type IIIb dissection - Origin in the descending aorta and continuing into the abdominal aorta.
Ascending dissection requires urgent surgery in most cases (Stanford Type A and DeBakey Types I and II).
Descending dissection is usually treated medically (Stanford Type B and DeBakey Types IIIa and IIIb).
However, if the descending dissection compromises a major branch vessel (eg, superior mesenteric artery, renal artery, iliac artery), then surgery is typically required.
Exceptions exist for major therapeutic strategies across all AD.
AD can take any of the following 3 basic morphologies:
Typical AD - Splitting of 2 layers as described above.
Penetrating aortic ulcer - Atherosclerotic ulceration of the aortic wall through the elastic lamina (which separates the intima and media) and into the media, permits the entry of blood between the layers, potentially leading to hematoma or eventual aortic wall rupture.
Intramural hematoma - Crescentic layer of blood forms spontaneously in the aortic wall, without frank separation of layers or an intimal flap. Prognosis and location mimic dissection and, while controversial, most recommend similar management to dissection based on anatomic location.
CT angiography of the aorta is the preferred diagnostic study in the ED but does not formally evaluate for the presence or absence of valve competence (ie, aortic valve insufficiency). EM:RAP Video
Bedside echocardiography is an important diagnostic tool in the unstable patient.
ED treatment consists of reducing the pulse pressure-related shear force (Δp/Δt) through pharmacologic rate control followed by blood pressure control. This goal should be addressed along with emergency surgical consultation, with or without interfacility transfer as dictated by local surgical ability.
Key Diagnostic Elements
The most common presenting symptom of AD is pain. Pain is classically described as sudden in onset and severe. However, this description is not universal; some patients may also present with a more gradual onset of mild pain that is similar in description to musculoskeletal ailments of the thorax, back, or groin.
As many as 10% of patients present without any pain at all. Cases of painless AD have been reported, although they are usually accompanied by other findings and are more likely to present with neurologic symptoms; thus, a true painless dissection likely does not exist.
Painful AD may be described as severe. The pain originates and is maximal under the sternum in ascending dissection. The pain from descending dissection often originates between the shoulder blades or the upper thoracic back and may migrate distally toward the abdomen and legs.
Chest pain associated with AD is more commonly described as sharp and not the classic description of tearing or ripping. Tearing or migrating pain is estimated to be present in only 30%-40% of cases. 
Consider AD for any pain above and below the diaphragm, and chest or abdominal pain with neurologic signs or symptoms including syncope.
Important patient history clues suggestive of increased risk for AD include:
Bicuspid aortic valve
Connective tissue disease (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz disease).
Uncontrolled hypertension
Cocaine abuse
Pregnancy
Thoracic trauma
Aortic coarctation
Iatrogenic (eg, cardiac catheterization, aortic valve replacement).
Family history of AA, bicuspid aortic valve, dissection, or sudden cardiac death should raise suspicion.
Physical Examination
Physical examination may be completely normal upon presentation.
Examination findings classically associated with thoracic AD are present in less than one-third of all cases.
~40% of patients with a dissection will demonstrate an aortic insufficiency/regurgitant murmur, reflecting unseating of the aortic valve by an ascending AD. This murmur can be quite subtle and difficult to detect.
Patients can present in shock, suggesting hemorrhage from ruptured AD causing internal bleeding or intrapericardial rupture causing cardiac tamponade.
Syncope or prolonged unconsciousness can be the initial presentation of patients with cardiac tamponade. Jugular vein distention, pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds, and grayish discoloration of the face may be seen in these patients.
Pulse and blood pressure considerations:
Pulse deficits or focal neurological deficits significantly increase the likelihood of AD in the appropriate clinical setting.
30% of patients with a Stanford Type A dissection and 15% with a Type B dissection will demonstrate a pulse deficit.
There may be absent or diminished pulses in the carotid, brachial, and/or femoral arteries.
A difference in blood pressure between the two arms of at least 20 mm Hg suggests involvement of aortic branch arteries.
Death, syncope, or hemiplegia may occur after occlusion of one or both carotid arteries. AD may present as stroke-like symptoms in 4.7% of cases. 
Anuria may be present secondary to disturbed renal perfusion.
Paraplegia or quadriplegia may be present secondary to occlusion of the vessels feeding the anterior spinal arteries.
The physical stigmata seen in connective tissue disease may be observed (refer to Deep Dive: Aortic Dissection for detailed discussion of such physical examination findings).
The presence of the following positive findings was found to increase the probability of AD: 
Tearing or ripping pain
Migrating pain
Sudden-onset chest pain
Focal neurological deficits
Pulse deficit
The presence of the following negative findings was found to decrease the probability of AD: 
Absence of sudden-onset chest pain
Pain not described as tearing or ripping
CXR without large aorta or wide mediastinum
Most clinical findings associated with AD are insensitive in isolation. However, a combination of findings increases the accuracy of the clinical assessment for AD.
Laboratory Evaluation
Routine hematologic investigations are likely of limited utility in establishing the diagnosis of AD. However, such investigations (eg, acute renal failure, acute hepatitis secondary to ischemia, or lactic acidosis associated with hypoperfusion) may be helpful in establishing the severity of the patient’s dissection.
A type and screen with crossmatch is essential for operative management and should be collected in the ED.
Caution: Do not rely on the D-dimer assay alone to exclude a diagnosis of acute AD due to the limited evidence of its accuracy (ACEP Clinical Guidelines, Level C).
As many as 18% of AD patients exhibit an elevated troponin. Chest pain with an elevated troponin does not reliably exclude AD.
Imaging Tests
The classically described CXR abnormalities associated with AD are not reliably present; furthermore, such abnormalities are non-specific and inadequate for either ruling in or ruling out AD.
CT angiography is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of AD, given its speed, availability, high sensitivity and specificity, and the wealth of information provided by CT angiograms. Image Image
CT angiography of the aorta is reported to have a sensitivity of nearly 100% and a specificity of 100% for acute AD.
ACEP Clinical Guidelines support the use of CT angiography of the aorta as equivalent in diagnostic accuracy to transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or magnetic resonance angiography (ACEP Clinical Guidelines, Level B recommendation).
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) Image is insufficient for the definitive diagnosis of thoracic AD due to its inherent insensitivity. TTE is insensitive because of its limited ability to visualize the aortic arch and descending aorta. In addition, the patient’s body habitus can limit the imaging ability.
ACEP Clinical Guidelines recommend not relying on an abnormal bedside TTE for the definitive diagnosis of thoracic AD (ACEP Clinical Guidelines, Level B). However, the guidelines do provide a consensus recommendation that if an AD is identified on limited bedside U/S, then surgical consultation and/or transfer to a higher level of care capable of definitively managing AD should occur (ACEP Clinical Guidelines, Level C).
TEE can be considered to establish the diagnosis of AD. However, TEE requires specialized equipment, clinicians, and sedation, which may prevent a timely diagnostic study. Thus, TEE is not recommended as an initial imaging study in the ED. The sensitivity of TEE is between 86% and 100% with a specificity of 90% to 100%.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the aorta has a high sensitivity (95%-100%) and high specificity (94%-98%) for thoracic AD. However, MRA is a specialized exam with limited availability as well as longer image acquisition time, which could delay diagnosis.
Treatment
Ensure that the patient is NPO, then obtain large-bore IV access (consider arterial line placement).
Provide adequate analgesia with opiates, if the patient’s hemodynamic status allows.
If the patient is hypertensive and/or tachycardic, rapidly reduce HR to 60 beats per minute or lower with β-blockade, then target SBP <120 mm Hg by using an antihypertensive agent:
2-drug strategy: First, β-blockade; second, antihypertensive agent.
β-blockade
Esmolol IV is preferred if rapidly available for its titratability given as 500 μg/kg bolus over 1 min followed by 50 μg/kg/min continuous infusion; may titrate up by 25-50 μg/kg/min every 5-15 min to a max of 300 μg/kg/min then
Antihypertensive agent
Nicardipine IV 5 mg/h; may titrate up by 2.5 mg/h every 5-15 min to a max of 15 mg/h, or
Clevidipine IV initial dose 1-2 mg/h IV infusion, titrate up by doubling the dose at 90-s intervals initially; once approaching target blood pressure, increase by less than double dose and lengthen dose interval to 5-10 min, to a max of 32 mg/h, or
Sodium nitroprusside IV 0.3 μg/kg/min, titrate up by 0.5 μg/kg/min every 5 min to a maximum of 10 μg/kg/min for a max duration of 10 min, or
Fenoldopam IV 0.001-0.03 μg/kg/min, titrate up by 0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min every 15 min to a max of 1.6 μg/kg/min.
1-drug strategy:
Labetalol IV 10-20 mg bolus over 2 min, then 20-80 mg bolus every 10 to 15 min to a max of 300 mg, or initiate labetalol continuous infusion at 0.5-2 mg/min, titrate up by 0.5 mg/min every 10 min to a max of 10 mg/min.
If the use of a β-blockade is contraindicated secondary to bronchospasm, then consider a calcium channel blocker.
Diltiazem IV 0.25 mg/kg bolus over 2 min, then start continuous infusion at 5 mg/h, titrating up by 5 mg/h every 30 min to a max of 15 mg/h.
Immediate surgical consultation should occur for all ADs, regardless of location.
Stanford Type A AD, or Type B with evidence of limb or end-organ ischemia, requires immediate operative intervention.
Type B AD may be managed medically in the absence of end-organ ischemia or limb ischemia.
Disposition
A patient with acute AD is typically not discharged home unless the goals of care are inconsistent with operative treatment or medical management.
Anticipate patient transfer to the OR with cardiothoracic or vascular surgery, or transfer the patient to a facility with access to these subspecialties.
All patients with acute AD who are receiving IV medications require ICU admission.
If transfer is required for management, the most expeditious means is encouraged (ie, air versus ground) based on availability, distance, local travel issues, weather, and so on.
Charting Pearls
AD is a time-dependent disease. Note the key time intervals and interventions:
Time from the onset of symptoms
Time to order, perform, receive, and interpret imaging
Time to order and initiate blood pressure control
Time to receive surgical or radiology consultation
Time to request emergency transfer; time to initiate emergency transfer",Aortic Dissection

Background
Epidemiology
AD is estimated to occur in 2.9 to 3.5 per 100,000 patients per year. 
The mean age of onset for AD is 63 y of age. 
Two-thirds of ADs occur in males. 
In individuals less than 40 y of age, 59% of ADs are associated with either Marfan syndrome or bicuspid aortic valve. 
Risk factors associated with AD include 
Hypertension (76%)
Atherosclerosis (27%)
AA (16%)
Previous cardiac surgery (16%)
Marfan syndrome (5%)
Iatrogenic injury (4%)
Cocaine use (1.8%)
In women of childbearing age, pregnancy imparts a 4-fold increased risk of AD compared with non-pregnant females, with an estimated risk of 5.5 per 1,000,000 versus 1.7 per 1,000,000. 
Similar to larger registry data, individuals with hypertension and/or connective tissue diseases are more likely to develop an acute AD. 
AD more frequently occurs between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m., peaking at 9 a.m., and during the winter months, with a peak in January. 
Mortality considerations:
The in-hospital overall mortality for Stanford Type A dissections is estimated to be 22% and for Stanford Type B dissections is 14%. 
AD mortality is estimated to increase by 1% to 2% per hour following the onset of symptoms. 
Mortality is higher for patients presenting with painless acute AD. These patients are also more likely to present with neurologic symptoms. 
The factors that increase in-hospital mortality include shock, refractory hypertension, recurrent pain, mesenteric malperfusion, pericardial tamponade, and periaortic hematoma. Other factors include an age greater than 70 y, migrating pain, ischemic changes on ECG, and the presence of pulse deficit. 
Pathophysiology
The aorta is histologically composed of 3 predominant layers: the tunica intima (innermost), tunica media, and tunica adventitia (outermost).
The tunica media gives the aorta its elasticity.
Normal aging leads to medial degeneration of the aorta, with hypertension accelerating this process.
AD typically occurs when the integrity of the tunica intima is disrupted, allowing pulsatile blood to dissect through the tunica media, leading to the creation of a false lumen.
The pulsatile aortic flow propagates the dissection, typically in an antegrade fashion, from the intimal tear.
Fenestrations between the true lumen and false lumen can occur downstream from the initial intimal defect, typically near the ostia of vessels branching off the aorta, maintaining false lumen patency. 
Areas of repeated mechanical stress associated with the cardiac cycle as well as higher hydrodynamic forces, such as the ascending aorta and first portion of the descending thoracic aorta, are at increased risk of AD. 
Two widely accepted classification systems exist for ADs Figure:
Stanford System - Classified by the proximal site of the dissection alone: 
Type A dissections involve the ascending aorta.
Type B dissections involve the descending aorta, effectively distal to the left subclavian artery.
DeBakey System - Classified by both the proximal site of the dissection as well as the distal extent of the dissection: 
Type I Dissection - Origin in the ascending aorta, through the aortic arch, continuing into the descending or abdominal aorta.
Type II Dissection - Origin in the ascending aorta, does not extend into the descending aorta.
Type IIIa Dissection - Origin in the descending aorta, does not extend into the abdominal aorta.
Type IIIb Dissection - Origin in the descending aorta, extends into the abdominal aorta.
67% of ADs are Stanford Type A with 33% being Stanford Type B. 
Congenital anomalies of the aortic valve increase the probability of AD: 
Bicuspid aortic valves are found in approximately 1% to 2% of the general population; however, bicuspid aortic valves are found in approximately 9% to 13% of patients with AD.
A bicuspid aortic valve potentially reorients the normal laminar flow toward the wall of the aorta, producing local injury and making the wall more susceptible to ascending dissection.
Mortality from AD is typically associated with the complications associated with dissection formation: 
Acute cardiac tamponade (intrapericardial rupture of ascending AD).
Acute aortic insufficiency (unseating of aortic valve can produce immediate cardiogenic shock as opposed to better-tolerated chronic aortic insufficiency).
Aortic free rupture (usually into the left pleural space).
End-organ ischemia (any organ can be affected).
Cardiac tamponade occurs in 18.7% of patients with AD and is an extremely poor prognostic indicator.
In-hospital mortality associated with tamponade secondary to AD is 54% versus 24.6% for those without tamponade. 
Acute aortic insufficiency occurs in as many as 32% of patients and is more common in patients with Stanford Type A dissections. 
Free rupture of the aorta is reported to occur in approximately 18% of ADs and can lead to rapid exsanguination and death. 
End-organ ischemia/malperfusion syndromes occur in roughly one-third of patients with AD and are driven by two major processes: 
A branch vessel off the aorta remains fed by the true lumen, although narrowing of the ostium secondary to the hydrostatic pressure of the false lumen leads to impaired flow and thrombosis of the branch vessel.
A branch vessel off the aorta is fed by the false lumen, while the dissection extends into the branch vessel, leading to impaired perfusion.
Hypoperfusion of the mesentery secondary to AD is relatively rare, yet imparts significant mortality risk to the patient.
Mesenteric ischemia is found in approximately 3.7% of patients with a Stanford Type A dissection, with an overall in-hospital mortality of 63.2% versus 23.8% in those without mesenteric ischemia. 
Mesenteric ischemia is found in approximately 7.1% of patients with a Stanford Type B dissection with an overall in-hospital mortality of 30.8% versus 9.1% in those without mesenteric ischemia. 
Myocardial infarction is rare but reported in as many as 3% of cases of AD, typically presenting as an inferior or posterior myocardial infarction secondary to involvement of the right coronary artery. 
Acute limb ischemia is commonly reported with AD, with one study reporting rates of approximately 2.5% for upper limb ischemia and 11.7% for lower limb ischemia. 
Approximately 6% of individuals presenting with a Stanford Type A AD present with clinical evidence of stroke. 
A distinct subtype of aortic pathology relevant to AD is the formation of an intramural hematoma without an identifiable dissection flap. Intramural hematomas can reabsorb, progress to aneurysm formation, or lead to dissection. Intramural hematomas in the ascending aorta have mortality rates that mimic ascending AD. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
AD is a challenging diagnosis and is missed upon initial presentation in as many as one-third of patients. AD is most often mistaken for an acute coronary syndrome. 
The presentation of AD can mimic several other conditions including pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, refractory shock, hypertensive emergency, abdominal catastrophe, or acute limb ischemia.
The most common presenting symptom of AD is pain. 
The pain associated with AD is classically described as sudden in onset and severe. Registry studies report that 95.5% of individuals with AD report pain, with 84.8% of all individuals with AD describing an abrupt onset of pain; 90.6% of the individuals studied reported their pain as “severe or worst ever.” Only 50.6% of the individuals described a “tearing or ripping pain,” with 64.4% reporting a sharp pain. 
This description of pain is not universal, because patients may also present with a more gradual onset of mild pain that is similar in description to musculoskeletal ailments of the thorax, back, or groin. 
Cases of painless AD have been reported, with registry studies suggesting that 5% to 10% of patients present without any pain at all.  Typically, these presentations of AD are confounded by neurologic symptoms, including altered mentation.  Thus, a true “painless” AD is questioned and likely does not occur.
The location of the pain may suggest the location of the dissection. 
In ascending dissection, the pain is thought to originate and be maximal at the anterior chest just under the sternum.
In descending dissection, the pain is thought to originate between the shoulder blades in the upper thoracic back, and may migrate distally toward the abdomen and legs.
The pain typically changes as the dissection extends or evolves.
The pain is often said to be preceded by either acute physical exertion or an acute emotional event.
Chest pain associated with AD is more likely to be described as sharp than the classically taught tearing or ripping sensation.  Tearing or migrating pain is present in approximately 30%-40% of patients, based on one study. 
It is important to consider AD for any pain above and below the diaphragm and for chest or abdominal pain with neurologic signs or symptoms, including syncope.
Important historical clues suggestive of increased risk for AD include the presence of
Bicuspid aortic valve
Connective tissue disease (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz disease)
Uncontrolled hypertension
Cocaine abuse
Pregnancy
Thoracic trauma
Aortic coarctation
Iatrogenic (eg, cardiac catheterization, aortic valve replacement).
A family history of AA, bicuspid aortic valve, dissection, or sudden cardiac death should raise suspicion.
Physical Examination
The physical examination may be completely normal upon presentation. The exam findings classically associated with thoracic AD are present in less than one-third of all cases. 
Approximately 40% of patients with a dissection demonstrate an aortic insufficiency/regurgitant murmur, reflecting unseating of the aortic valve by an ascending AD. 
Patients may present in shock, suggesting hemorrhage from a ruptured AD that is causing internal bleeding or intrapericardial rupture leading to cardiac tamponade. Jugular vein disorder, pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds, and grayish discoloration of the face may be seen in a patient with cardiac tamponade. 
Either syncope or prolonged unconsciousness can be the initial presentation of patients with cardiac tamponade.
30% of patients with a Stanford Type A dissection and 15% with a Type B dissection demonstrate a pulse deficit.  There may be absent or diminished pulses in the carotid, brachial, and femoral arteries. A difference in blood pressure between the two arms of at least 20 mm Hg may be found when there is involvement of aortic branch arteries.  However, the finding of unequal blood pressures is non-specific.
Pulse deficits (likelihood ratio [LR]+, 5.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-23) or focal neurological deficits (LR+, 6.6-33) significantly increase the likelihood of AD in the appropriate clinical setting.
Death, syncope, or hemiplegia may occur after occlusion of one or both carotid arteries. AD may present as stroke-like symptoms in 4.7% of cases. 
Blood pressure at presentation is variable with 49% of individuals being hypertensive (SBP ≥150 mm Hg), 34.6% normotensive, 8.0% hypotensive (<100 mm Hg), and 8.0% in frank shock (SBP ≤80 mm Hg). 
Acute myocardial infarction, including ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), occurs after occlusion or dissection into coronary arteries (most commonly, the right coronary artery).
Inferior STEMI is the most common presentation.
Anuria occurs, after disturbed renal perfusion.
Paraplegia or quadriplegia can result after the occlusion of vessels feeding the anterior spinal arteries.
The physical stigmata seen in connective tissue diseases include
Tall, thin body, long digits, suggestive of Marfan and non-Marfanoid connective tissue disease.
Pectus excavatum or carinatum.
Thumb-palm sign - Thumb stretches beyond medial border of the flat palm of the hand, indicating excessively long bones and lax joints.
Steinberg sign (thumb sign) - Tip of the thumb is visible medial to the little finger when the hand is clasped in a clenched fist.
Hypermobility or “double jointedness,” suggestive of lax connective tissue.
Despite a large number of case studies in AD, the clinical examination has yet to be prospectively evaluated in an independent and blinded study.
The available data allow the sensitivity of clinical history, physical examination, and chest radiography to be estimated, although likely overestimating the accuracy of these diagnostic methods through selection bias of more obvious cases. A small number of studies estimate the specificity of components of the clinical exam but remain limited by the lack of independence between the selection of patients for study and clinical findings. 
The presence of the following positive findings was found to increase the probability of AD (LR+; 95% confidence limits [CL]): 
Tearing or ripping pain (10.8; 5.2-22.0)
Migrating pain (7.6; 3.6-16.0)
Sudden-onset chest pain (2.6; 2.0-3.5)
Focal neurological deficits (33; 6.6-33.0)
Pulse deficit (5.7; 1.4-23.0)
The presence of the following negative findings was found to decrease the probability of AD (LR−; 95% CL): 
Sudden onset chest pain (0.3; 0.2-0.4)
Absence of pain description as tearing or ripping (0.4; 0.3-0.5)
CXR without large aorta or wide mediastinum (0.13; 0.02-1.00)
Most of the clinical findings associated with AD are insensitive in isolation. However, a combination of findings significantly increases the accuracy of clinical assessment for AD.
Hemodynamic presentation is variable, with 49.0% of patients being hypertensive, 34.6% normotensive, 8.0% hypotensive, and 8.4% in frank shock. 
Radiographic Evaluation
The classically described CXR abnormalities associated with AD are not reliably present, in addition to being non-specific and inadequate for ruling in or ruling out AD. 
CXR may be useful to exclude other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain such as pneumothorax.
A majority of patients with AD have abnormal CXR findings, so that a completely normal CXR result helps to decrease the likelihood of the disease (LR−, 0.3; 95% CL, 0.2-0.4). 
However, 12.4% of cases of thoracic AD are reported to have a normal CXR. 
The classically taught CXR Image abnormalities are:
Widening of the mediastinum (61.6% of cases)
Widening of the aortic knob or abnormal contour (49.6% of cases)
Unilateral or bilateral pleural effusions (19.2% of cases)
The calcium sign - Separation of an intimal calcification from the outer border of the aortic knob by 1 cm or more (14.1% of cases).
Absence of these classically taught CXR abnormalities may decrease the probability of disease.
ECG findings ECG ECG consistent with acute myocardial infarction, including STEMI, do not rule out AD. AD patients may have a normal ECG or their ECG could show the following:
Non-specific ST-segment and T wave abnormalities
ST-segment deviations, including elevation and depression
New Q waves
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Atrial fibrillation or other tachydysrhythmia
CT angiography Image is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of AD, given its speed, availability, high sensitivity and specificity, and the wealth of information provided by its study. 
CT angiography of the aorta is reported to have a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% for acute AD. 
The ACEP Clinical Guidelines support the use of CT angiography of the aorta as equivalent in diagnostic accuracy to TEE or MRA with a Level B recommendation. 
Cardiology-based TTE is typically regarded as having insufficient sensitivity (73.7% to 100%, median 86.9%) or specificity (71.2% to 91.0%, median 81.1%) for making a definitive diagnosis of thoracic AD. 
TTE is insensitive due to limitations in visualizing the aortic arch and descending aorta, as well as the potential for the patient’s body habitus to limit imaging.
The ACEP Clinical Guidelines have given a Level B recommendation to not rely on an abnormal bedside TTE for a definitive diagnosis of thoracic AD.
The ACEP Clinical Guidelines provide a Level C consensus recommendation that if an AD is identified upon limited bedside U/S, surgical consultation and/or transfer to a higher level of care capable of definitively managing AD should occur. 
TEE can be considered to establish the diagnosis of AD. However, TEE requires specialized equipment, clinicians, and sedation, which may prevent a timely diagnostic study.
The sensitivity of TEE is between 86% and 100% with a specificity of 90% to 100%. 
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the aorta has a high sensitivity (95%-100%) and high specificity (94%-98%) for thoracic AD. However, MRA of the aorta is a specialized exam with limited availability as well as a longer image acquisition time, which could delay diagnosis. 
MRA may be of higher utility for monitoring patients who are not undergoing operative management or patients in the postoperative surveillance period. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Routine hematologic investigations are likely of limited utility in establishing the diagnosis of AD. However, such investigations may be helpful in establishing the severity of the patient’s dissection in specific cases, such as acute renal failure, acute hepatitis secondary to ischemia, or lactic acidosis associated with hypoperfusion.
A type and screen with crossmatch is essential for operative management and should be collected in the ED.
Efforts continue to identify laboratory investigations that can help to rapidly identify individuals with AD.
Particular interest has been placed on the serum D-dimer, which, when <500 ng/mL within 24 h of symptom onset, has demonstrated a negative LR of 0.07 for AD. 
Unfortunately, detectable serum D-dimer levels are significantly less common if a dissection flap does not exist and intramural hematoma is the only pathologic finding upon imaging.
Because outcomes are similar between classic AD and intramural hematoma, the reduced specificity for intramural hematoma variants is of concern; as such, D-dimer testing to rule out AD does not meet the current standard of care.
The ACEP Clinical Guidelines have issued a Level C recommendation cautioning physicians not to rely on the D-dimer assay alone to exclude a diagnosis of acute AD. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Timely operative intervention in AD is key, because mortality is estimated to increase by 1% to 2% per hour following the onset of symptoms. 
After the diagnosis of AD in the ED, effort should be made to control the patient’s HR, followed by SBP, to reduce stress on the aortic intima.
Following adequate analgesia, a Class I recommendation based on expert consensus is to initiate intravenous β-blockade and titrate to an HR of 60 beats per minute or less.
If the SBP remains >120 mm Hg following the initiation of β-blockade, an intravenous vasodilatory agent should be initiated to reduce the SBP to <120 mm Hg while maintaining adequate end-organ perfusion. 
2-drug strategy: First, β-blockade; second, antihypertensive agent.
β-blockade
Esmolol IV is preferred if rapidly available for its titratability given as 500 μg/kg bolus over 1 min followed by 50 μg/kg/min continuous infusion; may titrate up by 25-50 μg/kg/min every 5-15 min to a max of 300 μg/kg/min, then
Antihypertensive agent
Nicardipine IV 5 mg/h; may titrate up by 2.5 mg/h every 5-15 min to a max of 15 mg/h, or
Clevidipine IV initial dose 1-2 mg/h IV infusion, titrate up by doubling the dose at 90-s intervals initially; once approaching target blood pressure, increase by less than double dose and lengthen dose interval to 5-10 min, to a max of 32 mg/h or
Sodium nitroprusside IV 0.3 μg/kg/min; may titrate up by 0.5 μg/kg/min every 5 min to a max of 10 μg/kg/min for a max duration of 10 min, or
Fenoldopam IV 0.001-0.03 μg/kg/min; may titrate up by 0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min every 15 min to a max of 1.6 μg/kg/min.
1-drug strategy:
Labetalol IV 10-20 mg bolus over 2 min, then 20-80 mg bolus every 10 to 15 min to a max of 300 mg, or initiate labetalol continuous infusion at 0.5-2 mg/min, titrate up by 0.5 mg/min every 10 min to a max of 10 mg/min.
Labetalol is often inadequate by itself for blood pressure control.
If there is evidence of acute aortic insufficiency, significant caution must be used when initiating β-blockade, because this intervention may blunt the patient’s compensatory tachycardia, leading to cardiovascular collapse. 
If β-blockade is contraindicated secondary to bronchospasm, consider a calcium channel blocker. 
Diltiazem IV 0.25 mg/kg bolus over 2 min, then start continuous infusion at 5 mg/h, titrating up by 5 mg/h every 30 min to a max of 15 mg/h.
The ACEP Clinical Guidelines agree with the recommendation to reduce the HR to <60 beats per minute and SBP to <120 mm Hg. However, the guidelines note that no specific HR or blood pressure goal has demonstrated a reduction in morbidity or mortality. 
While initiating HR and blood pressure control, urgent surgical consultation is advised for all ADs. Patients with Stanford Type A ADs should be taken for emergency surgical repair, whereas Stanford Type B ADs can be managed medically unless there is evidence of malperfusion syndrome, progression of dissection, enlarging aneurysm, or inability to control the blood pressure or pain. 
For Stanford Type A ADs, there is a significant difference in survival for those treated surgically versus those managed medically with HR and blood pressure control.
In-hospital mortality for a Stanford Type A AD managed surgically is currently 22% versus 57% for cases managed medically. 
Currently, Stanford Type A AD are surgically managed in an open fashion with graft repair of the aortic root and arch and may require aortic valve replacement.
Endovascular approaches utilizing stent grafts are not currently FDA approved for this purpose. 
For Stanford Type B AD, initial management is focused on excellent HR and blood pressure control to avoid propagation of the AD.
Currently, in-hospital mortality for a Stanford Type B AD is approximately 13%. 
Approximately one-third of patients with a Stanford Type B AD develop complications that require operative intervention such as malperfusion syndromes, signs of imminent rupture, expansion of aorta size, or hemodynamic instability. 
There is emerging evidence that stent grafting via thoracic endovascular aortic repair may provide for improved outcomes compared with medical management of Stanford Type B AD. 
Poor prognostic indicators have been identified for both Stanford Type A and Type B AD. 
For Stanford Type A ADs, a previous history of aortic valve replacement, migrating chest pain, presenting in shock or with tamponade physiology, limb ischemia, or hypotension are statistically significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.
For Stanford Type B ADs, the presence of mesenteric ischemia, presenting with hypotension or shock, acute renal failure, an aorta diameter larger than 5.5 cm, periaortic hematoma, limb ischemia, and older age are statistically significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.
Given similar mortality rates for individuals with intramural hematomas compared with true AD, a Class IIa Consensus Guideline exists that individuals presenting with an intramural hematoma should be treated in a fashion similar to an individual with a true AD at the level of the hematoma. 
Care of Patients Following Repair of Aortic Dissection
Prognosis following open surgical repair of a Stanford Type A AD is excellent, with a 96.1% survival rate at 1 y and 90.5% survival rate at 3 y after discharge from aortic repair. 
Individuals medically managed for a Stanford Type B AD have a survival rate of only 78% at 3 y following initial hospital discharge. 
Following the repair of a thoracic AD, meticulous management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and tobacco use are instrumental in mitigating future risk. 
A Class IIa consensus recommendation exists for follow-up after the repair of an AD or for individuals with a finding of intramural hematoma. Repeat CT angiography or MRA of the aorta is recommended at 1 mo, 3 mo, 6, mo, and 12 mo and then annually. 
Prevention
For general populations without specific risk factors, the control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, smoking cessation, and the avoidance of sympathomimetic agents (cocaine, methamphetamine) may reduce the risk of AD. Currently, there are no recommendations for routine surveillance to reduce the risk of AD in general populations. 
For individuals with anatomic or genetic risk factors for AD, there are disease-specific screening, prevention, and treatment recommendations:
Bicuspid Aortic Valve:
First-degree relatives of a patient with a known bicuspid aortic valve should have their aortic valve morphology and aorta evaluated for asymptomatic aortic disease. 
If the aortic valve is being repaired or replaced, aortic root or ascending aorta replacement is indicated when the aorta measures >4.5 cm or when the ratio of the maximal cross-sectional area of the ascending aorta (cm2) to the patient’s height (m) exceeds 10. 
Family History of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm or Aortic Dissection:
First-degree relatives of a patient with a thoracic AA or previous AD should undergo aortic imaging to identify those with asymptomatic disease. 
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome:
For individuals with the vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Type IV), surgical intervention is recommended when the aorta has expanded to a diameter of 4.0 to 5.0 cm. However, surgical repair is often complicated by fragile vascular tissue, impaired wound healing, and hemorrhage. 
Loeys-Dietz Syndrome:
At the time of diagnosis, individuals should have complete aortic imaging with repeat imaging at 6 mo to establish the rate of change. Afterward, annual surveillance MRI/MRA of the vasculature from the brain to pelvis is recommended. 
Surgical replacement of the aorta is indicated if the aortic diameter becomes larger than 4.2 cm on TEE or 4.4 to 4.6 cm on CT or MRI/MRA. 
Marfan Syndrome:
Echocardiography with attention to the aortic root is recommended at the time of diagnosis and 6 mo later to determine whether the ascending aorta has increased in size. For individuals with an aortic root larger than 4.5 cm, annual echocardiographic surveillance is recommended. 
All patients with Marfan syndrome and an aneurysmal aorta should be placed on a β-blocking agent and consideration should be given to adding an angiotensin receptor blocker to reduce hemodynamic stress on the aorta. 
In general, in Marfan syndrome, if the ascending thoracic aorta exceeds 5 cm in diameter or there is a greater than 0.5-cm increase in size per year, aortic root and ascending aorta replacement is indicated. Alternatively, if the ratio of the maximal cross-sectional area of the ascending aorta (cm2) to the patient’s height (m) exceeds 10, aortic root and ascending aorta replacement is recommended. Women with Marfan syndrome who are considering becoming pregnant are an exception to this recommendation. Instead, prophylactic replacement of the aortic root and ascending aorta is recommended if the diameter exceeds 4.0 cm.
Thoracic AA:
For patients without a clear genetic or valvular etiology for their thoracic AA, aortic surgery is indicated when the aorta is 5.5 cm or larger or if an annual rate of change exceeds 0.5 cm per year. 
Turner Syndrome:
At the time of diagnosis, individuals should undergo imaging of the heart and aorta with specific attention to evaluation of the aortic valve morphology, coarctation of the aorta, or dilation of the ascending aorta. If initial imaging is normal, follow-up imaging is recommended every 5 to 10 y. If initial imaging is abnormal, annual imaging and follow-up are recommended. ",Aortic Dissection
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Obtain a 12-lead ECG.
Place the patient on a cardiac monitor and obtain IV access.
Evaluate for and treat the underlying etiology (ie, sepsis, volume depletion, or pulmonary embolism).
Recognize that atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is often not the etiology behind the patient’s decompensation, and AF that is chronic or refractory may not convert to sinus rhythm.
Consider synchronized electrical cardioversion with a 200 J biphasic shock if patient
Is in shock
Demonstrates active ischemia on ECG
In frank pulmonary edema
Synchronized cardioversion is also the preferred treatment for AF with RVR in the setting of pre-excitation.
Patients with adequate volume and cardiac contractility can usually tolerate an elevated heart rate without difficulty.
Treatment options include:
Oral rate control or electrical/chemical rhythm control.
For specific doses, refer to the See: Treatment Section below.
IV Rate control
Diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV followed by a diltiazem drip (start at 5-10 mg/h)
Initiate at lower dosage in the elderly; eg, 10 mg IV loading dose.
Repeat the bolus if necessary at 0.35 mg/kg.
Hold the dose if patient becomes hypotensive.
Metoprolol 2.5-5 mg IV every 5-10 min until the rate is controlled. Hold if the patient becomes hypotensive..
Rate control, should be avoided in patients who are:
Hypotensive or have low left ventricular filling pressures (eg, absolute or relative volume depletion, pulmonary embolism [PE], or pericardial effusion)
Low systemic vascular resistance (ie, sepsis). These patients may require a rapid rate to compensate for a low stroke volume. In these cases, AF is the symptom, and the focus of care should be on the causative pathology.
Consider restoring sinus rhythm in cases in which low left ventricle contractility contributes to shock, and its contribution to ventricular filling can be very helpful.
Digoxin is very effective at slowing atrioventricular (AV) node conduction without depressing contractility. However, its onset of action is over hours

Key Concepts
AF is the most common dysrhythmia in the U.S., and it is characterized by uncoordinated and inefficient atrial activity. ECG Atrial flutter (AFl) is generally included in the discussion of AF. ECG
The ECG of a patient with AF is an irregular narrow or wide complex rhythm with no discernable P-waves. AFl has a characteristic sawtooth pattern at a rate of 240-360 beats/min (bpm) unless affected by medication. The ventricular rate may be either regular or irregular, depending on AV conduction.
When the ventricular rate is irregular, it is almost always regularly irregular, at some integer multiple of the atrial rate.
AF may be chronic, intermittent, or paroxysmal.
AF with RVR is rarely immediately life-threatening, but may be the result of other life-threatening pathophysiologies (ie, sepsis or volume depletion).
Future risk of stroke is the major concern, as AF is responsible for one-sixth of all cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs).
ED evaluation should be focused on restoring an acceptable ventricular rate (whether by rhythm or rate control) and evaluating the patient for the underlying causative etiology of the AF, the treatment of which often leads to resolution of the dysrhythmia.
Otherwise, symptomatic patients may be treated with rhythm or rate control.
Most patients with AF or AFl can be safely discharged home, provided that close outpatient follow-up is assured.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Patients classically present to the ED complaining of an irregular and rapid heart rate. However, in reality, the presentation of AF can range from asymptomatic discovery or, rarely, patients who are hemodynamically unstable from the degree of tachycardia.
History
Obtaining a history should focus on identifying a causative etiology. Ask the patient about fevers, coughing, signs of infection, potential volume depletion, shortness of breath, and unilateral leg swelling.
Inquire about associated symptoms concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or congestive heart failure (CHF), such as chest pain or an anginal equivalent, dyspnea, and lower extremity edema.
Document the onset of symptoms and, in particular, whether the patient is certain of the timing of these symptoms.
Review the patient’s past medical history for thyroid disease or a history of PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Review the patient’s records and previous ECGs for a history of AF and its chronicity: paroxysmal, intermittent, or chronic.
Review the patient’s records for a history of heart failure, valvular disease (especially mitral), and documentation of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF).
Ask about a family history of AF.
The social history should include alcohol use or recent binge drinking.
Physical Examination
Review the patient’s vital signs for fever, the degree of tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea. Tachycardia with AF is generally well tolerated.
Again, first evaluate for an underlying, causative etiology:
Thyromegaly or proptosis (hyperthyroid)
Pulmonary auscultation for infection or CHF
Extremity exam for bilateral (CHF) or unilateral (DVT) limb edema
Tests
ECG
The ECG is the first and most important diagnostic tool for AF and AFl.
AF is an irregularly irregular rhythm that has either a narrow or wide complex and no discernable P-waves. ECG
“Rapid rate” is defined as a heart rate greater than 100 bpm.
The ECG in AFl is characterized by a classic “sawtooth” pattern that is best seen in the inferior leads. An entirely upright P-wave in the V1 lead is typical in AFl and is not seen in sinus rhythm. ECG
The ECG in AFl is usually a regular rhythm, and in cases of 2:1 (atrial:ventricular) response, the ventricular rate remains steady at 150 bpm.
Patients with AF or AFl and a pre-existing bundle branch block (BBB) will maintain that BBB in AF or AFl.
Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) and AF will display an irregularly irregular wide complex but with polymorphic QRS complexes (complexes are not of uniform morphology) that do not demonstrate right or left BBB morphology.
The ECG machine may misinterpret AF, and especially AFl, as sinus tachycardia.
Imaging
Bedside point-of-care U/S is critical for identifying fluid status (inferior vena cava volume) and the presence of pulmonary edema (B-lines).
Inferior vena cava volume depletion with absent B-lines strongly suggests that the hemodynamic instability is NOT the result of RVR, but that RVR is the result of volume depletion.
Administer IV fluids rather than attempting cardioversion or rate control.
Order a CXR to look for an infection, infarction, or volume overload.
Obtain a chest CT to evaluate for PE if indicated.
A formal echo is eventually needed for patients diagnosed with AF, but this does not need to occur in the ED.
Laboratory studies
Order electrolytes, CBC, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) on all patients.
Coagulation studies will be needed in patients who are already taking or being discharged on oral anticoagulant medications.
Consider drawing a troponin, brain (or B-type) natriuretic peptide (BNP), or D-dimer depending on the clinical scenario.
Treatment
Treat the underlying etiology:
Fluids for volume depletion or sepsis
Antibiotics for infection
Thyroid storm (See Chapter: Thyroid Emergencies)
Anticoagulation if the patient is diagnosed with a PE
Unstable or stable
For unstable patients in shock who are volume depleted without pulmonary edema, start with volume repletion.
For unstable patients with pulmonary edema, proceed with synchronized cardioversion with a 200 J biphasic shock for unstable patients.
Patients who are not in shock, do not display evidence of ischemia on ECG, are hemodynamically stable, and are not in acute CHF can be managed with either rhythm or rate control.
Rhythm versus rate control
Rhythm control has historically been considered safe for patients with a definite onset of AF within 48 h. However, evidence suggests that cardioversion within 12 h is a more prudent strategy.  This can be achieved with electrical cardioversion or with IV antiarrhythmics, which include ibutilide and flecainide.
Electrical cardioversion should be performed using the synchronized setting with a 200 J (biphasic) shock. Use propofol as sedation if the patient’s blood pressure allows.
If electrical cardioversion fails:
A repeat can be facilitated by pretreatment with ibutilide 1 mg over 10 min. 
Only use ibutilide if the QTc (Bazett correction) is <480 ms and the EF is >30%.
The mean QTc prolongation with ibutilide is 50 ms, so observe the patient until the QTc normalizes after cardioversion.
Chemical cardioversion dosing as suggested by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP):
Ibutilide
Pretreat with 2-4 g magnesium sulfate IV.
Ibutilide 1 mg IV over 10 min; can repeat in 10 min.
Monitor for 4 h and avoid in patients with QTc >480 ms as noted above.
Flecainide
300 mg PO ×1 if the patient’s mass is ≥70 kg or 200 mg PO ×1 if the mass is <70 kg.
Telemetry is not required.
Avoid in cases of structural heart disease or ACS.
EF must be >50%.
Rate control is an equally safe and effective immediate treatment option and can be achieved with beta blockers (BB) or calcium channel blockers (CCB).
Lenient rate control (heart rate <110 bpm) is recommended. Overaggressive rate control may result in bradycardia, which may not be well tolerated (especially in the elderly population).
Suggested dosing of oral medications:
Metoprolol 25 mg PO q6h in the ED, with a home dose of 50 mg PO BID.
Diltiazem 30 mg PO q6h in the ED with a home dose of 120 mg extended release daily.
In patients who require admission for other reasons or if the heart rate cannot be reasonably controlled, IV rate-controlling agents can be initiated. Suggested IV dosing:
Diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV followed by a diltiazem drip (start at 5-10 mg/h)
Initiate at lower dosage in the elderly; eg, 10 mg IV loading dose.
Repeat the bolus if necessary at 0.35 mg/kg.
Hold the dose if patient becomes hypotensive.
Metoprolol 2.5-5 mg IV every 5-10 min until the rate is controlled. Hold if the patient becomes hypotensive.
Anticoagulation
For the majority of patients, future stroke is the major concern with a diagnosis of AF.
Stroke risk is calculated using the CHADS2-VAS2c score, and must be balanced with bleeding risk (HAS-BLED score). Table and Table
Patients with a score of 0 do not need anticoagulation (AC).
Patients with a score of 1 should be considered for a daily aspirin or AC.
Patients with a score >1 require AC.
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now recommended as the agents of choice by the 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for patients with AF.
However, patients with severe valvular disease or mechanical valves require AC with warfarin and not DOACs.
Initiating AC in the ED is resource intensive and can sometimes be deferred if extremely close outpatient follow-up can be arranged.
The ACEP “AFib Tool” exists as a valuable guide for the care of ED patients with AF (https://www.acep.org/patient-care/afib/).
Disposition
Most stable patients can be discharged home after undergoing electrical cardioversion or with oral rate control.
Close outpatient follow-up with either the patient’s primary care physician or a cardiologist is imperative for patients discharged from the ED. ACEP recommends follow-up within 3-5 d.
The following patients require admission:
Those who are hemodynamically unstable or with suspected acute CHF or ACS.
Those who require treatment of their underlying etiology.
Those on continuous IV infusions.
Those who are unable to be safely discharged for other reasons (ie, social, support) require admission to the hospital.",Atrial Fibrillation

Background
Epidemiology
AF remains the most common dysrhythmia in the world, and accounts for 1% of ED visits in the U.S. 
Hospitalization is responsible for the majority of the >$26 billion spent annually on the treatment of patients with AF in the U.S.  Increasing rates of heart disease and an aging baby boomer population have led to dramatically increased hospitalization rates over the past 2 decades. 
AF is often the result of other pathophysiologic mechanisms (ie, sepsis, dehydration, thyrotoxicosis, and PE). Accordingly, the ED clinician must avoid focusing solely on the dysrhythmia.
AF with RVR is often the result of permanent AF with a superimposed acute illness.
AF is rarely acutely life-threatening, and its major morbidity and mortality lies in future stroke risk, the incidence of which can range from <1% to nearly 20%. It is estimated that one-sixth of strokes are the result of AF. 
The ED serves as the most common portal of entry for patients with AF, with historically >80% of ED visits for AF in the U.S. resulting in admission. 
Over the past 10 years, numerous studies have demonstrated that many patients with AF can be safely discharged from the ED.
Classification
AF is classified based on duration. It is helpful to have a basic understanding of terminology: 
Paroxysmal: AF <7 d.
Persistent AF: AF lasting >7 d.
Long-standing persistent: continuous AF for longer than a year.
Permanent AF: patients who remain in AF and no longer seek rhythm control interventions.
Pathophysiology
Hypertrophy, ischemia, dilation, infiltration, and fibrosis can all cause atrial remodeling. This eventually results in abnormal electrical activity and uncoordinated atrial contraction.
AF is caused by many micro-reentrant loops within the atria and results in totally erratic atrial activity at a rate of 400-600 bpm.
The competing micro-reentrant loops provide a continuous, irregularly irregular input into the AV node.
The rate of ventricular response depends on autonomic and other chemical inputs into the AV node, and the resulting refractory period of the nodal tissue.
RVR is defined as a ventricular rate >100 bpm.
Causes of AF are broad and include some modifiable risk factors: 
Modifiable risk factors
Hypertension
Obesity
Sleep apnea
Alcohol: acute (“holiday heart”) and chronic
Smoking
Exercise
Other causes
Autonomic dysfunction
Cardiomyopathy
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Genetic predisposition
Heart failure
Hyperthyroid
Hypothermia
PE
Valvular heart disease
Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation
Pre-excited AF results when AF occurs in the presence of an accessory pathway capable of anterograde conduction (ie, WPW).
If the accessory pathway permits rapid conduction, the normal physiologic protection of the AV node is bypassed and the resulting rapid ventricular rate may cause hemodynamic compromise or degenerate at any time into ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
Pre-excited AF is recognized by an irregularly irregular wide complex rhythm with polymorphic QRS complexes. R-R intervals that are occasionally as short as 180-200 ms are particularly characteristic.
Atrial Flutter
AFl is produced by a macro-reentrant loop in the right atrium just above the AV node.
The atrial rate in AFl ranges from 240 to 360 bpm, and the resulting ventricular rate is determined by the AV node, which may have fixed (producing a regular ventricular rate at a multiple of the atrial rate) or variable conduction ECG (producing a regularly irregular rhythm with R-R intervals at varying multiples of the atrial rate).
In most physiologic states, the AV node conducts the atrial circuit in a 2:1 fashion, resulting in a regular rhythm around 150 bpm without rate variation. ECG
If the atrial rate is sufficiently slowed by medications (Type I antidysrhythmics) to rates below 240 bpm, or if there is abnormally fast conduction through or around the AV node, 1:1 conduction is possible with an extremely fast and dangerous ventricular response.
The AFl circuit usually produces a continuous sawtooth pattern best visualized in leads II and V1, but occasionally appears only as small narrow spikes with the false appearance of a return to baseline between them.
The QRS complex should begin on precisely the same point of the flutter wave every time, unless there is a simultaneous Wenckebach.
Fully upright P-waves in the V1 lead likely represent AFl (unless there is sinus tachycardia in the setting of severe right atrial hypertrophy).
The sawtooth baseline of AFl may simulate or hide ST-segment changes. ECG
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The classic presentation of AF is that of a patient who complains of their “heart racing.” However, in reality, presentations of AF range from asymptomatic to acutely ill.
The incidental diagnosis of AF is common.
History
Obtaining a history should focus on identifying a causative etiology. Ask the patient about fevers, signs of an infection, reasons for volume depletion, shortness of breath, and unilateral leg swelling.
Ask about associated symptoms concerning for ACS or CHF, including chest pain or an anginal equivalent, dyspnea, and lower extremity edema.
Document the onset of the patient’s symptoms and, in particular, whether the patient is certain of this timing.
Review the patient’s past medical history for thyroid disease and a history of PE or DVT.
Ask about any family history of AF.
The social history should include alcohol use or recent binge drinking and other drugs, especially sympathomimetics.
Physical
Review the patient’s vital signs for fever, degree of tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, and tachypnea.
While often alarming to ED staff, tachycardia with AF is generally well tolerated.
Again, first focus on identifying the underlying etiology:
Evaluate for thyromegaly or proptosis (hyperthyroid)
Evidence of an infection or CHF on the pulmonary exam
Bilateral (CHF) or unilateral (DVT) extremity edema
ECG
AF is an irregularly irregular rhythm that may have either narrow or wide complexes.
AF can be differentiated from other irregular rhythms, such as multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), by the absence of distinct P-waves.
The atria depolarize at extremely high rates (300-600 bpm), resulting in the classic fibrillatory pattern seen on ECG.
Early after the onset of AF, the baseline of the ECG can be “bumpy” and give the appearance of P-waves occurring at a rapid rate (“coarse AF”). However, these pseudo-P-waves have an irregular morphology and do not occur regularly.
Ventricular rates depend on numerous factors (eg, medications and autonomic tone) and range from 100-240 bpm.
The ECG in AFl is characterized by a classic “sawtooth” pattern that is best seen in the inferior leads. ECG
The ECG in AFl is usually a regular rhythm, and in cases of 2:1 (atrial:ventricular response), the ventricular rate remains steady at 150 bpm.
Patients with AF and a pre-existing BBB will display an irregularly irregular rhythm with a wide complex. The complexes will have a similar morphology. ECG
Patients with AF and WPW will present with an irregularly irregular rhythm and a wide complex that is differentiated from BBB by the presence of QRS morphologies that change significantly in amplitude and width, and a rate that is often >250-300 bpm.
AFl and a pre-existing BBB will display a regular (if fixed AV conduction) or regularly irregular (if variable conduction) wide complex rhythm. All complexes will have the same morphology.
AFl and WPW will display a regular (if fixed AV conduction) or regularly irregular (if variable conduction) wide complex rhythm. The wide complex of AFl and WPW is differentiated from BBB by polymorphic QRS complexes and extremely short R-R intervals. ECG
Laboratory Evaluation
In all patients, obtain
Electrolytes
Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
TSH
Patients requiring AC will need a CBC, LFTs (for DOACs), and coagulation studies.
Based on clinical presentation
CBC if there is concern for anemia or infection
D-dimer
BNP if there is concern for decompensated heart failure
Troponin only if there is concern for ACS. A troponin level in a low-risk patient can still be positive due to a rate-related elevation. This may commit the patient to a prolonged ED or hospital stay.
Radiographic Evaluation
Clinical presentation should guide imaging.
Order a CXR if there is concern for infection or heart failure
Obtain CT imaging to further evaluate potential underlying etiology (ie, a chest or abdominal CT if sepsis is considered).
Formal echocardiography is not indicated in the immediate evaluation of patients with AF, and can be deferred to specialty follow-up or the inpatient unit if the patient requires admission.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment
Historically, the U.S. has higher admission rates for AF than Canada and other countries.
However, over the past 10 years, significant supporting evidence has arisen that has led to guideline and practice changes, resulting in increased rates of patients being discharged home from the ED.
The primary focus of patient care for AF should be on treating the underlying etiology. Premature fixation on rate or rhythm control can result in deleterious consequences. For example, treating a tachycardic septic patient with a rate-controlling agent can result in hemodynamic collapse. In this situation, the initial focus should be on volume resuscitation and infection control.
Unstable patients require immediate synchronized cardioversion (200 J biphasic) (AHA Class I, Level C). There is no universally accepted definition for “unstable”, but this group should generally include:
Patients in clinical shock
Respiratory distress related to acute decompensated heart failure
Ischemia caused by poor coronary perfusion, whether
Due to hypotension
Due to ACS
AF with RVR in the setting of pre-excitation (ie, WPW)
Conversion of patients who have permanent AF may be futile, as most will not convert.
The ACEP “AFib Tool” exists as a valuable guide in the care of ED patients with AF (https://www.acep.org/patient-care/afib/).
Rhythm Versus Rate Control
After identifying and addressing any underlying etiologies, treatment of the stable patient with AF can occur with either rhythm or rate control.
The ED clinician typically chooses therapy based on personal experience and local practice habits.
Both approaches are considered Class I, Level B recommendations by the 2014 AHA and ACC guidelines.
Numerous studies from Canada supported ED cardioversion and discharge as a safe and effective treatment for AF that was associated with increased patient satisfaction. 
However, in the recently published RACE-7 study, investigators prospectively randomized over 400 patients to receive either ED cardioversion or ED rate control, and found no difference in ED discharge rates, return visits, or cardiovascular complications. At 4 wk follow-up, 94% vs 91% of patients were in sinus rhythm. 
Rhythm Control
Rhythm control can be achieved with synchronized electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion.
Electrical cardioversion should be performed in hemodynamically unstable patients, including those in rapid AF with WPW, ACS, or acute CHF.
In stable patients, rhythm control hinges on the definite onset of AF of <48 h. The risk of embolic events significantly increases when the onset of dysrhythmia is >48 h. It is therefore imperative to obtain a careful history. Specifically, ask the patient about the exact time of symptom onset and whether any possibility exists of recent similar episodes.
Given the higher stroke risk after 12 h, it may be prudent to limit ED cardioversions to those with <12 h of symptoms. 
Electrical cardioversion:
Performed in synchronized mode with a 200 J (biphasic) shock.
If the patient is able to tolerate the possible brief hypotension, propofol with analgesia (eg, fentanyl) provides ideal brief sedation.
Chemical cardioversion:
A variety of agents can be used for chemical cardioversion, including procainamide, amiodarone, flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, and IV ibutilide. 
The ACEP “AFib Tool” endorses and provides specific guidance on the use of ibutilide and flecainide (https://www.acep.org/patient-care/afib/):
Ibutilide
May prolong the QT and should not be used in patients with a Bazett corrected QTc >480 ms. 
Pretreat with magnesium sulfate 2-4 g IV.
Ibutilide 1 mg IV over 10 min, with repeat dose if needed in 10 min.
Patients require at least 4 h of telemetry.
Flecainide
The advantage of flecainide is that cardiac monitoring is unnecessary after its administration. However, flecainide should be avoided in patients with ACS or any history of structural heart disease.
Flecainide 300 mg PO ×1 if ≥70 kg or 200 mg PO ×1 if <70 kg.
Patients may require AC after cardioversion (see below).
Rate Control
Avoid rate control before addressing and treating the underlying etiology. Rapid heart rate is often a compensatory mechanism in patients with hypovolemic or distributive shock. Rate control of these patients is extremely dangerous.
Rate control is also contraindicated in unstable or hypotensive patients. Dysrhythmia management in these cases should be with electrical cardioversion.
Rate control is usually more appropriate than rhythm control for those with an unknown or prolonged duration of AF/AFl, elderly patients (>65 y), valvular disease, or a high stroke risk as a result of cardioversion. These patients will generally require a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and/or several weeks of AC prior to any attempted cardioversion. 
Rate-controlling agents
The 2 most commonly used agents in this situation are CCBs (predominantly diltiazem) and BBs (predominantly metoprolol).
The relative efficacy of diltiazem vs metoprolol is a long-term controversy, with reasonable evidence that both medications are safe, effective, and guideline-recommended. However, there is relatively little head-to-head randomized controlled data that compares the two agents. The available high-quality literature suggests that diltiazem may achieve better heart rate control than metoprolol, but the very small populations used in these studies warrant further high-quality trials.
CCBs should be avoided in patients with acute heart failure or those with a low EF. BBs should be avoided in patients with asthma but are preferred in the setting of thyrotoxicosis.
Esmolol has the advantage of a short duration of action. If shock/hypotension occurs, the infusion may be terminated.
Digoxin is the least likely to result in dangerous hypotension but must be serially loaded and requires at least 3 h to achieve its maximum effect.
There has been some evidence that IV magnesium can provide some degree of rate control, but adverse reactions may outweigh its benefits. 
Heart Rate Goal
AHA/ACC guidelines recommend 80 bpm as a reasonable heart rate goal (Class IIa, Level B). 
However, lenient rate control (<110 bpm) is likely to be a safer strategy for elderly patients who have difficulty tolerating unintentional bradycardia.
Administration
Rate-controlling medications can be given via an oral or IV route. Oral rate control in stable patients prevents unnecessary hospital admissions, and is favored over the previous tendency towards reflexive IV administration.
IV rate control is appropriate in situations where the patient clearly requires admission to the hospital or adequate rate control cannot be achieved.
IV dosing
Metoprolol 2.5-5 mg IV bolus, up to 3 doses.
Esmolol 500 μg/kg IV bolus, followed by an infusion at 50-300 μg/kg/min.
Diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus, followed by an infusion at 5-15 mg/h.
Lower bolus doses (eg, 10 mg) or avoiding a loading dose altogether is recommended in elderly patients who may not tolerate bradycardia.
Oral (PO)
Metoprolol 25 mg PO q6h can be given in the ED, with a transition to metoprolol 50 mg PO BID as an outpatient.
Alternatively, rate control can be achieved with diltiazem 30 mg PO q6h, with a transition to diltiazem 120 mg PO extended release q24h.
Anticoagulation
AF is a major cause of stroke
One-sixth of ischemic strokes result from AF. 
It is not uncommon to discover AF incidentally on the ECG of a patient who presents to the ED with a CVA.
AC can reduce the risk of a stroke by up to 80%. 
There is also some evidence that the early initiation of AC can prevent vascular dementia in patients with AF. 
Indications for AC are based on calculated stroke risk. The CHA2DS2-VASc is the most commonly used tool. Table and Table
Patients with a score of 0 generally do not require AC.
Patients with a score of 1 can be treated with either no AC, aspirin, or oral AC (OAC). Shared decision-making is recommended when considering the therapeutic plan.
Patients with a score of 2 or greater require treatment with OAC.
Choice of AC
IV heparin should be started for patients being admitted for ACS, or those who are admitted for TEE-guided cardioversion.
OACs include warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), which were previously known as novel OACs.
The AHA and ACC now recommend DOACs over warfarin for AF, except in patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves. 
DOACs
DOACs include either direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) or Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban).
DOACs have largely replaced warfarin due to their ease of use, which includes the elimination of bridging, monitoring, and dietary restrictions. Concerns regarding the current inability to reverse DOAC agents in case of bleeding have gradually decreased given the continued introduction of (costly) reversal agents.
DOAC dosing is dependent on and may be limited by the patient’s renal and hepatic function. In addition, apixaban should not be given to patients over 80 y old or with a low body mass index or weight <60 kg.
Risk of bleeding
The decision to initiate AC must be balanced with the risk of bleeding.
Calculate the bleeding risk rather than citing clinical concern alone. Clinician estimates of bleeding risk do not correlate with calculated risks, with fall risk being the most commonly cited reason for withholding AC.  The HAS-BLED Score demonstrated superior performance compared with others.  Table
Patients with a score >2 are at an increased risk of bleeding, and the decision to initiate AC must be taken with caution. Table
Anticoagulation and cardioversion
When the onset of AF is unclear or >48 h prior to presentation, stable patients should be treated with either 3 wk of AC before cardioversion or undergo a TEE-guided cardioversion.  Regardless of stroke risk, these patients will also require AC for at least 4 wk after cardioversion.
Patients with low stroke risk in AF for less than 48 h do not necessarily require AC after cardioversion, although this is somewhat controversial.
Disposition
As mentioned earlier, both rhythm and rate control represent effective strategies for the safe and expedited discharge of patients.
Clinicians in Canada and other countries outside the U.S. have practiced discharge after ED rhythm control for many years. Numerous Canadian studies document successful discharge after IV or electrical cardioversion. 
Procainamide infusion is most commonly used, although ACEP guidelines favor ibutilide or flecainide.
For many reasons, including the non-uniformity of healthcare systems and the legal climate, care in the U.S. has traditionally employed IV rate control and hospital admission. Fortunately, substantial existing evidence has led to more progressive guideline updates, and the U.S. has seen significant progress in the safe discharge of patients home from the ED over the past decade.
Hospital admission:
Patients who are hemodynamically unstable, present with ACS or decompensated heart failure, or have AF due to an underlying etiology require admission to the hospital.
Outpatient management:
Patients without any of the high-risk features mentioned above can be discharged home after ED cardioversion or the start of oral rate-controlling medications.
Avoiding hospital admissions results in a significant reduction in healthcare expenditure, decreases iatrogenic risk, and improves patient satisfaction.
A standardized approach is recommended to ensure appropriate care and reliable follow-up. It should include a simple evaluation and treatment algorithm, as well as coordinated care with cardiology for close outpatient follow-up. 
Shared decision-making serves as a valuable communication tool for facilitating the conversation between the clinician and patient and, in the case of AF, decisions regarding treatment options and the initiation of AC. 
Patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 and a HAS-BLED score <3 require AC.
As the ED environment is not conducive to the complex and time-intensive decisions involved in the initiation of OAC, it is reasonable to defer starting AC if very short term follow-up (days) can be arranged. Patients should be educated regarding risk vs. benefit, and participate in shared decision-making with the ED provider.
Case managers and social workers are extremely helpful when available, and can assist with arranging follow-up appointments and obtaining medications. Insurance authorization or redeeming vouchers for DOACs is a particularly time-intensive process.
The ACEP recommends follow-up within 3-5 days with a primary care physician or cardiologist (https://www.acep.org/patient-care/afib/).
All patients should receive clear discharge instructions regarding their medications and follow-up, and a list of indications to return to the ED, which include chest pain, syncope or near syncope, shortness of breath, and head injury in the case of those on OAC.",Atrial Fibrillation
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Automatic Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD)
Place on a cardiac monitor.
If the patient is receiving repeated AICD shocks, determine the underlying rhythm to identify whether these discharges are appropriate or inappropriate.
Appropriate shock: Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is present.
If the AICD shocks are not terminating the VT/VF, apply the external pads and treat using standard care.
Likely will need to disable AICD via magnet placement.
If the AICD is terminating the VT/VF, but the patient repeatedly goes back into this rhythm, add antiarrhythmics and assess for emergency secondary causes (ie, acute coronary syndrome [ACS]).
Electrically treat recurrent dysrhythmia with either the AICD or disable the AICD with a magnet and use a standard monitor-defibrillator for appropriate electrical therapy.
Amiodarone: 150 mg IV over 10 min (may repeat once) followed by continuous infusion at 0.5-1 mg/min (Note: Cardiac arrest dose is 300 mg bolus) OR
Lidocaine: 1-1.5 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5-0.75 mg/kg repeated bolus q10min (max 3 mg/kg total) OR
Procainamide: Loading dose 15-18 mg/kg IV (12 mg/kg in renal insufficiency) or 100-200 mg IV over 25-30 min, followed by a continuous infusion at 1-4 mg/min.
If the patient is suspected of re-entering VT/VF due to an underlying ACS, contact Interventional Cardiology (transfer if needed), as these are indications for emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the setting of ACS.
Inappropriate shock: For supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or entities producing large T waves or device malfunction.
With repeated shocks, place a magnet on the patient to disable the AICD.
If the AICD is disabled, electrically monitor the patient and have standard defibrillation capability ready.
In SVT, rate control can stop the AICD from triggering.
Metoprolol: 2.5-5 mg IV bolus, may repeat q5min up to 15 mg OR
Diltiazem: 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 min followed by continuous infusion at 5-10 mg/h OR
Amiodarone (may cardiovert): 150 mg IV over 10 min (may repeat once) followed by continuous infusion at 0.5-1 mg/min.
Large T waves, such as hyperkalemia or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
Disable AICD via magnet placement.
Large T waves are interpreted by the AICD as a QRS complex.
Thus, the ventricular rate is doubled and can indicate a “tachycardia,” triggering AICD shock.
Treat with usual hyperkalemia and STEMI measures, prioritizing calcium gluconate or calcium chloride.
For patients in persistent ventricular storm resistant to electricity, antiarrhythmics, and with no reversible cause, strongly consider intubation and sedation.
Key Concepts
Patients with implantable devices (AICD, pacemakers, and assist devices) frequently present to the ED.
It is important that the emergency physician understand how these devices function, can recognize unique related issues, and is able to treat associated medical conditions.
An automatic implantable cardiac device (AICD) is used to immediately treat patients who develop ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).
There are 3 common scenarios when patients present with AICD-related issues:
The device was discharged (ie, electrically shocked the patient), and the patient was told to come to the ED.
The device is repeatedly discharging (ie, electrically shocking the patient).
The patient has cardiopulmonary complaints (syncope, dyspnea, etc.) that may be related to or impacted by the AICD.
The key is to determine whether an AICD delivered an electrical shock and, if so, whether it was appropriate.
Intervention is considered appropriate when an AICD intervenes in VT/VF.
In a stable patient, a device interrogation is needed.
In the patient being actively shocked, first, ask: “Are these AICD discharges appropriate?”
If the firing is appropriate:
If the AICD is breaking the rhythm, check for an underlying cause and add antiarrhythmic agents.
If the AICD is not breaking the rhythm, place external pads and manage the same as any other VT/VF patient.
Consider disabling with a magnet as the clinician manages the dysrhythmia in a standard fashion.
If the firing is inappropriate:
Disable the AICD with a magnet, and leave the magnet on the patient’s chest.
Two magnets may be needed in obese patients.
Once the AICD is disabled, it is the responsibility of the clinician to monitor and treat dysrhythmias.
Key Diagnostic Elements
In stable patients, symptoms that suggest possible AICD-related issues include palpitations, dyspnea, syncope, or non-specific dizziness.
History
The history should be similar to the usual evaluation of these chief complaints, with additional questions to determine:
Indication for AICD placement.
Device manufacturer, if interrogation is necessary.
Date of device implantation.
Trauma to the chest wall or device pocket.
Exposure to magnetic devices such as MRI, airport metal detectors, or smartphone in shirt pocket overlying the device, etc.
Medication changes.
Recent device re-programming.
Date of last device interrogation.
Inciting events or activities leading to the ED visit.
Physical Exam
Check AICD pocket
Signs of infection include redness, pain, and fluctuance.
Look for wound dehiscence.
Device extrusion.
Cardiac exam
Evaluate rate and rhythm.
Muffled heart sounds or rubs in the setting of effusion.
Murmurs in the setting of endocarditis.
S3 or S4 in the setting of HF.
Lungs
Absent breathing sounds in the setting of pneumothorax.
Wheezes or rales in the setting of HF.
Extremities
Edema in the setting of HF.
Pain, swelling, redness of the ipsilateral upper extremity in the setting of thrombophlebitis.
Splinter hemorrhages, Osler’s nodes, and Janeway lesions in suspected endocarditis.
ECG
Most post-shock ECGs will show some degree of ST segment elevation or depression without actual underlying ischemia. These should resolve within 5-15 min.
Similarly, it is not uncommon for high-sensitivity (hs) troponins to be elevated, although these elevations are usually of lower magnitude.
Post-shock ECG may also demonstrate other non-ischemic causes of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), such as long-QT or Brugada syndrome.
Radiology
Chest X-ray
Lead placement/displacement
Assess for potential lead fracture
Pneumothorax

ECHO
Use bedside echo to look for pericardial effusion and/or tamponade physiology.
CT
Identify the presence and depth of pocket infection.
Laboratory Evaluation
Blood cultures in the setting of suspected lead or pocket infection.
Treatment
Rapid IV access.
Place on a cardiac monitor and obtain a 12-lead ECG.
If the patient is unstable, apply external pads in preparation for defibrillation or synchronized cardioversion.
If the patient is receiving repeated AICD discharges, first determine the underlying rhythm to identify whether these shocks are appropriate or inappropriate.
Appropriate:
Shocks are appropriate when firing for VT/VF.
If the AICD shocks are not breaking the VT/VF, apply external pads and treat with usual ACLS-guided care.
If the AICD is breaking the VT/VF, but the patient repeatedly goes back into this rhythm, add antiarrhythmics and assess for emergency secondary causes (ie, ACS).
Amiodarone 150 mg IV over 10 min (may repeat once) followed by continuous infusion at 0.5-1 mg/min (Note: Cardiac arrest dose is 300 mg bolus) OR
Lidocaine 1-1.5 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.5-0.75 mg/kg repeated bolus q10min (max 3 mg/kg total) OR
Procainamide: Loading dose 15-18 mg/kg IV (12 mg/kg in renal insufficiency) or 100-200 mg IV over 25-30 min, followed by a continuous infusion at 1-4 mg/min.
If the patient is suspected of re-entering VT/VF due to underlying ACS, contact Interventional Cardiology, since this is an indication for emergency PCI.
Inappropriate:
Inappropriate firing can occur with SVT (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, etc.) or hyperkalemia.
Use a magnet to disable AICD if repeated shocks are inappropriate.
If the cause is an SVT, rate control will help to stop shocks and triggering of the AICD.
Metoprolol 2.5-5 mg IV bolus, may repeat q5min up to 15 mg OR
Diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 min followed by continuous infusion at 5-10 mg/h OR
Amiodarone (may cardiovert): 150 mg IV over 10 m (may repeat once) followed by continuous infusion at 0.5-1 mg/min.
Hyperkalemia and its associated peaked T-waves can trigger the AICD.
Treat with usual hyperkalemia measures, prioritizing calcium gluconate or calcium chloride.
Disposition
Consider discharge in stable patients with a normal ED evaluation and:
No AICD discharge.
An isolated appropriate discharge for VT.
A single inappropriate discharge and no underlying cause.
Discussion with Cardiology or Electrophysiology is recommended to coordinate follow-up and possible medication adjustments.
Discourage patients from driving until they can follow up.
Hospital admission advised for:
Any patients who have recurrent VT/VF. Consider cardiac ICU (CCU) or medical ICU.
Any patients with evidence of non-reversible causes of AICD discharge.
Ischemia, severe electrolyte derangements, decompensated HF.
Patients with lead fracture or migration.
Consider OR/Surgery for patients:
With ventricular storm
Discuss with Interventional Cardiology and/or Electrophysiology for consideration of emergency PCI or ablation.
Requiring emergency pacemaker revision
Severe lead displacement due to pocket hematoma, abscess, or other cause.
Charting Pearls
AICD
Be sure to document AICD-specific history and physical exam findings, including the possible number of shocks delivered, preceding symptoms, time of the last shock, and integrity of the AICD pocket.
Keep all print-outs from device interrogation and either scan to the chart or give to the consulting cardiologist or the patient or patient’s family.",Automated Internal Cardioverter-Defibrillators (AICD)
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
The purpose of an AICD is to identify and treat VAs to prevent sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).
In the U.S., approximately 300,000 people per year suffer from an out-of-hospital SCA. 
A significant portion of these are due to VAs, such as VT or VF. While the overall rate of out-of-hospital SCA survival is low, the data demonstrate that SCA from VT/VF has a survival rate of 27-40%.
Identifying patients who are at a high risk of VAs and providing a mechanism for early intervention can dramatically reduce mortality.
Pathophysiology
Structural abnormalities and primary electrical disorders comprise the majority of those who qualify for AICDs.
Structural abnormalities may place people at a higher risk of SCA.
Examples include: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severely depressed left ventricular function, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and certain congenital anomalies.
Furthermore, indwelling devices (ie, left ventricular assist devices) also elevate the risk of VAs.
There are also numerous primary electrical disorders that carry an increased risk of VAs.
Some examples are congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, or those with previous VT/VF events without a reversible cause.
More than ⅓ of patients who have had previous VT/VF will have an appropriate discharge of their AICD within 2 years of implantation. 
Components & Function
To understand how to approach patients in the ED with an AICD, it is essential to understand the basics of how an AICD works.
An AICD is a single (usually RV) or dual (right atrium, sometimes also left ventricle) lead system that can detect myocardial depolarizations (ie, the ventricular rate).
Depolarization threshold
Since VT/VF tends to occur at higher rates, cardiologists pre-set the AICD to a particular rate threshold (ex: 170 bpm).
If the leads sense a sustained rate above this preset number, the AICD interprets this as likely VT or VF.
Understandably, heart rates can easily exceed this threshold, and thus the AICD has some fine-tuning features that help to differentiate an SVT from VT/VF.
SVT, in this case, refers to the more technical definition of any tachycardia that arises from above the atrioventricular (AV) node (AVNRT, AVRT, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia).
Differentiating SVT from VT/VF
Single-chamber (RV) methods of differentiation:
Timing: VT is usually abrupt in onset, whereas sinus tachycardia is more gradual. This single criterion can differentiate between the two with a sensitivity of 98%.  This does not work as well for differentiating VT from other arrhythmias that may also be abrupt in onset, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) or paroxysmal-SVT.
Stability: Unstable, variable rates, such as AF, are less likely to be VT. This inhibits AICD functioning and prevents inappropriate firing.
Morphology: More modern AICDs can identify, in a binary fashion, whether the current QRS complex matches the pre-programmed baseline.
Dual-chamber methods of differentiation:
AV comparison: In addition to the above methods, dual-chamber AICDs can identify whether atrial activity is aligned with ventricular activity. Because VT is a rhythm distinct from the atria, dissociation suggests VT and encourages an electrical intervention.
All of the cited methods for distinguishing between SVT and VT/VF are pre-programmed in addition to manufacturer-specific presets. A cardiologist can change these if patients are repeatedly victims of inappropriate shocks.
While these methods are quite useful in differentiating between VT/VF and SVT, they are not perfect.
AICD Reponse
Once the AICD determines a rhythm is VT/VF, there are generally two responses to these arrhythmias: Anti-tachycardic pacing (ATP) or shock (defibrillation or cardioversion).
Anti-tachycardic pacing (ATP)
These are usually short bursts of pacing designed to intercept the reciprocating ventricular depolarization wave and thus break the electrical circuit. In other words, ATP can help to break the cycle of VT and re-establish a normal sinus rhythm.
ATP terminates up to 95% of VT.  ATP is not painful to patients and can help prevent sudden, uncomfortable interventions such as cardioversion.
Defibrillation/Cardioversion
This is the back-up intervention in case ATP fails to break the ventricular rhythm. It delivers up to 8 sequential shocks that are intended to terminate the arrhythmia.
Appropriate vs. Inappropriate.
AICD interventions are classified as appropriate or inappropriate. Approximately 70% of AICD discharges are appropriate, while the remaining 30% are inappropriate. 
Intervention is considered appropriate when an AICD intervenes in VT/VF.
Intervention is deemed inappropriate when it occurs in any other situation.
86% of these inappropriate shocks are from a dysrhythmia, most commonly AF (55%). Interrogation of the device will provide evidence of over-sensing.
Other than an SVT mimicking VT/VF, there are several other situations in which an AICD may inappropriately fire.
Hyperkalemia
Elevated potassium can cause peaked T-waves that appear as another QRS complex and lead to over-sensing, thus doubling the perceived ventricular rate. This mimics a sustained tachycardia above the AICD’s threshold, prompting inappropriate firing.
Lead fracture
Erosion of the AICD leads can break down the protective insulation barrier and lead to over-activation of the AICD.
Mechanical problems with AICD leads can be initially evaluated with a chest X-ray.
Electromagnetic interference (EMI)
EMI can alter the AICD programming and lead to inappropriate firing. This should be a diagnosis of exclusion (See more below in: Special Situations).
Diagnostic Considerations
There are three different scenarios in which AICDs are encountered in the ED:
The patient has received a shock from their device.
The device is continually firing.
The patient presents with a possible arrhythmia-related chief complaint such as dizziness, dyspnea, or syncope.
For patients who are sent to the ED and are stable, the goal is to determine whether the AICD fired.
A device interrogation should be arranged to determine whether the device truly fired.
A phantom firing is when the patient perceives a discharge of their device but, after interrogation, no intervention actually occurred.
History
The initial part of the history should be similar to other chief complaints. However, the review of systems should be tailored to identify other factors that may suggest an etiology of either an appropriate or inappropriate discharge of the AICD.
History should include any recent trauma, exposure to electromagnetic interference, medication changes, recent device re-programming, and date of last device interrogation.
Basic knowledge of how an AICD works and what provokes device intervention can help inform the history and physical exam when evaluating these patients.
As an example, patients who present with profound diarrhea and vomiting may suffer from clinically significant hypokalemia. As a result, these patients may have an acquired prolonged QT interval that resulted in polymorphic VT and thus an appropriate device intervention. Therefore, the history and physical exam can yield important clues to the etiology of the patient’s presentation.
Device Identification & Interrogation
Enquire regarding when and why the AICD was placed.
The majority of patients carry a device identification card complete with the serial number, manufacturer, relevant contact information, and primary cardiologist.
Each AICD manufacturer has 24-h on-call technical support to aid with interrogation and interpretation. Interrogation can be either conducted remotely or the local on-call representative will perform an in-person interrogation.
Chest X-ray may assist in identification.
A variety of online algorithms exist to further aid in identification.  Algorithm
Physical Exam
Check the AICD pocket for signs of infection, wound dehiscence, or device extrusion.
Perform a cardiac exam, listening for a new murmur (endocarditis), S3 or S4 (HF), and muffled heart sounds or rubs (effusion).
Auscultate the lungs for bilateral breathing sounds (pneumothorax) or signs of HF.
Examine the extremities for edema (HF) or signs of upper extremity thrombophlebitis (pain, swelling, redness of ipsilateral upper extremity).
Inspect the skin for splinter hemorrhages, Osler’s nodes, and Janeway lesions if endocarditis is suspected.
ECG
Most post-shock ECGs will show some degree of ST segment elevation or depression without actual underlying ischemia. These should resolve within 5-15 min.
Similarly, it is not uncommon for hs-troponins to be elevated, although these elevations are trivial (<0.08 ng/mL).
Post-shock ECG may also demonstrate other non-ischemic causes of VAs, such as long-QT or Brugada syndrome.
Radiology
Chest X-ray
Chest X-ray can check for lead placement/displacement, lead fracture, pneumothorax, and assistance with device identification.
CT can be used to identify the presence and depth of pocket infection.
Use bedside echo to look for pericardial effusion and/or tamponade physiology.
Laboratory Evaluation
Check electrolytes.
Consider troponin and b-type natriuretic peptide, if clinically indicated.
Perform blood cultures in the setting of suspected lead or pocket infection.
Therapeutic Considerations
For the patient with a persistently firing AICD:
Other than identifying the patient’s clinical stability, the first step in the management of this situation is to determine whether the device is firing appropriately or inappropriately.
Inappropriate firing:
If the AICD is repeatedly firing inappropriately, a magnet should be applied externally to the chest overlying the AICD. Further investigation and management of the underlying cause should be performed.
If a magnet is used, it is important to have external cardioversion and defibrillation equipment easily accessible. These patients have the potential to deteriorate into unstable rhythms quickly and, with the magnet in place, have lost their back-up system.
Appropriate firing:
If the firing is appropriate, the device is either breaking the VT/VF, breaking it temporarily but the rhythm returns to VT/VF, or cannot break the rhythm at all.
When the device is not breaking the rhythm, anti-arrhythmic medications and external defibrillation via standard ACLS methods should be utilized.
Ensure that external defibrillation pads are placed on the patient 8-10 cm away from the battery to avoid damaging the device. As long as positioned correctly, it is safe to perform external cardioversion and defibrillation in these patients.
Checking for an underlying cause of a malignant arrhythmia is the next step in ED management.
Evaluation for the underlying etiology is similar to that of any patient who presents with VT/VF.
Persistent VT/VF in the setting of suspected NSTEMI is an indication for emergency catheterization per the 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines for NSTEMI management. 
Device interrogation
If no apparent cause is found, device-specific causes may be simultaneously investigated by device interrogation.
Older devices may be low on battery and lack sufficient energy to apply the appropriate voltage to cardiovert or defibrillate effectively.
An alternative cause may be lead dislodgement:
Causes include: Trauma, surrounding pocket hematoma or abscesses.
Imaging can help with the diagnosis.
These patients will require external ACLS-guided management for their dysrhythmia, specialist consultation, and admission.
Special Situations
Procedural Complications of AICD Placement
Rarely encountered in the ED, as these patients are usually observed in the hospital to monitor for these adverse events.
Hemothorax or pneumothorax may occur and are most common within 48 h of device placement. The treatment is with either a chest tube or a pigtail catheter.
Pericardial effusion and tamponade are usually evident immediately and present with hypotension and tachycardia. It will be diagnosed by ECG, and the treatment is emergency pericardiocentesis, or when uncontrolled, direct operative repair by a cardiothoracic surgeon.
Twiddler Syndrome
Rare (0.07-7% occurrence) complication where the patient manipulates (usually twists) the AICD generator, shortening the lead and/or fracturing the lead.
This causes an inability to sense or intervene in malignant arrhythmias. It most commonly occurs within the first year after implantation. 
A chest X-ray will show coiling of the device lead.
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
May cause over-sensing by the AICD and elicit inappropriate electrical intervention. Additionally, it can switch off sensing and disable any arrhythmia detection. This is more likely to occur in older devices.
Cell phones
It is recommended that digital cell phones not be carried in breast pockets, as this can potentially interfere with ICD function, although it extremely unlikely to provoke clinically significant device intervention. Regular use and storage of cell phones do not interfere with AICDs.
Metal detectors
May provoke over-sensing and inappropriate firing of the AICD.
EMI can occur in the presence of metal detectors and anti-theft security systems. These are mostly encountered when traveling or entering large events, such as concerts or sports arenas.
While it is generally safe to briskly walk through these devices, it is recommended to avoid lingering for more than 1 min.
The complication rate is higher with hand-held metal detectors, which should be avoided in patients with AICDs. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Some AICDs are MRI-compatible, and this information will be available from the manufacturer. Otherwise, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines have general recommendations regarding MRIs in patients with AICDs and pacemakers.  While the adverse event rate of burns and device malfunction is relatively rare, it is still possible. The relative safety depends on the site of imaging, study protocol, type of AICD, and the general risks and benefits.
Conducted electrical weapons (CEWs)
When patients are apprehended by law enforcement, they are sometimes subdued with a CEW.
CEWs, commonly known as stun guns or their commercial name TASER, can theoretically provide some element of EMI with AICDs.
While no large case studies or meta-analyses exist, a collection of case studies and in vivo swine studies have demonstrated no clinical effect of CEWs on AICDs. Generally, the electrical impulses of CEWs last no longer than 5 sec, which is not long enough to induce electrical intervention. 
“Low Tone”
A patient may present because they can hear a “low tone” from their device.
This low tone is an alarm in the AICD that can indicate:
The battery is low.
A lead is dislodged or broken.
The device is not adequately terminating an underlying arrhythmia.
Clinical evaluation and interrogation should yield the root cause. 
Phantom Shock
As mentioned above, a phantom shock is a patient-reported perception of an AICD shock without an actual AICD shock.
This can follow previous true shocks by the patient’s AICD and foster persistent anxiety. Patients with phantom shocks are more frequently depressed and anxious. 
In the absence of grave disability and suicidal ideation, outpatient follow-up with a primary care physician, and possibly psychiatry, may result in a better quality of life and fewer unnecessary ED visits.",Automated Internal Cardioverter-Defibrillators (AICD)

If indicated, obtain a head CT to rule out increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
Key Concepts
C3 review of bradycardia EM:RAP Audio ECG course on bradycardia EM:RAP Video
Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate of less than 50-60 beats/min (bpm) in adults (non-well-conditioned athletes) or a sinus pause >2-3 s.
Causes of bradycardia can be either intrinsic or extrinsic, all of which ultimately impair the conduction system of the heart, ie, sinoatrial (SA) or atrioventricular (AV) node.
The patient with bradycardia should be approached first on the basis of hemodynamic stability.
An unstable bradycardia occurs when there is a reduction in the heart rate that results in a low cardiac output requiring immediate intervention. Evidence of instability includes:
Hypotension with hypoperfusion
Altered mental status
Anginal chest pain
Dyspnea due to pulmonary congestion
In unstable patients, the goal of treatment is to increase the heart rate to achieve an adequate cardiac output.
Treatment of unstable bradydysrhythmias requires temporizing the patient with an external pacemaker, atropine, and/or adrenergic drugs to increase the heart rate until the underlying cause is identified and treated.
Atropine is a vagolytic and will not work for non-parasympathetic causes of bradycardia or infranodal blocks. It is not useful in most cases.
Epinephrine works on the entire myocardium and will increase the rate and contractility of the heart. If it is readily available, start with epinephrine instead of atropine.
Stable patients may not require intervention.
Treat the patient, not the number (ie, heart rate).
Bradycardia caused by metabolic/toxic insults (eg, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, hyperkalemia, or hypothyroidism) will respond poorly or not at all to standard therapy (ie, electrical pacing, atropine administration). The underlying disease must be managed first.
Consider hyperkalemia early, and if possible, obtain bedside potassium levels.
Key Diagnostic Elements
The majority of bradycardic patients will be asymptomatic.
In patients with bradycardia-impaired cardiac output, clinical presentations may vary and can include lightheadedness, near syncope, syncope, chest pain, pulmonary edema, heart failure, altered mental status, and cognitive slowing.
Causes
Bradydysrhythmias result from intrinsic (ie, cardiac electrical system-based) dysfunction (49%) or extrinsic causes (51%).
Intrinsic (SA and AV node dysfunction)
Aging is the most common cause
Ischemic heart disease
Infiltrative disorders
Surgery
Trauma
Extrinsic (including non-electrical system cardiac tissues)
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
Medications, illicit drugs, and toxins
Metabolic (particularly electrolyte disorders such as hyperkalemia)
Implanted pacemaker dysfunction
Infectious agents and infections
Endocrinopathies
Increased ICP
Classification
Bradyarrhythmias are classified anatomically by either the location of the dysfunction (usually SA node dysfunction and/or other areas of the myocardium taking the role of the pacemaker) or the location of the block along the electrical conduction system of the heart.
ECG can help in localizing the anatomical dysfunction or block.
In the ED, investigating the underlying clinical causes of bradyarrhythmias is a more useful approach than anatomical classification, in terms of management and treatment. Table
ECG
The ECG is the first critical step in diagnosis.
When reviewing the ECG, noting the following characteristics will aid in identification of the rhythm:
Atrial rate (P waves)
P-R interval length from beat-to-beat
Ventricular rate (QRS complex)
Association of P waves with QRS complex
Width of the QRS complex
Irregular or regular rhythm
Treatment
Treat the patient, not the number (heart rate).
Be prepared.
Perform ECG monitoring.
Obtain IV access.
Place resuscitation cart and airway equipment at bedside.
Place pacer pads on the patient’s chest.
If patient is stable, have pacing pads in place but do not activate.
If patient is unstable, initiate either atropine or TCP.
For unstable sinus bradycardia or Mobitz I, administer atropine 0.5-1 mg IV q3-5min until resolution or the maximum dose (3 mg/kg) is reached.
If atropine is ineffective or in cases of Mobitz II or third-degree AV block, initiate TCP.
If there is no response to atropine and/or TCP, administer epinephrine 20-50 µg IV bolus or epinephrine 2-10 µg/min IV infusion.
TCP
Place pads on the patient’s chest at base and apex locations (or anterior/posterior).
Activate pacing.
Adjust energy delivery of the pacing stimulus.
Start at 80 mA and reduce to the lowest energy that consistently initiates pacing.
Adjust pacing rate.
Rates of 80-100 per min are appropriate.
Determine patient response.
Electrical capture.
Pacing spike is consistently followed by a widened QRS complex.
Mechanical capture.
Patient demonstrates a palpable pulse corresponding to each electrically paced complex.
Patient’s perfusion improves.
Sedate and/or treat pain if possible for the patient’s status (perfusion and airway).
Such interventions are not always possible if the patient is in shock or has a compromised airway/breathing status.
Prepare for transvenous pacing, as TCP is only a temporary bridge to transvenous pacing or resolution of bradycardia. EM:RAP Video
A transvenous pacer is best placed by a clinician experienced in this procedure, with appropriate fluoroscopic guidance.
If such resources are not available, consider local capabilities and a potential placement using either ECG or U/S guidance. (See Chapter: Cardiac Pacing)
Management of specific situations:
If an extrinsic cause is identified, treat the underlying etiology.
Myocardial infarction (MI): Reperfusion therapy.
Electrolytes: Treat the primary derangement.
Hypothermia: Rewarming.
Sepsis: Resuscitation with IV fluids, antibiotics, and source control.
Hypoglycemia: Dextrose and manage etiology.
Intracranial hemorrhage: Management as directed by the type of hemorrhage and sequelae.
Intrinsic causes
Narrow QRS bradycardias usually have a better prognosis and frequently do not require pacing. These bradycardias are frequently vagally induced or occur as a result of a reversible cause (eg, beta blocker overdose).
Examples:
Sinus bradycardia
Other sinus node dysfunction
First-degree AV block
Second-degree AV block, type 1 (Mobitz I, Wenckebach)
Third-degree block AV block with narrow QRS complex escape
Wide QRS bradycardias are concerning for infranodal block or disease. These patients will likely need resuscitation and may potentially require permanent pacemaker placement.
Examples:
Second-degree type 2 AV block (Mobitz II) ECG
Third-degree AV block with wide QRS complex ECG
Idioventricular rhythm (ventricular escape rhythm)
Disposition
The presence of a chronotropic response (increasing heart rate with movement) is reassuring.
Discharge home can be considered when:
The patient is asymptomatic and without a concerning ECG or labs. All patients require outpatient follow-up.
Patients may benefit from outpatient monitoring.
Patients with the following features require admission:
Symptomatic (hypotension, lightheadedness, altered mental status, near syncope, angina, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness).
Bradycardia as the result of severe high degree AV block.
Underlying cause not yet reversed (ie, infections, hypothermia, hypothyroidism).
Patients should be admitted to a closely monitored setting, such as a cardiac ICU, in preparation for placement of a permanent internal pacemaker.",Bradyarrhythmias
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
In patients over 65 y of age, 1 in 600 develop sinus node dysfunction per year. 
Intrinsic causes (primary cardiac electrical system dysfunction) of bradyarrhythmia are much more common in the older adult population (age 50 y and older).
Examples in older adults: Sick sinus syndrome, Lenegre’s disease. Lev’s disease.
Example in infants: Congenital heart block in an infant born to a mother with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Extrinsic causes occur in a range of patient types and vary depending on the causative event or syndrome.
Acute coronary syndrome, particularly inferior ST-elevated myocardial infarction, is a very common cause of sinus bradycardia and AV block.
Ingestion, purposeful or accidental, of cardioactive medications and agents is another very common cause in children and adults.
Among metabolic causes, hyperkalemia is a frequent inciting factor in the development of bradycardia and should be excluded before considering other etiologies.
Pathophysiology
The cardiac electrical (conduction) system is a group of specialized cells present in the walls of the myocardium.
SA node is located in the right atrium
AV node is located in the interatrial septum
Bundle of His
Bundle branches
Purkinje fibers
Impulses originate in the SA node, resulting in atrial contraction, and then travel to the AV node. After a delay in the AV node, the signal moves to the bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje system, leading to ventricular contraction.
The SA node receives its blood supply from the SA nodal artery, which arises from the right coronary artery (RCA) in 60% of people. In the remaining 40%, the SA nodal artery arises from the left circumflex artery. 
The AV node receives its blood supply from the AV nodal branch of the RCA in 80-90% of patients and the left circumflex artery in 10% of cases.
Bradycardia occurs with abnormalities of the SA node, atrial tissue, AV node, and conduction system. 
The underlying etiology of conduction abnormalities in bradycardia can be classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic. Table
With intrinsic causes, the conductive tissue is replaced by fibrous tissue (eg, infarction, collagen vascular diseases, infection, infiltrative diseases, and surgical trauma).
Extrinsic causes are broad and include those related to autonomic dysfunction, medications and toxins, and insults to other organ systems.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Ranges from asymptomatic to shock, including impending cardiac arrest.
CO = HR x SV
When a low heart rate is no longer compensated by increases in stroke volume, the cardiac output decreases, causing symptoms. 
Hypoperfusion can result in shock, manifested by:
Hypotension with abnormal perfusion
Altered mental status
Ischemic chest pain
Pulmonary congestion (shortness of breath) 
History
Obtaining a detailed history will assist in discovering the underlying etiology of the patient’s bradycardia. Table
Physical Examination
First, assess hemodynamic stability and confirm adequate perfusion.
Reassuring findings include brisk capillary refill, strong peripheral pulses, and warm extremities.
It is imperative to obtain a core temperature (rectal preferable), especially if hypothermia is suspected.
Bradycardia due to hypothermia will not respond well to electrical impulse or atropine. In fact, pacing may be harmful because the cold cardiac membrane is unstable in hypothermia and prone to refractory ventricular fibrillation. 
The exam can also provide guidance for identifying the underlying pathology.
Heart failure
Lower extremity edema
Elevated jugular venous distention
Rales in the lower lung fields
Renal failure/impairment
Look for a dialysis catheter or fistula
Evidence of trauma (head or abdominal)
Endocrine/environmental causes
Low core temperature
Non-pitting lower extremity edema, obesity (hypothyroidism)
Electrolyte disturbances
Weakness, tremor, muscle contractions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign, dysphagia, nystagmus, psychosis, spasms, depression
ECG
ECG is the first and most critical diagnostic tool in the evaluation of the bradycardic patient.
Narrow QRS bradycardias usually have a better prognosis and do not require permanent pacemakers. These cases are usually vagally induced or the result of a reversible cause (eg, beta blocker overdose).
Patients with a second-degree AV block type II (Mobitz II), complete AV block, or ventricular pause >3 s as well as patients with wide complex bradycardias without a reversible underlying cause will usually require aggressive resuscitation and will frequently require eventual permanent pacemaker insertion by interventional cardiology.
Radiographic Evaluation
Use the clinical presentation and evaluation to guide imaging decisions.
Obtain a head CT if there is concern for increased ICP, hemorrhage, or mass.
Order a chest X-ray if there is concern for decompensated heart failure, pacemaker lead fracture or migration (See Chapter: Implanted Cardiac Devices), or evidence of sarcoidosis.
Perform a bedside U/S (ie, focused assessment with sonography in trauma exam) and CT of the abdomen if there is concern for intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)
TTE is a level-one recommendation of the ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines  for patients who are bradycardic and have the following:
Newly identified left bundle branch block
Second-degree Mobitz type II AV block
High-grade AV block or
Third-degree AV block with or without apparent structural heart disease or coronary artery disease 
TTE should be part of the initial evaluation in patients whose symptoms are suspected to be cardiac in origin (eg, MI, structural disease).
A bedside echo in the ED can be performed once the patient is stable in order to observe for cardiac motion abnormalities, valvular abnormalities, etc.
The patient may need a formal ECG study during their stay and work-up.
TTE assists with determining appropriate pacemaker capture.
TTE should also evaluate for wall motion abnormalities in the setting of suspected myocardial ischemia. Patients with symptomatic bradycardia related to cardiac ischemia will often display right ventricular wall motion abnormalities (due to the vascular supply of the SA node and moderator band). 
Laboratory Evaluation
Consider hyperkalemia early in an evaluation, and if possible, obtain bedside potassium levels.
Elevated potassium levels can present with profound bradycardia and can mimic heart blocks (especially third-degree) on an ECG. 
Examine the ECG for signs of hyperkalemia, such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, right axis deviation, and a prolonged P-R interval.
At-risk populations include patients with renal impairment, hypoperfusion states such as shock, or possible compartment syndrome.
However, no specific potassium cut-off levels are associated with bradycardia or specific ECG findings (eg, peaked T waves).
Other electrolytes
Magnesium
A level below 0.75 mmol/L is defined as hypomagnesemia. Magnesium (Mg) acts similarly to a calcium channel blocker on the myocardial membrane action potential. Furthermore, magnesium plays a role in the action of the Na/K ATPase. Depletion of magnesium renders a cell unable to retain potassium intracellularly, leading to intracellular potassium depletion.  Hypomagnesemia also affects the kidney's ability to retain potassium and results in hypokalemia. Magnesium depletion can cause arrhythmias (initially tachydysrhythmias, then bradydysrhythmias) and sudden death.
Populations at risk for hypomagnesemia include elderly patients with decreased magnesium consumption, patients on loop or thiazide diuretics, and patients with acute or chronic use of alcohol.
The ECG findings of hypomagnesemia are primarily a prolonged QT, which can lead to torsade de pointes.
Calcium
The normal concentration of total extracellular calcium is 9-10.5 mg/dL, half of which is found in the free ionized form, Ca++. The other half is protein-bound. 
A level below 8.8 mg/dL is defined as hypocalcemia. Levels above 10.5 mg/dL define hypercalcemia.
Serum calcium levels negatively correlate with the QT interval. 
Hypercalcemia is associated with short QT syndrome and arrhythmias, especially if the patient is on digoxin.
Hypocalcemia results in a prolonged ST segment and QT interval. 
Bradyarrhythmia can result from either type of calcium abnormality.
Hypocalcemia impairs myocardial contractility. The myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum does not store a large amount of calcium, and thus, it depends on extracellular calcium levels. Prolonged hypocalcemia can result in heart failure. 
Hypercalcemia has been reported to cause bradyarrhythmias as well, possibly due to calcification and dysfunction of the AV node. 
Populations at risk include patients with renal impairment, vitamin D deficiency, acute pancreatitis, magnesium deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, post total thyroidectomy, or cancer.
Glucose
Hypoglycemia alters the physiology of the myocardium. It has proarrhythmic effects and prolongs the QTc, which can lead to torsades de pointes. Hypoglycemia can also induce hypokalemia, which further causes arrhythmias and can lead to sudden death. 
One study showed that 47% of patients with type 2 diabetes who presented with severe hypoglycemia had hypokalemia as well. The median level of blood glucose in that study was 34 mg/dL thyroid-stimulating hormone. 
Hypothyroidism can cause sinus node dysfunction, AV blocks, and even torsade de pointes. 
Check blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, as patients with acute and chronic renal failure are at high risk of electrolyte imbalances.
Other labs should be guided by clinical presentation:
Troponins, CK, muscle/brain CK, myoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), or N-terminal-proBNP if there is concern for cardiac ischemia or other cardiac disease.
Serum drug levels (eg, digoxin).
Infectious titers (rapid plasma reagin for syphilis or Lyme).
Therapeutic Considerations
Management of bradydysrhythmias is based on various factors including patient stability, severity of symptoms, and the risk of progression to third-degree AV block or asystole. 
When treating a patient with bradyarrhythmia, it is paramount to determine the following:
If the patient is stable or unstable.
“Unstable” is defined by any of the following: hypotension, decreased level of consciousness, ischemic chest pain or anginal equivalent, or acute heart failure.
If any of the above are presumed to be due to bradycardia, then the patient is assumed to have an “unstable bradyarrhythmia” and requires immediate treatment.
The ECG rhythm.
The underlying cause of the bradyarrhythmia.
Management of bradyarrhythmia depends on the underlying etiology. Table
Managing the Patient with Unstable Bradyarrhythmia
Unstable patients are generally defined as patients with hypotension with poor perfusion, altered mental status, ischemic chest pain, and dyspnea from acute heart failure. These patients likely require urgent intervention to improve perfusion. 
If patient is unstable, initiate either atropine or TCP.
Atropine 0.5-1 mg IV q3-5min until resolution or the maximum dose (3 mg) is reached, should be used for unstable sinus bradycardia or Mobitz I.
TCP should be used if atropine is ineffective or for Mobitz II or third-degree AV block.
Patients may respond to atropine with total higher initial (eg, 1 mg) and maximal doses (3 mg).
Atropine is vagolytic and will only affect the SA node and proximal AV node. Bradyarrhythmias below the AV will not respond well to atropine (wide QRS).
Atropine is unlikely to benefit post-cardiac transplant patients and should be avoided. 
If there is no response to atropine and/or TCP, administer epinephrine 20-50 µg IV bolus or epinephrine 2-10 µg/min infusion.
TCP serves as a bridge to more definitive therapy or an improvement in the patient’s condition. Pacing pads should be placed on the patient regardless of whether pacing is immediately indicated.
Pharmacotherapy
Atropine is a reasonable first choice.
Administer atropine 0.5-1 mg IV q3-5min until resolution or the maximum dose (3 mg) is reached.
Atropine is an anticholinergic medication that works by parasympathetic blockade and direct vagolytic action.  Some conditions (eg, heart transplant, hypothermia, some Mobitz II, third-degree heart block cases) will have a poor response to atropine; for this reason, epinephrine is recommended as the first-line drug of choice in these situations.
Epinephrine is a reasonable second-choice agent.
Administer epinephrine 20-50 µg IV bolus or epinephrine 2-10 µg/min IV infusion or atropine IV 0.5-1 mg if epinephrine is not readily available. Epinephrine exerts both positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart; unlike atropine, it exerts its effect directly on the myocardium.
Consider isoproterenol as a third-line agent. It is a pure beta agonist (beta 1 and beta 2) and exerts its effects directly on the myocardium.
Isoproterenol, if available, 2-10 µg/min IV, titrate to effect.
In ACS presentations, isoproterenol can exacerbate the ischemic process.
As stabilization occurs, efforts should be made to identify, diagnose, and reverse the underlying cause.  Once the cause is identified, immediately initiate therapy for the specific condition(s) to improve bradyarrhythmia and increase cardiac output.
Managing the Stable Bradyarrhythmia Patient
Stable patients are asymptomatic with a normal blood pressure and no signs of heart failure, altered mental status, chest pain, or lightheadedness.
The underlying cause of bradyarrhythmia should be identified; this may occur in either an inpatient or outpatient setting.
Caution is advised for severely bradycardic and normotensive patients.
Endogenous sympathetic responses result in vasoconstriction.
Patients may have a low cardiac output and be in shock despite a ‘normal’ blood pressure. Always consider the following indicators of instability and potential shock:
Hypotension with abnormal perfusion
Altered mental status
Ischemic chest pain
Pulmonary congestion (shortness of breath) 
Avoid treating hypertension in patients with severe bradycardia and hypertension. Vasodilation can lead to hemodynamic collapse.
Other Pharmacologic Considerations
Dobutamine is an effective beta agonist but has vasodilatory effects and should be avoided in the hypotensive, crashing bradycardic patient.
Dopamine has chronotropic properties and can be used if other agents are unavailable or ineffective.
Dopamine has potent vasoconstrictive effects and may cause skin necrosis with extravasation.
Intralipids should be considered in cases of bradyarrhythmia due to medication toxicities such as lidocaine infusion or in patients with recent nerve blocks, beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker toxicity/overdose, etc. Table
Disposition
Decisions regarding patient disposition should be based on the etiology of the underlying cause of bradydysrhythmias and the overall patient condition.
Discharge
Patients with non-concerning, extrinsic bradydysrhythmia causes may be discharged if the patient is asymptomatic with normal vital signs and the underlying cause has been reversed (eg, drug overdose, vagal stimulation, hypoxia).
Patients need clear follow-up and discharge instructions (eg, do not strain while defecating, discontinue a certain medication until follow-up, etc.).
Hospital Admission
Most intrinsic bradydysrhythmias will require hospital admission, as they are frequently not readily reversible and require additional specialized management of the underlying condition. Insertion of a permanent pacemaker is the definitive treatment.
Symptomatic patients (ie, hypotensive, altered mental status, chest pain, etc.) with intrinsic or extrinsic causes, as well as those with unresolved underlying conditions, should be admitted to a closely monitored setting.",Bradyarrhythmias
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
PREPARATION
Don PPE before entering the room
Gather only the necessary personnel and equipment and assign resuscitation team roles before the patient arrives.
Utilize team dynamics:
Organize a rotation of personnel to ensure continuous chest compressions.
Vocalize thought processes and utilize closed-loop communication.
Ensure crowd control.
The mnemonic “CAB” (circulation, airway, breathing) has replaced the original “ABC” in the approach to adult cardiac arrest.
CIRCULATION
Ensure adequate vascular access.
Apply monitoring and defibrillation pads.
Assess for a pulse (≤10 s) and initiate high-quality chest compressions if the pulse is absent.
Depth: 5-6 cm (2-2.3 in)
Rate: 100-120 bpm
Allow for appropriate chest recoil
Minimize interruptions in chest compressions
Invasive procedures should not interrupt chest compressions or interfere with defibrillation attempts.
AIRWAY/BREATHING
Utilize an oral airway with a non-rebreather mask until a more definitive airway can be established.
Control respirations at a rate of 8-12 bpm.
DEFIBRILLATION
Defibrillation should be performed immediately upon the diagnosis of a shockable ventricular rhythm.
Chest compressions should be performed in the pulseless patient while the defibrillator and monitor are being set up, but as soon as a shockable rhythm is noted on the monitor, defibrillate!
There is no need to provide 2 min of chest compressions for unwitnessed cardiac arrest or for cardiac arrest of unknown duration prior to defibrillation.
Continue to reassess the rhythm every 2 min after this, and defibrillate for shockable rhythms.
Use the manufacturer-recommended energy levels for defibrillation
If unknown, use the device’s maximum energy.
The minimum energy for the first shock is typically at least 150 J. For pulsed biphasic waveforms, begin at 120-150 J.
Increase energy if needed, and provide 2 min of compressions between defibrillations.
Resume chest compressions immediately after defibrillation without waiting for a pulse check.
If possible, charge the defibrillator during compressions while awaiting the next rhythm check in 2 min; this helps to minimize the “hands-off” time (during which the patient is receiving no compressions) around the time of the subsequent shocks.
PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY
Administer epinephrine 1 mg intravenous (IV)/intraosseous as soon as feasible. Redose with 1 mg epinephrine every 5 min.
Early administration of epinephrine is particularly encouraged in pulseless electrical activity/asystole presentations.
Administer amiodarone 300 mg IV/intraosseous for resistant ventricular dysrhythmias.
Vasopressin, atropine, sodium bicarbonate, calcium, high-dose epinephrine, thrombolytics, and resuscitative fluids are not recommended for routine use in all patients; niche application of these and other agents is possible. Clinical context and suspected/known etiology of cardiac arrest should guide the use of these medications.
EM:RAP Link
EM:RAP Audio: 2017 October - Cardiology Corner – What REALLY Works in Cardiac Arrest
Key Concepts
Cardiac arrest is characterized by loss of consciousness, apnea, and the absence of a palpable pulse, resulting from an insufficient cardiac output to deliver oxygen to vital organs.
PITFALLS
Note that agonal respirations (ie, deep, slow breaths at a rate of 1-2/min) frequently occur in the first minutes of cardiac arrest and should not be mistaken as a sign indicating cardiac activity!
High-quality basic life support (BLS) is the cornerstone of resuscitation. Evidence in support of other advanced life support interventions has varied over time.
Resuscitation should focus on two simultaneous goals:
(1) restoration of circulation and
(2) identification and correction of the underlying etiology of cardiopulmonary collapse.
Approximately 20% of initial rhythms in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are shockable (ventricular fibrillation [VF] and pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VT]). Coronary artery disease, structural heart disease, and genetic or stimulant-related etiologies are the most common cardiogenic presentations.
Diagnosis
Cardiac arrest is the loss of functional cardiac mechanical activity combined with an absence of systemic circulation. It is the final common pathway of all life-threatening disease, rendering detection of the precipitating etiology difficult. Table
Review the medical record, if readily available, to establish comorbidities and medications. Elicit historical events preceding the cardiac arrest from bystanders and emergency medical services (EMS). This information typically provides the most useful diagnostic clues to the underlying etiology. In some cases, this information is not readily available.
Age-based etiologies
Up to 80% of cases involve coronary artery disease (CAD) or a structural cardiac defect, which are more common in the elderly.
40% of young patients (≤35 y old) have structurally normal hearts, with the etiology related to a hereditary or acquired dysrhythmia.
Physical examination
Patient is pulseless, unconscious, and unresponsive.
Agonal breathing (slow, deep breathing) may be present and does not automatically preclude pulselessness.
Chest compressions and defibrillation are appropriate for a patient with cardiac arrest and agonal respiration.
Detection of agonal breathing is associated with improved clinical outcomes.
Assess for:
Evidence of trauma or other environmental injury
Signs of bleeding
Abdominal distention or palpable mass
Implanted medical devices and catheters
Recent surgical incisions
Sudden, severe hypothermia
Focused ultrasound assessment is useful to identify potentially treatable etiologies of cardiac arrest in cases of pulseless electrical activity.
Focused laboratory evaluation can further assist in diagnosis.
Treatment
When possible, assign repetitive tasks to machines or other healthcare staff.
Circulation
Administer high-quality chest compressions after confirmation of pulselessness:
Depth: 5-6 cm (2-2.3 in)
Rate: 100-120 bpm
Chest compression fraction: >80%
Full chest recoil allowed between compressions
Palms centered over mid-sternum
Centered over the middle of the chest; do not lean and allow full recoil
Brief, focused pauses to rapidly accomplish a specific task (eg, pulse check, shock delivery, airway placement)
A sufficiently rigid surface beneath the patient
Minimize interruptions in chest compressions
PEARLS
Ultrasound techniques for minimizing chest compression interruptions include the following:
Capture and save video clips of cardiac views during pulse checks.
Assign a dedicated clinician to review the video clips for further details after compressions are resumed.
Continue compressions through lung and abdominal sonographic evaluations.
Provide situation awareness by assigning a team member to state out loud the time elapsed during interruptions.
Mechanical chest compression devices
Do not improve clinical outcomes in all resuscitation situations.
Are appropriate for use in medically austere environments (out-of-hospital and hospital-based with limited resources).
Are appropriate as a bridge to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and other invasive procedures.
Oxygenation and ventilation
Ensure a patent airway:
Insert oral or nasal adjunct airway.
If intubation is not immediately available, ventilate with a bag-mask and a HEPA filter using the 2-person technique to obtain a firm seal at 10 breaths per minute
Avoid hyperventilation.
Confirm fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 100% during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Defer advanced airway maneuvers until later in the resuscitation or after return of spontaneous circulation unless basic airway maneuvers are insufficient to secure the airway, provide respirations, or prevent aspiration.
Assign the most experienced provider to maximize the likelihood of first-pass success.
Supraglottic airways are often sufficient to rapidly establish a patent airway and to facilitate gas exchange without interruption of chest compressions.
Do not interrupt chest compressions or defibrillation.
Upon establishing an advanced airway, attach end-tidal waveform capnometer.
Changes in quantitative end-tidal CO2 can guide resuscitative interventions.
Sustained normal or near-normal (≥20 mm Hg) values suggest acceptable circulation from chest compressions.
A sudden increase suggests return of spontaneous circulation.
A sudden decrease suggests loss of airway patency.
A gradual decrease suggests inadequate circulation (eg, compressor fatigue over time, uncontrolled hemorrhage).
Suggested initial mechanical ventilator settings:
Volume assist-control
Tidal volume: 6 mL/kg
Peak flow: 30 L/min
Peak pressure limit: 100 cm H2O 
Respiratory rate: 10; positive end expiratory pressure: 0; fraction of inspired O2: 100%
Vascular Access
Insert at least 2 large-bore (≥18-gauge peripheral IV) lines or at least 1 intraosseous line with good flow.
Central venous catheter
Central venous catheter placement rarely adds diagnostic or therapeutic value during cardiac arrest.
Central venous catheter placement attempts frequently adversely impact chest compressions and defibrillation.
Non-sterile lines are a potential source of infection and will require replacement when the patient is more stable.
Intraosseous lines can be more easily and rapidly placed than peripheral and central IV lines.
PERSPECTIVES
Monitoring resuscitation for return of spontaneous circulation via arterial line should be considered cautiously given its potential to interrupt quality CPR. EM:RAP Audio
Medications
Vasopressors
Administer epinephrine 1 mg IV/orally every 3-5 min
Prioritize timely epinephrine administration especially in cases with non-shockable rhythms.
Administer antidysrhythmics for persistent VF or pulseless VT after 2-3 defibrillation attempts.
Refractory ventricular dysrhythmias
Amiodarone 5 mg/kg (up to 300 mg) IV bolus or lidocaine 1.0-1.5 mg/kg (up to 100 mg) IV bolus may be given to stabilize the myocardium and is particularly useful in patients with witnessed arrests.
A second dose of amiodarone (up to 150 mg) IV bolus or lidocaine 0.5-0.75 mg/kg IV bolus may be given for persistent VF or pulseless VT.
Esmolol: 500 μg/kg IV bolus over 1 min followed by IV infusion of 50 µg/kg/min continuous infusion, may titrate upward by 25-50 µg/kg/min to a maximum of 100 µg/kg/min.
Double Sequential Defibrillation
Utilize identical models and pads.
Apply pads in anterior–posterior and base–apex positioning.
Limited data support this intervention.
Exercise caution due to potential defibrillator damage.
Invasive coronary angiography/percutaneous revascularization
Requires a mechanical chest compression device.
Extracorporeal CPR/ECMO
Available at select institutions (See Chapter: ECMO)
ECMO requires massive resource and time requirements and is not appropriate for the vast majority of cardiac arrest patients
Termination considerations
No single factor reliably predicts failure to achieve sustained return of spontaneous circulation.
For prehospital cases, the Universal Termination of Resuscitation Guidelines have been validated in multiple settings and carry the lowest risk of premature termination if the patient has had at least four 2-minute cycles of CPR. Subjects must meet all 3 criteria for resuscitation to be terminated prior to transportation to a hospital:
Unwitnessed by EMS or bystander
No automated external defibrillator or defibrillator shock delivered
No return of spontaneous circulation despite resuscitation attempts
PERSPECTIVES
In the emergency department (ED) or other hospital-based settings, multiple parameters are considered in the decision to terminate resuscitation.
Parameters include case-specific features, such as elapsed duration of resuscitation, cardiac rhythm, sustained end-tidal CO2 <10 mm Hg, identification of an irreversible etiology, unresponsiveness to resuscitative interventions, and patient-specific features, such as age, comorbidities, and advanced directives.
PEARLS
After 20 min of resuscitation, end-tidal CO2 values of ≤10 mm Hg are strongly associated with unsuccessful resuscitation.
Involve healthcare team members in the decision to terminate resuscitation.
Ensure excellent nursing and comfort care.
Contact the local organ procurement organization for evaluation of candidacy for organ or tissue donation.
Special Circumstances
COVID-19 (See Chapter: Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19))
The interim guidelines emphasize protecting the caregivers and minimizing the risks from aerosol-generating procedures. 
Minimize the number of healthcare workers at the bedside. Multiple jobs may have to be performed by the same provider
Apply passive oxygenation via non-rebreather with facemask cover to limit aerosolization while compressing. Avoid bag-mask ventilation unless the patient is in a negative pressure room, a HEPA filter is applied and a tight seal is achieved.
To reduce the number of personnel providing chest compressions, utilize a mechanical compression device, if available.
Assess rhythm and defibrillate prior to intubation.
Prepare for immediate intubation with first-pass success using videolaryngoscopy to minimize exposure to the aerosols generated by intubation.
Ensure a HEPA filter is attached to the end of the endotracheal tube prior to any ventilation
Consider appropriateness of starting or continuing resuscitation
Much of the guidance provided regarding timing of intubation and defibrillation priorities in the COVID-19 era is based on expert opinion.
Prone patients
In the non-intubated patient, supinate the patient and perform chest compressions.
In the intubated patient, given the risk of endotracheal tube dislodgement, chest compressions may be performed by pressing on the T7-10 vertebrae.
Apply the defibrillator pads in the anterior-posterior position
Precordial thump
Consider for witnessed and monitored VF when defibrillation is not immediately available. With VT, deterioration to VF is possible due to R-on-T phenomenon. 
Begin chest compressions if not immediately successful.
Pregnant female (See Chapter: Trauma in Pregnancy)
Manually displace gravid uterus to the left to facilitate venous return.
Perform perimortem C-section if return of spontaneous circulation is not achieved within 4 min.
Continue attempts to resuscitate both mother and child.
Traumatic/hemorrhagic arrest (See Chapter: Blunt Thoracic Trauma)
Focus on hemorrhage control, blood product administration, and reversal of obstructive causes of shock.
Acute myocardial infarction (See Chapter: Acute Coronary Syndrome)
Focus on supporting circulation as a bridge to coronary revascularization.
Massive pulmonary embolism (See Chapter: Venous Thromboembolism)
Focus on supporting circulation as a bridge to fibrinolysis.

Background
Epidemiology
The approximate incidence of sudden cardiac arrest is 34.4 per 100,000 person-years in Europe, 53.1 per 100,000 person-years in North America, and 59.4 per 100,000 person-years in Asia. 
EMS-assessed incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is 110.8/100,000 (95% confidence interval: 108.9-112.6) for any age in the United States and 140.7/100,000 for adults. 
Potential sources of systematic error in the estimation of incidence:
Death certificates tend to overestimate sudden cardiac arrest as the cause of unexpected death.
EMS systems do not respond to or attempt resuscitation in all out-of-hospital deaths.
Most (70%) adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases occur in a private residence. The remainder tend to occur in public settings (19%) or nursing homes (12%).
Half (51%) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases are unwitnessed.
The proportion of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases with an initially shockable rhythm is declining over time. In 2017, only 19% of EMS-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases had an initially shockable cardiac rhythm.
The three prehospital factors associated with the highest probability of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are:
Witnessed collapse
Bystander CPR
Automated external defibrillator utilization (for a shockable rhythm)
When these three features are present, up to 60% of patients survive, but substantial systemic disparities exist, leading to an overall witnessed shockable rhythm survival of 35%. 
Survival to hospital discharge has increased over time in the United States (5.7% in 2005; 10.4% in 2018). As of 2018, 8.2% of patients survived with a favorable neurological outcome. 
Sports-related sudden cardiac arrest
More likely to be witnessed and exhibit an initially shockable cardiac rhythm, but less likely to result from known heart disease.
In a prospective French study from 2005 to 2010, the majority of non-traumatic sports-related deaths occurred in middle-aged, non-competitive participants, especially among men who cycle and jog. 
Sports-related cases account for 5% of sudden cardiac arrests in middle-aged individuals (35-65 y) compared with 39% of cases in youth ≤18 y. 
The most common etiologies of sudden cardiac arrests in young athletes include the following: 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (36%)
Coronary artery anomalies (19%)
Myocarditis (7%)
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (5%)
CAD (4%)
Commotio cordis (3%)
Some regions advocate electrocardiography (ECG) screening of young athletes participating in competitive sports.
Pathophysiology
Cardiac arrest is the final common pathway of all life-threatening conditions.
Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity, resulting in the absence of circulation, oxygen delivery, and metabolite removal. Loss of these functions is only partially attenuated by CPR.
In the absence of circulation, intravascular thrombosis occurs in the microvascular circulation, which poses challenges to restoring cerebral perfusion after return of spontaneous circulation in the macrocirculation.
The combination of impaired oxygen delivery and compensatory increase in tissue oxygen extraction during CPR leads to a significant reduction in central venous oxygen saturation.
With a decline in adenosine triphosphate production, cell membrane integrity deteriorates, with an influx of sodium and calcium and an efflux of potassium. Mitochondrial injury follows, leading to increased nitric oxide production and free radical formation.
The brain is uniquely vulnerable to these ischemic insults.
The precipitating etiology of cardiac arrest is superimposed on these complex cellular injuries.
Cardiac Etiology (cardiogenic cardiac arrest)
Up to 65%-70% of sudden cardiac deaths are attributable to CAD, accounting for 30%-50% of deaths in patients with heart failure. 
Among adults, particularly women, sudden cardiac death may be the first manifestation of CAD.
Approximately 10% of sudden cardiac deaths are attributable to structural heart disease. In patients younger than 30 y, up to 35% have a structural etiology, including congenital coronary artery anomalies, aortic dissection, infiltrative cardiomyopathies (eg, amyloidosis and sarcoidosis), dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, inflammatory myocarditis, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
Among sudden cardiac death cases, 5%-10% are associated with non-structural arrhythmias, including long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome.
Additionally, cocaine, amphetamines, and rarely acute non-toxicological stress can result in catecholaminergic polymorphic VT.
Non-cardiac Etiology (non-cardiogenic cardiac arrest)
Approximately 15%-25% of cardiac arrest cases have a non-cardiac etiology.
These causes include but are not limited to trauma, hemorrhage, drug intoxication, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, drowning, central airway obstruction, sepsis, environmental injury, dehydration/malnutrition, and hypoxemia.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Prompt recognition of cardiac arrest remains challenging for both lay persons and healthcare providers.
Residual agonal breathing or gasping is often present immediately after collapse, which can delay the recognition of cardiac arrest. 
Myoclonic jerks or a brief generalized seizure may be the initial manifestation of cardiac arrest. These events can confuse the lay provider and delay the application of lifesaving BLS care.
Patients who are unresponsive and not breathing normally have a high probability of being in cardiac arrest.
Healthcare providers should spend no more than 10 s checking for a pulse. If no definitive pulse is found, begin chest compressions.
Laboratory Evaluation
Laboratory testing during cardiac arrest is rarely beneficial.
In select situations, bedside point-of-care testing may be useful to identify specific metabolic etiologies of cardiac arrest (eg, severe acidemia, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, severe anemia).
Point-of-care glucose testing should be interpreted with caution because a fingerstick glucose reading obtained from a poorly perfused finger may be unreliable.
End-tidal waveform capnography measures exhaled carbon dioxide, which not only confirms correct airway placement but also estimates the underlying cellular metabolism.
End-tidal waveform capnography should only be used with an advanced airway in place that exhibits no air leak. In addition to confirming a patent airway, quantitative waveform capnography can guide minute ventilation and chest compression parameters to sustain normal or near-normal values (≥20 mm Hg) and offers ancillary evidence of return of spontaneous circulation if an abrupt increase is noted.
Conversely, steadily declining values may indicate a loss of adequate perfusion from hemorrhage or compressor fatigue, and abruptly declining values may indicate displacement of the tube with a loss of airway.
Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may initially exhibit artificially elevated end-tidal CO2 values.
Radiographic Evaluation
Ultrasound
Focused bedside ultrasound is available in many hospitals, but transthoracic cardiac views typically necessitate an interruption in chest compressions that has been shown to double the recommended 10-s duration of pulse check time. 
Ultrasound techniques for minimizing chest compression interruptions include capturing and saving video clips of cardiac views during pulse checks and assigning a dedicated clinician to review the video clips for further details after compressions are resumed. Compressions may be continued through lung and abdominal sonographic evaluations. Provide situation awareness by assigning a team member to state out loud the time elapsed during interruptions. 
Ultrasound is useful to evaluate for specific treatable etiologies of cardiac arrest, especially in pulseless electrical activity, including pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, massive pulmonary embolism, regional wall motion abnormalities, aortic dissection or aneurysm with rupture, and intra-thoracic or abdominal bleeding. 
Transesophageal echocardiography obviates the need for chest compression interruption and may play a larger role in cardiac arrest management, but requires additional training with local credentialing processes. 
The transesophageal probe adds an additional expense beyond that of standard ultrasound probes. In addition to screening for treatable etiologies of cardiac arrest, transesophageal echocardiography may provide real-time guidance for hand placement during external chest compressions to optimize cardiac output. 
Transesophageal echocardiography currently plays a very small role in cardiac arrest resuscitation.
Therapeutic Considerations
Prehospital Interventions
Several prehospital interventions affect the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation, survival, and neurological outcome. Because the typical EMS response interval for cardiac arrest is 9-10 min in urban and suburban environments, the initiation of BLS (CPR and automated external defibrillator use) often falls to bystanders. 
Bystander CPR (typically compression-only CPR) and public access defibrillation are critical for neurologically intact survival.
Dispatchers should direct bystanders to perform compressions via telephone instructions.
Physicians have a professional responsibility to support these prehospital and bystander CPR efforts and public automated external defibrillator usage. 
It is feasible to “crowd-source” the initiation of BLS to a pool of lay-person first responders notified by short message service (SMS) messaging or smartphone geolocation. 
Utilizing law enforcement as first responders can also reduce the interval between collapse and the onset of BLS. 
Bystander CPR can markedly improve survival rates and neurological outcomes (number needed to treat ~15), but the extent of public CPR training varies across countries (18% in the United States, 90% in Norway, 61% in the United Kingdom). 
Simple instruction of compression-only CPR can be as brief as a 1-min video. 
During activation of the emergency response system, dispatcher-assisted CPR increases both the likelihood of the occurrence of bystander CPR and survival. Ongoing quality improvement is required by dispatchers to maintain this skill set. 
Public access defibrillation:
Automated external defibrillators are used by lay providers in approximately 11% of EMS-treated cardiac arrest cases. When used, automated external defibrillators are associated with survival rates of 40%-75% for subjects with an initially shockable cardiac rhythm (number needed to treat ~5). 
Unfortunately, the majority (70%-80%) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases occur in the home or other non-public locations.
The prevalence of automated external defibrillator registries is increasing worldwide due to efforts to account for the location of all known automated external defibrillators in a particular geographic region. 
Team Dynamics in the ED
EM:RAP: July 2018 - Team Based CPR EM:RAP Audio
Utilize team-based, high-quality CPR. High-quality CPR is characterized by the measurement of specific high-quality CPR metrics, including the following: 
Chest compression depth, rate, and fraction
Duration of pauses between bouts of compressions (including peri-shock pause)
Chest wall recoil
Ventilation parameters (tidal volume and respiratory rate)
Review of performance related to these metrics enables effective remediation, retraining, and improvement. 
Team leaders should utilize “transparent thinking,” which helps team members, especially those in ad hoc teams, to anticipate each other’s actions. Transparent thinking entails vocalizing observations and considerations for the benefit of team members in order to address barriers to desired actions, set expectations, and coordinate team efforts to achieve a specific goal. 
Principles of effective leadership include making orienting remarks and inviting contributions. When a problem is perceived, ask questions that promote information exchange. Rather than performing bedside tasks, the team leader should assign specific tasks using clear affirmative statements, while simultaneously monitoring adherence to the desired treatment. 
Communicate actionable information, verbalize specific findings, and encourage questions and information sharing.
Do not prematurely anchor on a single etiology of cardiac arrest. Verify crucial data and verbalize uncertainties. Ask team members for their observations. Any changes in team leadership or patient status should be stated aloud.
Restoring Circulation
Without blood flow, external chest compressions are required to generate blood circulation to the heart, brain, and other vital organs.
Coronary perfusion pressure is the pressure gradient between the aorta and left ventricle at the end of diastole.
Myocardial perfusion occurs during diastole when the ventricular pressure is low.
Coronary perfusion pressure is correlated with myocardial perfusion, restoration of myocardial metabolic substrate, and ultimately the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation. 
Successive chest compressions dynamically increase the coronary perfusion pressure by building a pressure gradient between the aorta and left ventricle during diastole.
Ineffective chest compressions or pauses in chest compressions undermine this pressure gradient. 
Thus, the emphasis on high-quality chest compressions with minimal to no pauses is driven by the underlying hemodynamics of CPR and coronary perfusion pressure.
Depth: 5-6 cm
Rate: 100-120 bpm
Chest compression fraction: 80%
Palms centered over mid/lower half of the sternum but superior to the xiphoid process
Full chest recoil allowed between compressions
Centered over the middle of the chest; do not lean
Brief, focused pauses to rapidly accomplish a specific task (eg, pulse check, shock delivery, airway placement, bedside ultrasound)
A sufficiently rigid surface beneath the patient
The quantity and duration of pauses can be easily determined by calculating the chest compression fraction; that is, the proportion of resuscitation time during which chest compressions occur. Monitoring of chest compression interruptions is associated with an improved survival of in-hospital cardiac arrest.
Mechanical chest compression devices
With its ability to reliably deliver continuous, high-quality chest compressions with minimal to no interruptions, a mechanical chest compression device is theoretically a very desirable tool.
Both piston-type and circumferential band-type devices are commercially available.
Several randomized trials of these devices have demonstrated a lack of benefit for mechanical CPR over manual CPR with respect to survival or neurological outcome.
The theoretical benefit of sustained mechanical compressions may be offset by the initial time required to apply and secure the device, during which no compressions occur.
Acknowledging the lack of demonstrable benefit in clinical outcomes from randomized trials, mechanical chest compression devices may still be useful in certain circumstances, such as the following:
Limited personnel in out-of-hospital and in-hospital resuscitations
Prolonged prehospital transport interval
As a bridge to a specific destination therapy treating the underlying etiology of cardiac arrest (eg, resistant VF, coronary revascularization, fibrinolysis of a massive pulmonary embolism, reversing a specific toxidrome). 
Extracorporeal CPR (See Chapter: ECMO)
Extracorporeal circulatory support is an invasive option for augmenting circulation during cardiac arrest.
Through cannulation of a large vein and artery (typically femoral vessels), venoarterial ECMO enables oxygen delivery, carbon dioxide removal, and mechanical circulatory support during cardiac arrest.
Extracorporeal CPR has generated much enthusiasm but remains a resource-intensive intervention that is susceptible to complications and is available only in select healthcare settings.
A recent systematic review of extracorporeal CPR found inconclusive evidence regarding its use for cardiac arrest in adults.
To date, no randomized trials of extracorporeal CPR have been performed in any setting.
Observational, retrospective studies of extracorporeal CPR suffer from selection bias, confounding, and inconsistent findings.
These studies should not be used as a justification for widespread program implementation.
Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of extracorporeal CPR for cardiac arrest. For settings in which it can be rapidly implemented, extracorporeal CPR is a treatment option for select patients with a reversible cause of cardiac arrest and with limited requirements expected for mechanical circulatory support. 
Iatrogenic injuries
Patients with return of spontaneous circulation should be evaluated for iatrogenic injuries from chest compressions. The most common injuries are rib (~30%) and sternal (~15%) fractures, most of which are not detected by conventional chest X-ray. 
Consider evaluation for traumatic pneumothorax because this can contribute to cardiovascular compromise, especially in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
More serious cardiac, vascular, thoracic, and abdominal injuries have been well described and are more common than many clinicians suspect. 
Some studies advocate whole-body computed tomography imaging after return of spontaneous circulation to screen for iatrogenic injuries and to search for underlying etiologies of cardiac arrest. 
Airway
Unconsciousness typically results in airway obstruction.
A patent airway is required for gas exchange during CPR.
Depending on patient anatomy, environmental factors, and clinical context, an airway may be established via a basic airway strategy (anatomic repositioning with an oral or nasal airway adjunct and bag-mask ventilation) or an advanced airway strategy (supraglottic airway placement or tracheal intubation).
Both bag-mask ventilation and advanced airway management are defined skills that require specific training and clinical experience to achieve and maintain proficiency.
Limited evidence suggests that cardiogenic (directly the result of a cardiac issue) and non-cardiogenic (non-cardiac issue) cardiac arrest events should be approached differently regarding airway management.
Cardiogenic cardiac arrest:
An oxygen reserve exists
Minimal acidosis and limited to no waste product accumulation is present
Early (within 4-8 min) airway management is not a priority
Non-cardiogenic cardiac arrest:
An oxygen deficit is likely present with significant acidosis
Waste product accumulation is present
Early airway management can be a priority
Initial airway strategy
When an advanced airway is required and the provider has limited experience or training in tracheal intubation, a supraglottic airway is a more prudent selection.
For providers with significant experience and training in tracheal intubation, either a supraglottic airway or tracheal intubation may be utilized.
Providers should also consider the goal of minimizing interruptions to chest compressions when selecting an advanced airway strategy. In this regard, a supraglottic airway may offer an advantage over tracheal intubation.
Existing evidence:
No randomized trials have compared the initial strategy of bag-mask ventilation vs. initial supraglottic airway insertion.
Three recent prospective randomized trials conducted in different EMS systems with a range of intubation success rates (52%-98%) compared various advanced airway strategies and bag-mask ventilation. Subjects randomized to advanced airways were subject to a variable period of bag-mask ventilation during preparation for device insertion, and at least one trial explicitly allowed crossover between interventions at the clinical discretion of prehospital providers. 
Even in settings with high tracheal intubation success rates, there is currently no evidence indicating that an advanced airway (either supraglottic airway or tracheal intubation) during CPR improves survival or neurological outcome after adult cardiac arrest compared with bag-mask ventilation. 
The rationale for transitioning from a basic to advanced airway strategy is highly dependent on the clinical context, including patient anatomy, aspiration risk, and oxygenation and ventilation success. If an advanced airway strategy is used, providers should choose an advanced airway strategy based on their particular skill set (ILCOR CoSTR). 
Gas exchange
Accounting for anatomic dead space, chest compressions alone typically do not generate sufficient passive air movement to facilitate gas exchange.
The need for gas exchange must be balanced with the inevitable interruption in chest compressions for the delivery of synchronized breaths.
With an advanced airway in place, oxygenation and ventilation can occur in parallel with chest compressions.
Some artificial respiration is required during cardiac arrest. In the absence of an advanced airway, a compression:ventilation ratio of 30:2 has been the historical recommendation since 2005. Prior to 2005, the recommendation of 15:2 was associated with lower survival rates.
Oxygen concentration
Both the “no-flow” state of cardiac arrest and the “low-flow” state of CPR are characterized by central venous hypoxemia and insufficient oxygen delivery, manifested as an oxygen debt in the post-resuscitation phase.
Use the highest available oxygen concentration during CPR. Upon achieving sustained return of spontaneous circulation, titration of supplemental oxygen is recommended to maintain normoxia. (See Chapter: Post-Arrest Care)
Defibrillation
Transthoracic electric rescue shocks convert ventricular dysrhythmias to an organized cardiac rhythm by depolarizing the myocardium, cancelling the original wavefronts, or prolonging the refractory period.
Initial rescue shocks should be delivered at the lowest effective manufacturer-recommended energy setting while minimizing the number of unsuccessful shocks, as repeated shocks may damage the myocardium.
Biphasic shock waveforms more effectively depolarize the myocardium and require less energy than monophasic shock waveforms.
Successful defibrillation hinges on the delivery of an adequate electrical current to the myocardium.
Transthoracic impedance indicates the opposition of the thorax to the electrical circuit created when a current is applied to the patient during defibrillation.
A higher transthoracic impedance is associated with a greater body weight, larger body surface area, larger thoracic diameter, and smaller pad/paddle surface area.
Defibrillation success rates are influenced by peri-shock pause length and the quality of chest compressions. Longer pre-shock pauses and shallow compressions are associated with lower defibrillation success rates. 
The VF waveform is a dynamic entity that is quantitatively analyzed by amplitude, frequency, and nonlinear organization.
Immediately after cardiac arrest, VF waveforms are typically large in amplitude and appear visually “coarse,” whereas they are typically smaller in amplitude and have a “fine” appearance later after cardiac arrest.  
This quantitative deterioration in VF corresponds to the consumption of high-energy phosphates and metabolic substrate within the myocardium.
Chest compressions that generate a sufficient coronary perfusion pressure to recirculate the metabolic substrate quantitatively restore the degraded VF to a more robust appearance.
In retrospective analyses, the probability of defibrillation success has been directly associated with the “coarseness” of the VF. No prospective human studies have specifically evaluated whether treatment altered by predicting the success of defibrillation can improve defibrillation success or clinical outcomes. 
Defibrillation attempts usually include unavoidable pauses in chest compressions.
The total duration of pauses both before (while the defibrillator is charging) and after (during a post-shock rhythm/pulse check) shock delivery is inversely associated with successful clinical outcomes.
To minimize chest compression interruptions, the defibrillator should be charged during chest compressions, and chest compressions should resume immediately after shock delivery.
Post-shock rhythm/pulse checks should not be performed or should be delayed by several minutes. 
Double sequential defibrillation
Consider for refractory arrhythmias.
In this technique, two defibrillators (four pads) are used almost simultaneously to theoretically lower the threshold for myocardial depolarization with the first shock and then successfully depolarize the sensitized myocardium with the second shock. The higher energy settings utilized in this case increase the risk of post-resuscitation myocardial stunning.
Extremely limited data are available. This technique has been analyzed in case studies and small case series, but the lack of more substantive evidence precludes a recommendation for widespread use. 
Vasopressors
The physiological rationale for using vasopressors during cardiac arrest is to increase systemic vascular resistance and thereby generate a pressure gradient that promotes perfusion of blood to the heart, brain, and vital organs.
Unless an easily correctable etiology of cardiac arrest is rapidly identified, most patients will require exogenous catecholamines to restore circulation or maintain a therapeutic window for correction of the underlying etiology.
Epinephrine
Exerts both alpha and beta adrenergic effects.
The use of epinephrine consistently improves return of spontaneous circulation rates, survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge. The impact of epinephrine on neurological outcome is less certain, with no clear statistical evidence of benefit or harm, but the magnitude of effect in either direction does not appear to be large.
Accumulated dosing may result in downstream deleterious effects such as beta adrenergic toxicity that increases myocardial oxygen consumption, ectopic ventricular arrhythmias, hypoxemia from pulmonary arteriovenous shunting, and poor post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction. Excessive alpha adrenergic activity may also impair microcirculation to the brain and other vital organs (ERC ALS Guidelines). 
Existing Evidence
Several large, population-based, propensity-matched observational studies of patients treated with and without epinephrine have consistently demonstrated an increased likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation but mixed findings regarding survival and favorable neurological outcomes at hospital discharge or at 1 month. 
Two randomized trials comparing epinephrine with placebo consistently demonstrated improved return of spontaneous circulation rates, survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge in patients receiving epinephrine, but the impact on neurological outcome was less certain. 
One large randomized trial comparing epinephrine with placebo did note additional survivors with worse neurological outcome at hospital discharge in the epinephrine group. Subjects in the epinephrine group had improved 3-mo survival without statistical difference in favorable or unfavorable neurological outcomes at 3 mo. The net increase in survivors constituted additional survivors with both favorable and unfavorable neurological outcomes. There was no clear statistical evidence of long-term benefit or harm, but the magnitude of the effect in either direction did not appear to be large (ILCOR CoSTR).  It is noteworthy that the neurologic status of initially comatose cardiac arrest survivors can improve for up to 6 months after the event. 
Subgroup analyses of both randomized trials suggest that the effects of epinephrine are more pronounced in patients with non-shockable rhythms than in those with shockable rhythms. Given the relative lack of competing beneficial interventions, it is reasonable to administer epinephrine as soon as feasible in cases of non-shockable rhythms. In cases of shockable rhythms, epinephrine can be deferred until after failed initial defibrillation attempts. (AHA ALS Guidelines)
The 2019 American Heart Association Focused Update strongly recommended administration of standard-dose epinephrine based on their interpretation of moderate-quality evidence from randomized data. The writing group prioritized the consistent improvements in return of spontaneous circulation, short-term survival, and long-term survival, while acknowledging the continuing uncertainty about overall impact on neurologic outcome. (AHA ALS Guidelines)
Recommended Dosing
Epinephrine dosing and timing remains an active area of investigation. 
Epinephrine is usually administered in 1-mg incremental doses, regardless of age, sex, or body mass. Historical trials testing high (15 mg) and moderate (7 mg) initial doses of epinephrine exhibited higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation but no improvement in overall survival.  In any other setting, vasopressors are titrated based on clinical indicators. Only during cardiac arrest is epinephrine typically administered in rote, repeated time-based intervals. Lower doses and titrated dosing by bolus or infusion are active areas of investigation.
Vasopressin
Has been de-emphasized in the treatment of cardiac arrest to reduce clinical complexity.
Can theoretically increase the coronary perfusion pressure via vasopressin receptors without potentially deleterious adrenergic effects. However, a recent systematic review found no definitive evidence of benefit or harm when comparing epinephrine plus vasopressin or vasopressin alone to epinephrine (ILCOR CoSTR).
Antidysrhythmics
The physiological rationale for administering antidysrhythmic drugs during cardiac arrest is extrapolated from cardiac electrophysiology.
Amiodarone increases the action potential duration and refractory period in both atrial and ventricular myocytes. It slows atrioventricular conduction and exerts a mild negative inotropy.
Lidocaine increases the myocyte refractory period, decreases ventricular automaticity, and suppresses ventricular ectopy via the local anesthetic action as a sodium channel inhibitor. It suppresses the activity of depolarized arrhythmogenic tissue by depressing action potential phase 0 but does not interfere with normal myocardium (ERC ALS Guidelines).
Given the potential to promote return of spontaneous circulation, the possibility of time-dependent effects, and the absence of evidence demonstrating overt harm, it is reasonable to administer amiodarone or lidocaine to patients after unsuccessful defibrillation attempts.
The primary evidence for antidysrhythmic drugs during cardiac arrest comes from 1 randomized trial comparing amiodarone to placebo,  1 randomized trial comparing amiodarone to lidocaine,  and a 3-arm randomized trial comparing amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo. 
Two earlier trials  used polysorbate 80 as a placebo or additive in lidocaine to simulate the viscosity of amiodarone and used prehospital providers who were blind to the treatment arm. Polysorbate 80 has displayed adverse hemodynamic effects in live animals, but the effects on humans in cardiac arrest are uncertain. Amiodarone compared with polysorbate 80 placebo resulted in more patients with return of spontaneous circulation, but no change in survival or neurological outcome was observed. Lidocaine compared with saline placebo resulted in more patients with return of spontaneous circulation, but no change in survival or neurological outcome was found.
A priori subgroup analyses of patients who experienced a witnessed cardiac arrest found an increased survival to discharge in patients receiving an active drug (amiodarone or lidocaine) compared with saline placebo. This finding may reflect a time-dependent effect of antidysrhythmics in cardiac arrest.
None of the trials showed evidence of more survivors with a poor neurological outcome.
Amiodarone
Amiodarone blocks the atrioventricular node when given via IV administration and should not generally be used in patients with known atrial fibrillation and an accessory pathway such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome if known prior to cardiac arrest.
Although amiodarone may cause ventricular arrhythmias, this condition is much more likely to occur with other factors that cause QT prolongation, such as severe hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia.
Although hypotension can occur in up to 26% of patients when given IV amiodarone, the incidence of torsade de pointes is <1%. 
Beta blockade
This is an area of active investigation. Case reports and case series have demonstrated the feasibility of a short-acting beta blocker such as esmolol to theoretically terminate the electrical storm responsible for refractory VF or to attenuate the deleterious effects of excessive beta activation from epinephrine on myocardial oxygen requirements, ischemic injury, and the VF threshold.  The lack of more substantive evidence precludes its recommendation for widespread use, but it is reasonable to attempt beta blockers combined with double sequential defibrillation in the setting of refractory ventricular dysrhythmias.
Metabolic Drugs
Empirical treatment of metabolic disturbances (eg, serum buffers, dextrose, calcium, magnesium) lacks supporting data for use in the non-differentiated arrest. Instead, these therapies should specifically target known or strongly suspected abnormalities as the etiology of cardiac arrest.
Special Designation
Documentation
Be meticulous and precise in documenting the preclinical features leading up to cardiac arrest, as well as the salient historical information noted above (witnessed, bystander CPR, no-flow interval, low-flow interval, number of defibrillation attempts, number of epinephrine doses). These data tend to be propagated in the medical record, and it is easy to introduce factual discrepancies into these historical elements.
Obtain timely reports of the initial rhythm from prehospital sources. Automated external defibrillator rhythm strips can be obtained for review, although proprietary technology may be required. Rhythm strips from prehospital provider defibrillators should be included in the patient’s documentation.
Expert Opinion
Debriefing can improve individual performance and help address systemic factors but requires significant administrative support and appropriate timing. 
Taking even a few minutes to debrief can be logistically very challenging in a busy ED.
Intubation attempts may result in delays in chest compression time. Assigning an available team member to count out loud the seconds of no-flow time during the attempt may help improve situational awareness for the intubator. Goal setting will depend on the clinical scenario because hypoxic arrest with obvious aspiration, compared with a cardiogenic arrest with VF, may necessitate prompt endotracheal intubation while the VF scenario should be managed with chest compressions and defibrillation.

Key Concepts
Audio review 2015 EM:RAP Audio
Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and affects native or prosthetic heart valves as well as in-dwelling cardiac devices.
IE is challenging to diagnose. Despite advancements in care, IE has a 6-mo mortality of ~25%. 
Consider the diagnosis of IE in patients who are febrile with an identified source of inflammation or those with known bacteremia combined with cardiac risk factors (including a history of IE, known cardiac prosthesis, or congenital heart disease) or non-cardiac risk factors (IV drug abuse, immunocompromised state, or recent invasive procedure).
Patients with IE can present with acute or subacute infection.
Fever is the most common presenting symptom (90% of patients), but patients with subacute infection may present with non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weight loss, anorexia, or myalgias.
Physical exam can reveal a murmur in up to 85% of patients. Other extracardiac exam findings such as Janeway lesions (painless erythematous macules on the hands and feet), Osler’s nodes (painful erythematous SC nodules on the tips of the fingers and toes), and Roth’s spots (retinal hemorrhages with a pale center) are specific but not sensitive and are only seen in <5% of cases.  Photo Photo Photo
Patients can manifest systemic complications secondary to septic embolization, such as stroke, acute heart failure from valvular regurgitation, or infection involving the spine, joints, or musculature. Septic pulmonary emboli can occur with right-sided valvular lesions.
Laboratory markers are neither specific nor sensitive in the diagnosis of IE.
Effective treatment of IE requires a multidisciplinary approach involving emergency medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiology, and critical care at various points in the patient’s hospital course.
Standard diagnostic criteria include 3 separate sets of positive blood cultures (20 mL each) and positive cardiac echocardiography findings.
Antimicrobial therapy should be administered early after blood cultures have been drawn to minimize the risk of systemic embolic complications.
Early hospital consultation with cardiothoracic surgery is recommended for patients with suspected cardiac complications, including acute heart failure and perivalvular abscess, who may require early valve surgery.
Key Diagnostic Elements
History
Fever is present in 90% of patients and represents one of the minor Duke criteria.
The majority of patients present with non-specific complaints including malaise, anorexia, weakness, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, dyspnea, and chest pain.
Patients with acute IE are typically much more ill than those with subacute IE and generally have a rapid clinical deterioration.
Physical Exam
Cardiac murmur is observed in 85% of patients.
Vascular and immunologic phenomena including Janeway lesions and Osler’s nodes are supportive of IE but are much less commonly seen in clinical practice.
If possible, obtain 3 sets of blood cultures (20 mL each) from 3 different sites (ie, 3 separate percutaneous or catheter contacts) prior to initiating IV antibiotics.
The diagnosis of IE is based on clinical findings, microbiological data from blood cultures, and echocardiogram imaging.
Echocardiogram is key to diagnosis and is one of the modified major Duke criteria. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is more sensitive than TTE, especially in cases of PVE. 
The modified Duke criteria utilize pathologic, historical, clinical, and microbiologic data elements to diagnose IE.

Microbiological evidence: Positive blood culture but does not meet one of the major criteria noted above (excluding single positive cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci and organisms that do not cause endocarditis) or serological evidence of active infection with an organism consistent with IE.
Treatment
In a clinically stable patient (ie, not systemically ill and without shock or respiratory compromise) with possible native valve disease, it is reasonable for the clinician to defer antibiotic administration while awaiting blood culture results.
Treatment of PVE focuses not only on antibiotic therapy but also surgical intervention during hospitalization. Management of PVE is usually more complicated and typically includes surgery to replace the infected valve in order to prevent septic complications.
Empiric antibiotic therapy varies depending on whether the involved valve is native or prosthetic. IV antibiotics should be bactericidal and tailored to the treatment of staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci in both NVE and PVE but should also cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in PVE. Antibiotics can be narrowed once the pathogen is identified via blood cultures.

Background
Epidemiology
Despite being a rare disease, IE has become more common, with an annual incidence of 15 cases per 100,000 people in the U.S. This increasing prevalence is largely due to a surge in healthcare-associated infections. 
Since the early 2000’s, the median patient age has shifted from the early- to mid-40’s to over 70 y. 
There are a number of predispospising cardiac and non-cardiac risk factors for IE. In low-income countries, rheumatic heart disease remains the biggest risk factor, whereas in higher-income countries, predisposing risk factors include congenital heart disease, IV drug usage, and the presence of an intracardiac device.
While healthcare-associated IE has become more prevalent, community-acquired IE still accounts for 70% of cases and is associated with oral, gastrointestinal (GI), and cutaneous bacterial infections (secondary to IV drug abuse). 
Advancements in surgical care accompanied by an increased frequency of surgical procedures have led to a surge in nosocomial cases of IE, accounting for approximately 20-30% of cases.  Despite these improvements in care, morbidity and mortality remain high.
Risk factors for IE in the pediatric population include congenital heart disease and in-dwelling vascular catheters. 
Staphylococcus has surpassed penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus as the most common pathogenic cause of IE, accounting for approximately one-third of cases.  In a large prospective cohort study of 1,779 patients with definite IE, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 31.6% of cases, while Streptococcus viridans accounted for 18%. Patients with Staphylococcus aureus IE were more likely to have a nosocomial source of infection along with higher rates of stroke, systemic embolization, persistent bacteremia, and death. 
In-hospital mortality for IE ranges from 15-22% in industrialized nations with a 5-y mortality of 40%.  The mortality largely depends on the virulence of the organism involved and complications related to septic emboli. Patients with Staphylococcus aureus IE have a much higher mortality.
Pathophysiology
The heart comprises 4 chambers and 4 valves: tricuspid, pulmonic, mitral, and aortic. Endocarditis can involve the endocardial surface, valvular structures, or a pre-existing intracardiac device such as a pacemaker or implanted cardioverter defibrillator.
An intact endocardial surface is resistant to bacteremia; therefore, endocarditis occurs in patients with a compromised endocardium. Endothelial injury initiates a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade, leading to the formation of a platelet-rich fibrin thrombus that serves as a nidus for bacterial adhesion and subsequent vegetation. 
This platelet-rich fibrin thrombus becomes secondarily infected by bacteria in the bloodstream that arise from a distant site. The sources of bacteremia can be obvious, as in cases of IV drug abuse, an infected vascular catheter, or an odontogenic infection. Less obvious causes can arise from antecedent skin, genitourinary, GI, or oral mucosal trauma. 
Rheumatic heart disease was previously considered the most common defect predisposing patients to endocarditis but only accounts for 10% of cases in industrialized countries. Currently, acquired cardiac valvular defects, such as mitral regurgitation from degenerative heart disease, are considered more common culprits.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
IE is a challenging diagnosis that is often missed on the first clinical encounter. In 1885, William Osler noted that “few diseases present greater difficulties in the way of diagnosis than malignant endocarditis, difficulties which in many cases are practically insurmountable.”  Despite significant advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, Osler’s statement is still significant, as the disease remains a diagnostic challenge for physicians.
Clinical manifestations vary widely. Patients with acute IE develop rapidly progressive disease in the form of rigors, sepsis, and systemic complications, while those with subacute IE present with more vague and chronic symptoms. Patients with staphylococcal IE present with a much more aggressive form of disease. Injection drug users typically present with rapid progression and are systemically ill, given the strong association with Staphylococcal aureus infection in right-sided cardiac structures. 
Fever is the most commonly reported symptom and is seen in 90% of patients. Other constitutional symptoms are non-specific and include myalgias, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, headache, dyspnea, and cough. These vague symptoms are more common in patients who present subacutely. 
Cardiac murmurs are the most common examination finding and are observed in 85% of patients.
Left-sided endocarditis is much more common than right-sided. Right-sided endocarditis typically involves the tricuspid valve and is usually seen in IV drug users and patients with intracardiac devices or central venous catheters.
Other supportive exam findings include splenomegaly, petechiae, and splinter hemorrhages. Photo Classic medical teaching emphasizes the presence of Osler’s nodes, Roth’s spots, and Janeway lesions. Photo Photo While highly specific for IE, these Oslerian exam manifestations of IE are rarely seen in clinical practice. Osler’s nodes are tender hemorrhagic nodules on the fingertips and pads of the toes. Roth’s spots are hemorrhagic lesions with a central pallor that can be seen in the retina. 
A normal physical exam should not be used to exclude the diagnosis of IE.
Complications of IE can involve any organ system or can be related to a systemic infection:
Cardiac: Valvular insufficiency, acute heart failure, shock, pulmonary edema.
Central nervous system (CNS): Embolic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, meningitis, brain abscess, intracerebral hemorrhage.
Pulmonary: Septic pulmonary emboli.
Vascular: Acute arterial occlusion.
Renal: Renal failure and glomerulonephritis.
Metastatic infections: Septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, psoas abscess.  CNS complications are the most common and are seen in 15-20% of patients.  Risk factors for embolic events include Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and large vegetations involving the mitral valve. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Echocardiographic findings are critical in the diagnosis of IE and represent a major Duke clinical criterion. Abnormal findings include a valvular vegetation, perivalvular abscess, or leaflet perforation. TTE has a sensitivity of 70% and 50% for diagnosing NVE and PVE, respectively.  Despite its low sensitivity, TTE has a high negative predictive value and therefore should be the initial imaging study of choice in patients with suspected IE. While TEE is more sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of a valvular vegetation, TTE is more easily accessible from the ED and does not require patients to be NPO.
TEE is preferred over TTE in patients with a known prosthetic valve, intracardiac implant, or intracardiac abscess. Patients with a high pretest probability for IE and a negative TTE should undergo TEE.
Cardiac CT angiography and nuclear cardiac imaging can be used in the inpatient environment.
Laboratory Evaluation
Early laboratory studies are generally non-specific in the diagnosis of IE and should not be used to rule out IE.
Positive blood cultures are important for IE diagnosis and are a major Duke criterion. Three sets of blood cultures (20 mL each) can detect ~97% of bacteremia cases and therefore should be obtained prior to the initiation of IV antibiotics. Ideally, cultures should be drawn from 3 separate venipuncture sites at least 30-60 min apart. 
An elevated white blood cell level is non-specific and is typically seen in 50% of cases. 
Elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) have been reported in up to 66% of cases. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment of IE requires a multidisciplinary approach and includes IV antibiotics as well as source control with early surgery in half of cases to remove and replace the infected valve or drain intracardiac abscesses.
In the ED, resuscitation of the compromised patient is the first priority of therapy.
Early antibiotic therapy in patients with suspected IE is the mainstay of treatment and depends on whether the involved valve is native or prosthetic.
The selection of empiric IV antibiotics depends on whether the infection involves a native or prosthetic valve. Despite appropriate treatment with early IV antibiotics, 50% of patients will still require surgery. 
Indications for surgery are based on observational studies rather than formal guidelines.
These indications include: 
Valvular dysfunction resulting in acute decompensated heart failure
Heart failure secondary to valve dehiscence, intracardiac fistula, or severe prosthetic valve dysfunction
Infection causing heart block, annular or aortic abscess, or a destructive penetrating lesion
Persistent bacteremia or fever >5-7 d after the initiation of IV antibiotics
Surgery should be considered in the following cases:
IE caused by a fungal infection or a resistant organism
Recurrent emboli or persistent/enlarging vegetations despite IV antibiotics
Severe valvular regurgitation and vegetations >10 mm in size
Vegetations >10 mm when associated with the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve
Relapsing PVE
The goal of surgery is to prevent systemic complications from embolic disease, treat valvular dysfunction leading to shock and heart failure, and manage uncontrolled infection. Early surgery (<48 h) in patients with native left-sided endocarditis and severe valvular disease has been shown to significantly reduce in-hospital death rates and systemic complications from septic emboli. 
Care of Patients after Successful Treatment
Society guidelines recommend that patients with IE undergo treatment with IV antibiotics for 6 wk.
A recent randomized, non-inferiority, multicenter trial found that clinically stable patients with left-sided IE treated with oral antibiotics compared to IV antibiotics had similar outcomes in mortality.  The results of this trial have not impacted current management guidelines but may impact future long-term management.
Prevention
Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE is recommended in patients undergoing an invasive procedure who have a prosthetic valve, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, or a history of IE. These recommendations were revised by the American Heart Association in 2007 and are based on a theoretical advantage rather than randomized clinical trials. 
Procedures considered to be invasive include dental procedures involving gingival manipulation (this includes routine dental cleaning), pulmonary biopsy or incision, GI or GU procedures in patients with an active GI or GU infection, procedures on infected skin or soft tissue, and placement of a prosthetic cardiac valve.

Key Concepts
HF is a broad term that encompasses the pathophysiological end result of a multitude of disease processes.
HF develops when any structural or functional cardiac disorder causes impaired ventricular filling or ejection of blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues while maintaining normal filling pressures.
Cardinal manifestations include dyspnea, fatigue, and retention of fluid.
The term “heart failure” is preferred over “congestive heart failure” (CHF) because patients may present with or without signs and symptoms of congestion (ie, without volume overload).
The clinical syndrome of HF may result from disorders of the pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, heart valves, or great vessels or from certain metabolic abnormalities, but the majority of patients have symptoms due to impaired left ventricular (LV) function.
HF is not synonymous with either cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction. These terms are simply examples of structural or functional impairments that lead to the development of HF.
HF may occur in the presence of normal cardiac function during periods of high metabolic demand or high-output HF.
HF is associated with a wide spectrum of LV functional abnormalities, ranging from normal LV size and preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and markedly reduced EF.
EF is important in the classification of patients with HF; most clinical trials select patients based on EF.
EF values are dependent on the operator, method of analysis, and imaging technique used. Some techniques may indicate abnormalities in systolic function among patients with a preserved EF; hence, the following terms are preferred instead of reduced or preserved “systolic function”:
HF with reduced EF (HFrEF): Impaired ejection, LVEF ≤40%
HF with preserved EF (HFpEF): Abnormal filling, LVEF ≥50%
Abnormalities of systolic and diastolic function can coexist, irrespective of EF.
HF is a clinical diagnosis based on a careful history and physical exam; there is no single diagnostic test.
Acute HF syndromes vary in severity from mildly decompensated HF to a rapid progression of pulmonary edema with severe hypertension (SCAPE) to hypotension with multi-organ system failure from cardiogenic shock.
Treatment of acute HF syndromes will depend on the underlying etiology and triggers (eg, acute decompensated HF, SCAPE, or cardiogenic shock).
Not every patient with pulmonary edema is total body volume-overloaded. Some of these patients may instead present as euvolemic or hypovolemic and need IV fluids. Therefore, the decision to use diuretics vs. IV fluids should be based on an assessment of their volume status using history and physical exam.
Most patients with a history of chronic HF know their “dry weight.” A significant increase in the current weight over the dry weight is suggestive of fluid overload, and these patients are likely to benefit from diuresis.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Ultimately, HF is a clinical diagnosis, based on a careful history and physical examination. There is no single diagnostic test for HF, yet laboratory studies and imaging can help support the diagnosis. Assess the patient’s current weight vs. dry weight to gauge whether the patient is fluid-overloaded and will benefit from diuresis.
Although an underlying cause cannot always be identified, common triggers include infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), arrhythmia, poor blood pressure (BP) control, substance abuse, and dietary or medication non-compliance.
Common signs may include tachycardia, increased work of breathing, rales, jugular venous distention, and peripheral edema (may not be present in SCAPE, some patients can be euvolemic or hypovolemic).
Bedside U/S may show pulmonary B lines and a plump or distended inferior vena cava (IVC) suggestive of congestion. Assess for the presence or absence of pericardial or pleural effusions and obtain a global assessment of pump function and IVC caliber.
B-type (or brain) natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated (although the absolute value is not usually helpful).
Chest X-ray (CXR) often shows signs of pulmonary edema (although rapidly evolving forms may not show on CXR in the ED). Image
Troponin, creatinine, and LFTs may be elevated secondary to poor perfusion in severe cases.
Serial ECG and troponins can help assess for concurrent ACS.
Treatment
Acute Decompensated HF Exacerbation
Afterload reduction with nitrates and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients with normal or elevated BP.
Diuretics when the history and physical exam suggest volume overload.
Furosemide 20-40 mg IV, torsemide 10-20 mg IV, or bumetanide 1-2 mg IV if naive or usual dose unknown. Can give repeat doses as needed.
Debate exists on the best dosing strategies, but a minimum of the last PO dose is generally used as a 1:1 IV dose for twice the effect. Patients with chronic kidney disease will require higher dosing. 
Debate also exists regarding the choice of loop diuretic. Furosemide is the most commonly used option, but if the patient is on another loop diuretic, it can be used instead in the ED. A comparison of the basic pharmacokinetics of loop diuretics is given in Table.
Titration of home medications, usually diuretics, if being discharged.
Guideline-directed management therapy is determined by staging and classification and is more likely determined by the primary cardiologist than in the ED. However, discussion with the cardiologist can be helpful at the time of discharge from the ED. Pharmacotherapy may include aldosterone antagonists, hydralazine, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers. 
Sympathetic Crashing Acute Pulmonary Edema (SCAPE)
Administer nitrates and positive pressure ventilation to manage preload, afterload, and pulmonary edema. Early aggressive intervention can stave off intubation and reduce morbidity and mortality.
Appropriately dosed nitroglycerin is key to reducing preload and afterload.
NIPPV manages the work of breathing and provides ventilatory support.
Cardiogenic Shock
Ventilatory support, as in SCAPE.
Consider challenges with small 250-cc (250-mL) isotonic crystalloid boluses if patient is clinically hypovolemic.
Consider pressors (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or dobutamine) to bridge to more definitive therapy.
Consider early consultation with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery per institutional protocols for mechanical support measures such as IABP, Impella heart pumps, or ECMO.

Infusion: Start at 100 μg/min; can titrate up as tolerated or down if needed due to BP.
Hypotension is usually transient. Stop or decrease the dose of nitroglycerin if the patient’s BP drops. Generally a target range of systolic BP (SBP) ≥90 mm Hg is used.
Titrate with the physician at the bedside, monitoring the patient’s improvement and BP.
Also available as 0.4-mg SL tablets or spray and topical nitropaste 2% given as an initial dose of 0.5-1 inch to the chest wall in acute HF, but the bioavailability of nitropaste is variable and has doubtful utility in patients with acute HF.
ACE inhibitors for afterload reduction. 
Captopril 12.5-25 mg SL or PO
Enalaprilat 1.25 mg IV
Diuretics
Acute pulmonary edema is frequently not fluid-overloaded but fluid-redistributed. 
Diuretics may not be effective due to poor renal perfusion in acute HF exacerbations.
In patients who are volume-overloaded, consider diuretics after the acute phase has passed with furosemide, torsemide, or bumetanide.
Adrenergic agonists
In cardiogenic shock, the goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is >65 mm Hg to maintain adequate coronary perfusion.
Norepinephrine: 0.05-1 μg/kg/min, titrate by 0.02 μg/kg/min q5 min.
Epinephrine: 0.05-1 μg/kg/min, titrate by 0.02 μg/kg/min q5 min.
Dobutamine: 2.5 μg/kg/min, titrate by 2.5 μg/kg/min q10min (max: 20 μg/kg/min).
Advanced mechanical therapies: IABP, LVAD, Impella, or ECMO.

Appropriate follow-up
Charting Pearls
Onset of symptoms, possible causes, and exacerbating historical features are important to note in the history of the present illness.
Document the presence or absence of new murmurs that may indicate the need for a STAT echo.
Carefully document the volume status and respiratory status at presentation. These parameters will change with aggressive treatment, and it is important for the inpatient team to know which phenotype and symptoms were treated.
Document a presenting weight if possible. This condition is a time-dependent, dynamic disease across the spectrum of HR; thus, presentation and ED course and interventions are key.
Note response to treatment, change in volume status, and effects on repeat U/S exams.
Urine output is very important in these patients.
If ACS or other condition that may affect rhythm is suspected, telemetry is important, in addition to serial ECGs. Make sure that any rhythm changes on the monitor or in serial ECGs are noted with time stamps for the inpatient team.",Heart Failure

Background
Epidemiology
A total of 6.5 million Americans have HF per American Heart Association (AHA) estimates, with an estimated 23 million HF patients worldwide. 
The lifetime risk of HF between ages 45 and 95 y is high (20%-45%). 
Less than 50% of patients with LV dysfunction on echo are symptomatic; thus, undiagnosed HF is common. 
Prevalence increases with age: 8/1,000 men age 50-59 y have symptomatic HF, compared with 66/1,000 at age 80-89 y. 
Prevalence in women is approximately 60% that of men in each age group. 
African Americans have the highest risk of developing HF, followed by Hispanic, white, and Chinese Americans (4.6, 3.5, 2.4, and 1.0 per 1,000 person-years, respectively), reflecting underlying differences in the prevalence of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and socioeconomic status. 
The lifetime risk of developing HF for Americans ≥40 y of age is 20%. 
Projections show that the prevalence of HF will increase by 46% from 2012 to 2030 due to increasing survival.
Among hospital admissions in patients >65 y, 20% are due to HF. 
One in 8 deaths has HF mentioned on the death certificate.
Mortality following hospitalization is 10.4% at 30 d, 22% at 1 y, and 42.3% at 5 y.
The total cost of diagnosing and treating HF exceeds $30 billion annually. 
Terminology of HF
HF is a broad term that encompasses the pathophysiological end result of a multitude of disease processes. HF develops when any structural or functional cardiac disorder causes impaired ventricular filling or ejection of blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues while maintaining normal filling pressures.
HF is not synonymous with either cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction. These terms are simply examples of structural or functional impairments that lead to the development of HF.
HF is associated with a wide spectrum of LV functional abnormalities, ranging from normal LV size and preserved EF to severe dilatation and markedly reduced EF.
Abnormalities of systolic and diastolic function can coexist, irrespective of EF.
There are many ways to classify HF, but it is commonly described using the following descriptors.
Acute vs. chronic
Acute HF occurs when an acute event causes the heart to suddenly become unable to generate an adequate stroke volume.
Caused by, for example, an acute MI, acute valve rupture, dysrhythmia, myocarditis, tamponade, or infection.
May present as sudden “flash” pulmonary edema and/or shock.
Heart size may be normal as it has not had time to change in size.
Chronic HF is much more common and develops over time, often months to years.
Usually caused by ischemia, chronic HTN, or chronic valvular disease.
In ischemic heart disease, chronic valvular disease, and chronic uncontrolled HTN, the heart’s growth and remodelling process is an attempt to compensate for its decreasing function.
An acute exacerbation of chronic HF can be triggered by infection, anemia, dietary or medication non-compliance, or coronary artery disease (CAD).
Left- vs. right-sided
Left-sided failure refers to failure of the LV to pump blood forward (causing hypotension and hypoperfusion) and the resulting backup of blood into the lungs (pulmonary edema).
Right-sided failure refers to failure of the right ventricle (RV) to pump blood forward and results in a failure of the RV to “feed” the LV its preload and a backup of blood (causing jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema).
The most common cause of right-sided failure is left-sided failure, and patients often present with manifestations of both.
Isolated right-sided failure can occur acutely (eg, in pulmonary embolism, hypoxia, or acidemia) or chronically (eg, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]).
HFrEF vs. HFpEF 
The EF is important in the classification of patients with HF, and most clinical trials select patients based on EF.
EF values are dependent on the operator, method of analysis, and imaging technique used. Some techniques may indicate abnormalities in systolic function among patients with a preserved EF; hence, it is preferred to categorize patients using LVEF thresholds instead of reduced or preserved “systolic function.”
Patients with chronic HF can be divided into 2 broad categories:
HFrEF: Impaired ejection; LVEF ≤40%.
HFpEF: Abnormal filling; LVEF ≥50%.
Although it is conceptually convenient to consider systolic and diastolic dysfunction as separate processes, in reality, the two almost always coexist.
HFrEF and HFpEF are distinct syndromes.
HFrEF is characterized by abnormalities in systolic function, usually with progressive chamber dilation and eccentric remodeling.
HFpEF is characterized by a normal LVEF, normal LV end-diastolic volume, and abnormal diastolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF are not synonymous. Diastolic dysfunction is a functional abnormality that may be present regardless of LVEF.
Diastolic dysfunction alone is part of normal human aging, and although it is a risk factor for developing HFpEF, it is also seen in patients who never develop HFpEF.
Studies have described a third group of patients with intermediate LVEF (LVEF: 41%-49%) who exhibit features of both HFrEF and HFpEF. Some experts treat these patients as HFrEF, whereas others treat such patients as borderline HFpEF.
Conversion from HFpEF to HFrEF is uncommon and is typically associated with an incident injury (ie, MI).
Pathophysiology of Common Clinical HF Presentations
Acute Decompensated HF
Hemodynamic abnormalities and circulatory failure from HF result in neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance with an increase in sympathetic activity and withdrawal of vagal activity. 
A network of compensatory mechanisms exists to counteract circulatory failure from HF (eg, increase blood volume and filling pressures, increase heart rate and muscle mass).
Chronic wall stress causes myocyte hypertrophy, death, and regeneration. This leads to eccentric remodeling that progressively impairs contractility, increases O2 demand/ischemia, and promotes arrhythmogenesis.
Altered relaxation and increased stiffness of the ventricle (delayed Ca2+ uptake and efflux from myocytes) occur in response to an increased afterload (pressure overload).
Impaired relaxation leads to impaired diastolic filling of the LV.
These processes occur slowly over time; when a trigger (eg, illness, dietary changes, medication non-compliance) temporarily worsens the cardiac output or increases the body’s demand, it overwhelms the compensatory mechanisms and the patient becomes symptomatic.
SCAPE
Severe subset of acute HF presentations characterized by rapidly progressing pulmonary edema (minutes to hours) and sympathetic overdrive.
Decreased systemic perfusion and worsening oxygenation cause a sympathetic surge.
This condition further increases the afterload, resulting in worsening pulmonary edema, further sympathetic activity, and a rapidly decompensating patient.
These patients are often overall fluid-depleted, even though they have significant pulmonary edema.
SCAPE patients may not have signs or symptoms associated with chronic HF, such as cardiomegaly or lower extremity edema, because the condition develops over a very short period.
Cardiogenic Shock
Patients with worsening cardiac function may progress to shock during an HF exacerbation.
This is a problem of poor forward flow and presents with hypotension (SBP <90 mm Hg).
Shock can be associated with either acute exacerbations of chronic HF or with SCAPE-like HF presentations.
Caused when systolic or diastolic dysfunction becomes sufficiently severe that SBP can no longer be maintained by normal physiologic processes.
These patients are often intravascularly hypovolemic, but can be hypotensive in the presence of interstitial hypervolemia if pump dysfunction is severe.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
All types of acute HF presentations are clinical diagnoses, although labs and imaging can assist in confirming the diagnosis or ruling out other diagnoses.
The overall clinical gestalt of the initial treating ED physician is associated with a high positive likelihood ratio (LR+) (4.4; 95% CI, 1.8-10) for the diagnosis of HF.
When the ED physician assesses the dyspneic patient as unlikely to have HF, the odds decrease by about half (LR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.28-0.73). 
Acute decompensated HF is the most common presentation of HF in the ED.
History
Dyspnea associated with lower extremity edema.
Symptoms often consist of exercise intolerance, generalized fatigue, orthopnea, chest discomfort, and clothes/shoes fitting tighter.
Symptoms gradually worsen over days to weeks.
Patients may have a known diagnosis of HF; however, misdiagnosed HF and undiagnosed or minimally symptomatic HF are common.
Patients may have one or more of several common risk factors: CAD, HTN, diabetes, obesity, smoking, high-sodium diet, valvular heart disease.
Physical Exam
Cardiac: Tachycardia or an S3 heart sound (highly specific).
Pulmonary: Tachypnea, increased work of breathing, dyspnea while talking, crackles, wheezing, or diminished air entry at the bases.
Abdominal: Right upper quadrant tenderness to palpation from hepatic congestion.
Extremity exam may show jugular venous distention and lower extremity edema (should be bilateral and symmetric), which may rise to the abdomen and cause scrotal edema or ascites. EM:RAP Video
Bedside U/S may show B lines on lung exam, a grossly enlarged heart, and a dilated IVC.
SCAPE
While less common, requires early identification and emergency treatment to avoid intubation, ICU admission, and morbidity.
History
Typically presents as undifferentiated severe dyspnea developing over minutes to hours.
The patient may or may not have a previous diagnosis of HF.
Other classic symptoms of HF may not be present (eg, lower extremity edema, worsening exercise intolerance, weight gain).
Physical Exam
Cardiac exam will show tachycardia.
Lung exam will be notable for tachypnea, significant dyspnea, and rales in all lung fields.
Abdominal and extremity exam may not show any of the typical signs of HF such as hepatic congestion, jugular venous distention, or lower extremity edema.
Bedside U/S will show B lines on exam; however, cardiac evaluation often reveals no abnormalities, and IVC may actually show fluid depletion.
Cardiogenic Shock
History
Patients can present in cardiogenic shock associated with either acute decompensated HF or SCAPE.
Patients may additionally complain of lightheadedness, weakness, confusion, reduced urination, or other symptoms of end organ dysfunction.
Physical Exam
These patients will be hypotensive. They will likely also be tachycardic, but this may depend on the underlying pathology.
Extremities will likely be cold, as peripheral vasoconstriction may compensate for poor pump function.
Identifying triggers: While managing the symptoms of HF, it is important to attempt to identify the triggers and relevant comorbidities as well. Identification of any of the following key triggers will result in unique interventions:
ST-elevation MI: Identified on ECG.
Emergency cardiac catheterization.
Acute valvular rupture: Identified on stethoscope exam (new significant murmur) or echocardiography.
Emergency surgical intervention.
Pericardial tamponade: Identified on bedside U/S.
Emergency pericardiocentesis.
Alcohol withdrawal: Identified on history and physical exam.
Benzodiazepines, supportive therapy, and active airway management.
Arrhythmia: Identified on ECG.
Rate and possibly rhythm control.
Missed dialysis: Identified on history.
Similar initial treatment but will often need dialysis before symptoms will resolve (especially if anuric).
Physiologic stress (eg, from sepsis or diabetic ketoacidosis): Identified on history and labs.
Treat comorbid condition.
Thyrotoxicosis: Identified on history and physical exam.
One of the few cases in which a beta blocker may be appropriate in the acute phase of HF.
If given, a short-acting titratable beta blocker such as esmolol may be the safest choice.
Medical or dietary non-adherence: Identified on history.
One of the most common triggers, but its presence should not stop the search for other triggers.
Differential diagnoses: HF may mimic or coexist with any of the following, and these conditions should be considered in the work-up.
COPD
Pulmonary embolism
Pericardial effusion
Arrhythmia
Valvular disease
Hyper/hypothyroidism
Sepsis
Severe anemia
Radiographic Evaluation
CXR: May show an enlarged cardiac silhouette in patients with chronic HF. In acute exacerbations, CXR may show cephalization (dilation of the pulmonary veins), Image edema at the lung bases, or even effusions.
Notably, classic CXR findings for HF have a high specificity (71%-99%) but poor sensitivity (10%-64%); thus, while their presence helps confirm the diagnosis, their absence does not rule out HF. 
ECG: Reasonable in patients with symptoms suggestive of HF.
ECG evidence of left atrial enlargement and LV hypertrophy is sensitive (non-specific) for chronic LV dysfunction.
May suggest an acute brady- or tachydysrhythmia as the cause of HF or aid in the diagnosis of acute MI or likelihood of a prior MI.
The presence of a left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a marker for diminished LV systolic function.
Bedside U/S (echocardiography): May show a grossly enlarged heart, B lines throughout, and a plethoric IVC. EM:RAP Video
Laboratory Evaluation and Other Studies
Key Tests
CMP: Poor perfusion can lead to electrolyte abnormalities and acute renal or hepatic insufficiency.
CBC: Useful to rule out anemia and to look for signs of infection.
Troponin: High values can lead to the diagnosis of an MI as a triggering event; note that more sensitive troponin assays will frequently be positive at the baseline in many patients with chronic HF.
BNP: Must be interpreted with caution in acute HF presentations.
BNP <100 pg/mL or N-terminal (NT)-proBNP <300 pg/mL indicates that acute HF is unlikely (the proBNP cut-off is higher because the half life is greater), LR- = 0.1. 
BNP >1,000 pg/mL or NT-proBNP >30,000 pg/mL indicates that acute HF syndrome is likely. LR+ = 6 and 3.3, respectively.
Patients with chronic HF frequently have chronically elevated BNP levels, making the interpretation challenging.
BNP can also be elevated in COPD or pulmonary embolism due to effects on the RV.
Therapeutic Considerations
Concepts
Treatment of the spectrum of CHF exacerbations in the ED will depend on the pathophysiology of SCAPE vs. cardiogenic shock vs. acute decompensated HF.
Treatment goals will also vary based on a patient’s BP. In hypertensive patients, afterload and preload reduction are the primary goals. In hypotensive (shock) patients, target cardiac output with small fluid bolus challenges and inotropes while trying to differentiate an intervenable cause of shock such as valvulopathy or ischemia.
For SCAPE patients, important interventions are ventilatory support with NIPPV and preload/afterload reduction with nitrates.
Diuretics may play a role but usually not in resuscitation. Patients are frequently not hypervolemic but need their fluid shifted out of the interstitial space.
Acute Decompensated HF
Hypertensive acute decompensated HF treatment should be targeted to afterload and preload reduction.
Afterload can be reduced with a number of medicines, including nitrates and ACE inhibitors:
Nitrates are first line, with nitroglycerin being the most common. At moderate doses, nitroglycerin mostly affects the preload, but at high IV infusion doses (anywhere between 100 and 250 μg/min), arteriolar dilation occurs, which helps with afterload reduction. 
Caution is warranted for the use of nitrates with low SBP, bradycardia, and recent use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil).
Nitroprusside is an alternative to nitroglycerin, especially for patients who are extremely hypertensive and symptomatic because of its effect in reducing both preload and afterload, as well as its effectiveness in refractory HTN.
However, studies on nitroprusside in acute hypertensive HF are more limited than those with nitroglycerin. Nitroprusside can also cause hypotension and reflex tachycardia as well as “coronary steal syndrome,” which shunts blood from the heart to the periphery.
Start at 0.1-0.125 μg/kg/min, titrate by 0.1 μg/kg/min q5min (max: 400 μg/min).
ACE inhibitors are antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and are also afterload reducers. Patients are frequently already on an ACE inhibitor because of its mortality benefit in chronic HF, and there is some evidence that a single SL dose of captopril (12.5-25 mg) or a single IV dose of enalapril (1.25 mg) has some efficacy in acute HF. 
However, there is potential for hypotension because these agents are not titratable. Additionally, repeated dosing can cause renal dysfunction; therefore, if these agents are used, a single dose only in the ED is recommended.
Nesiritide is a natriuretic peptide approved for use in acute HF. However, its benefit in acute HF is controversial. The ASCEND-HF trial (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure) showed a statistical improvement in dyspnea but also more hypotension. There was also a question of increased mortality and renal toxicity. As a result, nesiritide has been widely studied but is not currently routinely recommended for use in acute HF. 
Short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as nicardipine have been studied in acute hypertensive HF with some promising safety data. However, rapid-onset dihydropyridine CCBs such as nifedipine should be avoided because of unpredictable effects on peripheral resistance and an increased risk of decreasing coronary and cerebral perfusion.
Diuretics can be used in intravascularly volume-overloaded patients and are a mainstay of therapy and preload reduction. Loop diuretics are the most frequently used, with primary drugs being furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide.
Furosemide is the most frequently used diuretic, and the traditional dosing approach is to use the same dose of home oral furosemide (in milligrams) for an IV dose in the ED (eg, a patient on 40 mg PO at home can be given 40 mg IV for an acute exacerbation in the ED). The PO to IV dose effect is 2✕ for IV administration. 
The optimal dosing of diuretics is controversial; topics of debate include continuous IV infusions vs. intermittent bolus dosing and high dose vs. low dose.
The superiority of continuous IV infusion vs. intermittent IV bolus has been debated, but most studies conclude that there is no significant benefit in mortality although 24-h urine output and body weight reductions may be higher with continuous IV infusion. 
The DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) study found no significant differences in patients’ assessment of symptoms or renal function between intermittent bolus and continuous infusion or between high dose (2.5✕ previous oral dose as IV) and low dose (same dose as patient’s previous oral dose). 
Check and replenish electrolytes, particularly magnesium and potassium, as these patients may have abnormalities and are also already frequently at high risk for arrhythmias.
Take a careful history to address exacerbating features. If non-compliance is the cause, counseling the patient on the importance of home medicines can help prevent future ED visits. History can also indicate ischemic causes of HF or valvulopathies that would result in different management.
Assess the patient’s improvement for disposition. Usually patients should have a positive urine output while in the ED, be able to ambulate without hypoxia or significant functional decline, and have a plan for follow-up.
Admission is appropriate for new-onset HF, especially if follow-up or cardiology referral will prove difficult. Patients will generally need an echo, assessment of response to medications, and optimization of medical treatment.
Patients with existing cardiologists could benefit from the ED coordinating a clinic follow-up or discussing medication titrations for home with the primary cardiologist.
Consider admission for existing HF patients in cases of hypotension, new acute kidney injury, no clear precipitant for HF, or minimal response to initial diuresis in the ED.
SCAPE
NIPPV (BiPAP and CPAP) should be started immediately to decrease the work of breathing, open the alveoli, and improve oxygenation.
The debate of CPAP vs. BiPAP is fairly equivocal. We recommend starting CPAP at 10 cm H2O or BiPAP at 10/5 cm H2O and adjusting up as the patient tolerates and with clinical response.
Afterload reduction is key in acute pulmonary edema with either high-dose nitroglycerin or ACE inhibitors.
Nitroglycerin should be started at high doses, although exact protocols may vary. Our recommended dosing for nitroglycerin is IV drip at 400 μg/min for 2 min as a bolus, followed by 100 μg/min drip that can be titrated up as tolerated by BP. Some literature supports even higher doses of nitroglycerin for severe decompensated HF or repeated high-dose boluses of nitroglycerin.  Nitroglycerin at these high doses should be titrated with the physician at the bedside.  In cases of hypotension, stop or decrease the dose because hypotension is usually transient.
Cycle the BP every 2-5 min until the hypertensive sympathetic surge is broken.
SL nitroglycerin tablets or spray 0.4 mg (400 μg) are an option if no IV is available, but SL nitroglycerin takes minutes to peak and has a bioavailability of around 30%-60%. 
Diuretics can have a role but usually not until the patient is stabilized, after the first hour of treatment. In the acute phase, diuretics can cause a further decline. Reserve for volume-overloaded patients vs. patients who need fluid shifted from extravascular space but are either hypovolemic or euvolemic.
The use of diuretics can be deleterious in acute decompensated HF, however, so use with caution. Studies have shown an association between loop diuretics in CHF patients and significant electrolyte imbalances, worsening renal function, and mortality. Diuretics can also activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system, worsening the afterload. 
Most patients will require admission to telemetry or higher depending on the degree of ventilatory support and drips still needed. Most patients will benefit from further medical optimization.
Cardiogenic Shock
Address the underlying cause of shock. This condition may be due to impaired forward flow from cardiogenic pump failure. However, consider acute ischemia or valvulopathy, which would require the cath lab or operating room, respectively, and call those consultants ASAP while focusing resuscitation on maintaining the BP.
If shock is from pump failure, these patients present a complex challenge because they are frequently extravascularly fluid-overloaded but potentially intravascularly volume-depleted or may only have a vasodilatory shock response.
For the underlying physiology, treatment will be similar to that of SCAPE, with NIPPV and afterload reduction (if BP tolerates).
Fluid challenges in 250-cc (250-mL) isotonic crystalloid boluses in addition to IVC U/S can be helpful to assess volume status and improve forward flow.
If there is no improvement with fluids, start an adrenergic agonist and/or phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor (eg, milrinone). There is no exact science on the preferred agent, with much debate as to which agent is best and why.
Norepinephrine (0.05-1 μg/kg/min, titrate by 0.02 μg/kg/min q5min) provides vasoconstriction.
Epinephrine (0.05-1 μg/kg/min, titrate by 0.02 μg/kg/min q5min) provides inotropy and vasoconstriction.
Dobutamine (2.5 μg/kg/min, titrate by 2.5 μg/kg/min q10min) is a good option for inotropy when the primary mechanism of shock is poor cardiac contractility. Patients may still need a second agent such as norepinephrine or epinephrine.
Milrinone (load with 50 μg/kg IV infusion over 10 min, then 0.125-0.75 μg/kg/min IV) will cause contractility but may not be the best choice in this case. It can cause vasodilation, has arrhythmogenic properties, and has a very slow onset, so it may be more appropriate for the ICU.
Advanced measures may be considered, such as IABP, Impella, LVAD, or even ECMO. These options will vary based on the stability of the patient and cardiology/cardiothoracic resources.

Stage B Treatment
For patients with a remote history of MI or ACS and HFrEF. Note that the maximum doses in parentheses are “target doses” usually titrated over days to weeks, dependent on the individual agent. ACE inhibitors may prevent symptoms and reduce mortality (also used in all patients with HFrEF to prevent symptomatic HF and to reduce morbidity and mortality).
Captopril 6.25 mg PO q8h (50 mg q8h max).
Enalapril 2.5 mg PO q12h (20 mg q12h max).
Lisinopril 2.5-5 mg PO q24h (40 mg q24h max).
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs): Use in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors.
Candesartan 4-8 mg PO q24h (32 mg q24h max).
Losartan 12.5-25 mg PO q24h (150 mg q24h max).
Valsartan 20-40 mg PO q12h (160 mg q12h max).
Beta blockers: Reduce mortality (also used in all patients with HFrEF to prevent symptomatic HF and to reduce morbidity and mortality).
Bisoprolol 1.25 mg PO q24h (10 mg q24h max).
Carvedilol immediate-release 3.125 mg PO q12h (25 mg q12h max if <85 kg and 50 mg max q12h if >85 kg).
Metoprolol ER 12.5-25 mg PO q24h (200 mg q24h max).
Avoid non-dihydropyridine CCBs (eg, verapamil, diltiazem), which may be harmful in patients with low LVEF.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.
Reasonable for patients with asymptomatic ischemic cardiomyopathy who are at least 40 d post-MI, have an LVEF <30%, are on appropriate medical therapy, and have a reasonable expectation of survival with good functional status for more than 1 y.
Stage C Treatment
Should receive specific education to facilitate self-care.
Regular physical activity is recommended for those who can participate.
Recommendations for Stage A and Stage B are recommended where appropriate for Stage C, plus the following:
Loop diuretics: For those with HFrEF and evidence of fluid retention, to improve symptoms:
Furosemide 20-40 mg PO q12-24h.
Bumetanide 0.5-1 mg PO q12-24h.
Torsemide 10-20 mg PO q24h.
Consider thiazides in patients with HTN:
Hydrochlorothiazide 25-100 mg PO q24h.
Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors or ARBs or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in conjunction with beta blockers and/or aldosterone antagonists is recommended in these patients for morbidity and mortality benefits.
ARBs: Use for patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors.
Aldosterone receptor antagonists: NYHA class II-IV with LVEF ≤35%, to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Also post-MI with LVEF ≤40% and with HF symptoms or DM.
Provided glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min and K <5.0 mEq/dL.
Inappropriate use can lead to life-threatening hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency.
ARNIs are a combination of an ARB and an inhibitor of neprilysin.
Initial studies on valsartan/sacubitril showed improvements in cardiovascular death and HF hospitalizations.
In patients already on an ACE inhibitor or ARB with chronic symptomatic HFrEF, replacement to an ARNI is recommended to further reduce morbidity and mortality.
ARNIs should not be given within 36 h of an ACE inhibitor or to those with a history of angioedema with an ACE inhibitor.
Ivabradine.
Can be beneficial to reduce HF admissions in symptomatic stable chronic HFrEF (5 mg PO q12h, 2.5 mg PO q12h in cases of conduction defects or bradycardia).
Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.
Recommended for African Americans with NYHA class III-IV HFrEF.
May also be useful for HFrEF patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
Hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate (fixed dose combo): 37.5 mg or 20 mg PO TID qD (75 mg/40 mg TID max).
Digoxin: May be beneficial in HFrEF, may decrease hospitalizations.
Benefits regardless of underlying rhythm (sinus or atrial fibrillation [AFib]).
Administer 0.125-0.25 mg PO q24h; dosage adjustments needed in cases of renal insufficiency.
Adverse events: Arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological complaints, and classic yellow-green halo vision changes have been described but are rare. Therapeutic concentrations for HF are generally 0.6-1.2 ng/mL, and toxicity may be seen with serum levels >2 ng/mL, often due to drug-drug interactions or changes in renal function. Note that hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia can precipitate toxicity at lower digoxin levels.
Anticoagulation: Patients with chronic HF, AFib, and an additional risk factor for cardioembolic stroke (HTN, DM, previous cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or ≥75 y of age) should receive anticoagulation.
Type of anticoagulant (warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, or rivaroxaban) should be individualized on a case-to-case basis.
Statins
Not beneficial as adjunctive therapy when prescribed solely for HF in the absence of other indications.
Omega-3 fatty acids.

"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Hypertensive emergency (severe hypertension with acute end-organ damage)
In patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (BP) and symptoms suggestive of end-organ damage (neurologic changes, blurred vision, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, back pain, decreased urine output), perform a targeted physical examination to assess for evidence of acute end-organ damage.
Funduscopic exam to evaluate for evidence of hypertensive retinopathy or papilledema.
Lung auscultation to evaluate for pulmonary edema.
Neurologic examination to evaluate for evidence of stroke.
Order appropriate labs and imaging studies to rapidly evaluate for evidence of acute end-organ damage.
Obtain CBC and chemistries.
Obtain chest X-ray to evaluate for pulmonary edema in patients presenting with dyspnea.
Obtain head CT in patients with neurologic abnormalities.
Obtain ECG and cardiac biomarkers in patients with anginal symptoms.
Obtain UA, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine in patients with decreased urine output.
If acute end-organ damage is identified in patients with severe BP elevation (≥180/120 mm Hg), initiate treatment:
With IV afterload-reducing medications to obtain a partial (~25%) reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) over the first hour.
Use rapidly titratable IV medications. Table
Invasive BP monitoring with an arterial line (when possible) is ideal for providing a more accurate and timely titration of the antihypertensive.
Key Concepts
Patients in the ED will commonly have elevated BP measurements.
The significance of elevated systemic pressure depends on the clinical context of the presentation.
Many patients experience elevated BP as a result of an underlying injury or disease process; others will present to the ED by referral or personal concern about an elevated BP measurement.
Patients presenting with markedly elevated BP (often ≥160-180/100-120 mm Hg) should be differentiated into those with or without signs and symptoms of acute end-organ dysfunction due to elevated BP.
Patients with signs and symptoms of acute end-organ dysfunction are defined as having a hypertensive emergency. They should be treated acutely (see below).
Asymptomatic patients (ie, those without signs or symptoms of acute end-organ dysfunction) do not require routine ED medical workups or treatment. Unnecessary aggressive treatment of these patients is associated with a greater risk of acute harm than benefit. 
Patients without evidence of acute end-organ dysfunction should be referred for outpatient follow-up and therapy.
Historically, markedly elevated BP without evidence of acute end-organ dysfunction was variably defined (eg, as hypertensive urgency, hypertensive crisis).
These terms have fallen out of favor, as the current literature more clearly differentiates hypertensive emergencies requiring immediate treatment from “asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure” and “asymptomatic hypertension,” which do not benefit from a rapid reduction in BP.
Hypertensive emergencies are defined by severe elevations in BP (≥180/120 mm Hg) complicated by acute end-organ dysfunction.
The degree of BP elevation does not correlate with the severity of organ damage; however, the rate of BP change strongly correlates with the likelihood of end-organ dysfunction. Following this relationship, individuals with longstanding hypertension develop vascular changes that protect target organs, whereas normotensive patients may develop hypertensive emergencies at markedly lower BPs.
Hypertensive emergencies may occur in patients without a known history of hypertension.
The foundation of management in hypertensive emergencies includes rapid identification of organ damage and prompt but partial (~25%) BP reduction within the first hour. Table
Acute ischemic stroke, aortic dissection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia are pathophysiologically distinct entities with specific BP targets, and their management is discussed elsewhere.
Care should be taken to avoid iatrogenic hypotension, which occurs in up to 15% of patients being managed for hypertensive emergencies and can aggravate target organ ischemia and cause devastating morbidity and mortality.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Patients with hypertensive emergencies will present with severely elevated BP (≥180/120 mm Hg). Up to 16% of hypertensive emergencies occur in patients without a history of hypertension.
Chief complaints will vary depending on the principal organ system experiencing damage. The practitioner evaluating the patient should assess for symptoms suggestive of organ damage, specifically focusing on acute effects on the brain, heart, aorta, kidneys, and eyes.
Basic diagnostic evaluation includes the following investigations:
CBC and basic chemistry panel to assess for acute renal insufficiency.
An ECG and cardiac troponin to evaluate for myocardial injury.
UA may reveal proteinuria or hematuria in patients with renal injury.
Chest X-ray or bedside U/S are useful for demonstrating pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure.
In patients with neurologic complaints, CT imaging of the brain may demonstrate hemorrhage or ischemia, although MRI is often needed for radiographic verification of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). 
Treatment
Ensure a patent airway, and supplement oxygen as needed.
Obtain bilateral, large-bore (ie, 18-20 g) peripheral venous access.
Initiate parenteral antihypertensive therapy only after identifying organ damage.
Consider arterial line placement for more accurate BP titration when using parenteral medications.
Target BP reductions of no more than 25% in the first hour.
Obtain expert consultation in cases where further stabilizing interventions may be necessary.
Disposition
Patients receiving titratable antihypertensive medications often require admission to a critical care unit.
Patients with asymptomatic hypertension (or symptomatic hypertension without evidence of end-organ damage) may be discharged for outpatient management after education and counselling.
Initiation of oral antihypertensive agents is not necessary from the ED but may be considered in select populations to gradually lower BP for long-term control.
Close outpatient follow-up and strict return precautions should be recommended.",Hypertensive Crises

Background
Epidemiology
Hypertension is a worldwide epidemic. One billion individuals are estimated to suffer from hypertension globally; by 2025, 1.6 billion will be affected. 
Hypertension is the most common risk factor for death globally, responsible for over 7 million deaths annually. 
Hypertension is also a treatable risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, and renal disease.
Despite being a treatable risk factor, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010 show that among patients with hypertension, 81.5% were aware of their condition, 74.9% were under treatment, and only 52.5% were controlled. 
In persons 40-70 y of age, each 20-mm Hg increase in systolic BP (SBP) or 10-mm Hg increase in diastolic BP (DBP) doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) across BPs ranging from 115/75 mm Hg to 185/115 mm Hg. 
Although the exact prevalence of hypertensive emergency is unclear, the proportion of patients who will experience a hypertensive emergency remains quite low. Among ED patients, 1%-6% will present with severe hypertension (>180/120 mm Hg); of those patients, less than half will have target organ damage. 
Risk factors for the development of hypertensive emergency include male sex, older age, greater mean DBP, and medication non-adherence. 
Definition and Classification
The Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines retained the same definitions of normal BP as the JNC 7 guidelines, with an average SBP <120 mm Hg and an average DBP <80 mm Hg.
The term prehypertension has been replaced by elevated BP. The upper end of prehypertension has been reclassified as stage 1 hypertension due to its approximately 2-fold increased risk of CVD compared to adults with normal BP.
This change in BP classification is estimated to result in a 14% increase in the prevalence of hypertension in the U.S. but only a 1.9% increase in adults requiring antihypertensive drug therapy. 
This classification system is used to help set guidelines for therapy, and although this system is appropriate for a non-emergency setting, the guidelines may not always extrapolate to patients in the ED setting. Nonetheless, these guidelines provide a model to follow when time and circumstances allow. 
It should be noted that the number cutoffs are arbitrary and based on consensus opinion from the JNC 8 and thus should be used in the context of the specific clinical scenario (ie, not all patients with markedly elevated BP have a hypertensive emergency).
Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of hypertension is multifactorial and highly complex, involving multiple organ systems and numerous independent or interdependent pathways. However, for the sake of simplicity, the remainder of this section will focus on hypertensive emergencies.
The initiating step in hypertensive emergencies is an abrupt rise in vascular resistance accompanied by a complex confluence of endothelial injury, neurohormonal imbalance, and autoregulatory dysfunction.  Figure
Endothelial injury and the release of hormonal vasoconstrictors from the blood vessel wall are thought to be precipitants. During the initial rise in BP, the endothelium maintains homeostasis through an increased release of vasodilator molecules such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin.  When hypertension is sustained or severe, these responses are overwhelmed, leading to endothelial decompensation, promoting further rises in BP and endothelial damage.
Endothelin, endothelium-derived contracting factors, and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α are released. Local activation of the clotting cascade also ensues with platelet and fibrin deposition, accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis of the arterioles.
Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) via catecholamine surge, endothelial vasoconstrictor release, or relative hypovolemia from pressure natriuresis leads to further vasoconstriction.  Increased RAAS activity also induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and vascular cell adhesion molecules, compounding vascular injury and vasoreactivity.
The normal negative feedback loop in the arterial baroreflex, in which vascular tone alterations occur in response to changes in BP detected by baroreceptors in the carotid sinuses or aortic arch, is impaired or disrupted. The anticipated sympathetic inhibition (decreased peripheral resistance) and increase in parasympathetic output (decreased heart rate and contractility) in response to an acute rise in pressure never occur, exacerbating the rising systemic BP and precipitating target organ damage. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Hypertensive emergency should be considered in any patient presenting with severely elevated BP (typically >180/120 mm Hg); however, normotensive individuals may develop hypertensive emergency at substantially lower BPs, in part because the adaptive vascular changes that protect organs from changes in BP have not developed. 
Up to 16% of hypertensive emergencies occur in patients without a history of hypertension.
The presence of concomitant illnesses and medications should be noted, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter preparations such as sympathomimetic agents, and illicit drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamines. Patients should be asked about immunosuppressive drugs, as these agents may predispose patients to hypertensive encephalopathy accompanied by only mild elevations in BP. 
The physical examination and clinical findings will be driven by the end organ involved in a patient’s hypertensive emergency.
Fundoscopic exam should be used to search for evidence of hypertensive retinopathy PhotoPhoto or papilledema Photo.
A third heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure, or crackles on lung examination suggest pulmonary edema.
New-onset mitral regurgitation murmur may signify papillary muscle rupture during an acute MI.
An abdominal bruit suggests renal artery stenosis, and an aortic aneurysm may be palpated in the abdominal examination.
Discrepancies in peripheral pulses and the murmur of aortic regurgitation suggest aortic dissection.
Focal neurologic findings, including visual field deficits and subtle cerebellar findings, are suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident or a mass lesion.
Delirium or depressed level of consciousness is found in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy or PRES. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Imaging tests are tailored to identify evidence of end-organ damage in the context of an appropriate chief complaint. Chest X-ray or bedside U/S may demonstrate findings consistent with pulmonary edema, whereas CT imaging is appropriate when intracranial hemorrhage or aortic emergency is suspected. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI is often required to confirm a clinical diagnosis of PRES. 
Bedside U/S conducted by an experienced clinician can be used to help identify acute aortic dissection, depressed myocardial function, and bladder outlet obstruction.
An ECG should be obtained to exclude acute myocardial ischemia and associated arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.
Laboratory Evaluation
Basic evaluation includes a chemistry panel to evaluate for metabolic derangements or the presence of acute kidney injury, as well as a CBC with a peripheral blood smear to search for microangiopathic anemia.
A bedside glucose check should be conducted in patients with altered sensorium or neurologic deficits to exclude acute hypoglycemia and to identify concomitant diabetes. 
Urine studies may reveal proteinuria or hematuria in patients with renal damage. Additional studies include pregnancy testing and a urine drug screen to help identify illicit substance use if the history is unavailable.
In select patients, measurement of plasma renin activity and aldosterone drawn at the time of admission can be useful in making a retrospective diagnosis.
Therapeutic Considerations
Management begins with appropriate monitoring including serial automated BP assessments, cardiac telemetry, and IV access.
BP reduction (typically with parenteral agents) should not be deferred while arrangements for admission or transfer to the ICU are being made.
An arterial line for continuous BP monitoring should be considered alongside the initiation of IV antihypertensive medications, as continuous monitoring can help identify and avoid further elevations and sudden drops in BP.  Precipitous drops in BP must be avoided, as they may aggravate target organ ischemia or infarction.
Most hypertensive emergency patients are volume-depleted due to the phenomenon of pressure natriuresis.  As such, IV fluid administration should be considered, which may prevent iatrogenic hypotension when antihypertensives are initiated. Diuretics should be reserved for patients with fluid overload.
The choice of antihypertensive agent should be tailored appropriately. Table Generally, titratable agents offer superior efficacy and safety but often require close monitoring and admission to the ICU.
In general, the goal of antihypertensive therapy in the setting of a hypertensive emergency is to lower the MAP by approximately 25% over several minutes to 1 h, depending on the clinical situation, in order to prevent further end-organ damage.  If the patient remains stable, BP should be reduced further over the next 2-6 h. If this BP is tolerated, further gradual reductions toward a normal BP can be implemented over the next 24-48 h. 
Exceptions to these guidelines include aortic dissection and hypertensive encephalopathy, both of which require more expeditious BP reductions.
Care should be taken to avoid iatrogenic hypotension, which occurs in up to 15% of patients being managed for hypertensive emergencies; this can aggravate target organ ischemia and carries devastating morbidity and mortality. 
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
After BP has been controlled for 12-24 h, oral antihypertensive agents may be initiated while the patient is weaned off IV agents.
Prevention of Hypertensive Emergency
Patients who suffer a hypertensive emergency are at increased risk for subsequent episodes of end-organ damage due to markedly elevated BP.
Adherence to the prescribed outpatient antihypertensive treatment is important to prevent both acute and chronic consequences of untreated high BP.
For patients who are non-compliant or non-adherent to oral antihypertensive agents, re-initiation/refill from the ED may result in improved BP control and engagement in therapy at the subsequent follow-up. 
Special Designation: Documentation
Hypertensive crises are emergencies, and as such, appropriate critical care time should be documented for these patients. This includes both direct and indirect patient care (ie, time spent evaluating the patient, speaking with family, interpreting studies, discussing the case with consultants, and chart review).
It is important to specifically document diagnoses, as coders cannot infer diagnoses from numbers. For example, if a patient has secondary hypertension, identify the source as renovascular, endocrine and link the specific underlying condition to the hypertension in documentation.
Documentation for a patient thought to have elevated BP without evidence of an end-organ damage hypertensive emergency should include a specific mention of the physical exam maneuvers that evaluated for this evidence, such as documentation supporting no evidence of chest pain, shortness of breath or pulmonary rales, neurologic changes, papilledema or fundoscopic abnormalities, changes in urination, or lower extremity edema.",Hypertensive Crises

If there is no whirring sound and cardiac arrest, start the resuscitation pathway with CPR and traditional care. Algorithm
End-point of resuscitations are clinical signs of improvement:
End-tidal CO2 in an intubated patient ≥20 mm Hg

Broad-spectrum antibiotics per local practice after cultures if there is concern for infection.
Call Cardiothoracic Surgery and the LVAD coordinator early for assistance.
Key Concepts
Patients with implantable devices (AICD, pacemakers, and assist devices) frequently present to the ED.
It is important that the emergency physician understand how these devices function, can recognize unique related issues, and is able to treat associated medical conditions.
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide mechanical circulatory support in patients with advanced heart failure (HF).
Second-generation continuous flow LVADs (cfLVADs) have largely supplanted first-generation pulsatile flow devices.
There are 3 significant indications for LVAD placement:
Bridge-to-recovery until the native cardiac function improves.
Bridge-to-transplant until a heart transplant.
Destination-therapy: Permanent placement in patients ineligible for a heart transplant.
Components:
Internal device components include an inflow cannula from the left ventricle, attached to the motor, with flow toward the outflow cannula anastomosed to the ascending aorta.
External device components include a driveline attached to the system controller that connects to the batteries.
LVAD patients have unique physical exam characteristics. Obtaining basic vital signs can be a challenge:
Most patients have no palpable pulse: Place on a cardiac monitor.
A manual blood pressure (BP) cuff is unreliable: Obtain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) using a manual Doppler, accomplished by attaching a manual BP cuff to the patient’s arm, inflating to at least 120 mm Hg systolic, and slowly deflating while placing a doppler probe over the brachial/radial artery. The first sound you hear will be the MAP.
Pulse oximetry can be unreliable due to the lack of pulsatility: Obtain an ABG early if the peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) has a poor waveform.
The majority of LVAD presentations to the ED are common diagnoses: Bleeding, infection, HF, arrhythmia, valvular insufficiency, stroke, dehydration, pain, musculoskeletal, access issues.
A stubbed toe in an LVAD patient is only a stubbed toe: treat the patient, not the implanted device.
Device-related complications that are critical to identify are:
Pump or battery failure
LVAD pump thrombosis
Drive-line-related infections
CPR/ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) is encouraged in LVAD patients, but instead of using pulse vs. pulseless algorithm, initiate resuscitation based on perfusion status, device failure, MAP, or end-tidal CO2. Algorithm
Key Diagnostic Elements
History
History should be thorough, with special attention to the following issues unique to patients with LVADs. Historical features concerning for acute HF should always be obtained.
Bleeding is the most common complication occurring in ~40% of patients. Enquire regarding a history of epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding.
Infection
The external drive-line is a common source of infection, with 20% of patients having infections within their first year of transplantation.
Neurologic complaints
Cerebrovascular events, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, are the leading cause of death in LVAD patients, with an annual incidence rate of ~8%.
Patients are generally not tPA candidates; thus, the treatment approach should prioritize endovascular therapies and reverse anticoagulation for hemorrhage.
Pump thrombosis is a difficult diagnosis, as many patients will have non-specific complaints. Enquire regarding chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, VAD alarms, hematuria, and jaundice.
Physical Exam
Evaluate for signs of acute HF.
Check for signs of infection (redness, erythema, tenderness) by removing the dressing on the drive-line (under sterile conditions) and carefully palpating and inspecting along the tract (for the Heartmate II device, also palpate the pump pocket site).
LVAD alarms
Do not ignore LVAD alarms; they serve as essential diagnostic tools.
The controller reports 4 values: Speed, flow, power, and pulse index.
Low-flow alarm:
Consider causes of hypovolemia (dehydration, medication-related, bleeding, etc.).
With clinical concern for right-sided HF, obtain an ECG to check for arrhythmia and an echo to evaluate for right ventricle (RV) failure.
High-flow alarm:
When combined with normal power, consider sepsis and distributive shock.
When combined with high power, pump thrombosis is high on the differential.
ECG
VAs occur in 22-59% of patients post-LVAD transplantation. It is not uncommon to see asymptomatic VT/VF, but given that the risk of RV failure is high, these arrhythmias should be urgently treated.
Most patients with LVADs already have an AICD or pacemaker.
Radiology
ECHO
Obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram.
Evaluate for both left- and right-sided HF symptoms, as RV failure occurs in 15-20% of patients.
Obtain an ECG ramp test; this is highly sensitive (100%) and specific (95%) for thrombosis.
CT can be utilized to identify a source of infection.
Laboratory Evaluation
Check for hemolysis by ordering lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, fractionated bilirubin, and urine analysis.
Look for subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) levels.
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) as indicated by the history and physical exam.
Treatment
Rapid IV access.
Place on a cardiac monitor and obtain a 12-lead ECG.
Call Cardiothoracic Surgery and the LVAD coordinator early for help.
Remember to obtain a manual Doppler pulse measurement.
Plug the device into an external battery source, auscultate over the chest to listen for a machinery whirring sound, check for alarms on the device indicating hardware malfunction.
If there is no whirring sound and signs of hypoperfusion, start the resuscitation pathway with CPR and traditional ACLS care.
End-points of resuscitations are clinical signs of improvement, end-tidal CO2 in intubated patients ≥20 mm Hg, and/or an arterial line MAP ≥50 mm Hg.
Resuscitation should be based on the diagnosis, with the following special considerations:
Pump malfunction
Inotropes with dobutamine or milrinone
Arrhythmia
Defibrillate early, as patients are often refractory to medical therapies.
Initiate standard post-ROSC care.
Sepsis
Broad-spectrum antibiotics per local practice after cultures.
Consider antifungal coverage early, consult the VAD team for local preference on crystalloid vs. colloid resuscitation fluid.
Start early antibiotics, as infected patients have a higher stroke risk.
Bleeding
Reverse INR for life-threatening bleeds.
Inotropic support
Dobutamine 0.5-1 µg/kg/min IV continuous infusion initially; then, 2-20 µg/kg/min OR

Background
Epidemiology
The prevalence of HF is estimated to be 5.7 million people in the U.S. and 23 million people worldwide. Approximately 10-15% of this group are categorized as end-stage HF, defined as having NYHA class IV symptoms. 
The LVAD was first implanted in 1966 by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey. From 2006-2016, almost 23,000 VADs have been implanted at a rate of 2,500 implants per year in the U.S.
The first generation LVAD was created as a pulsatile flow device, but in the current era >95% of implants are continuous flow VADs due to vastly improved mortality and morbidity benefits. The overall Kaplan-Meier survival for VADs implanted from 2006-2016 is 81% in year 1 and 70% in year 2. 
The initial FDA-approved indication for VAD placement was for bridge-to-transplant (BTT) or bridge-to-recovery (BTR), but recent data have demonstrated significantly reduced 1-y mortality in the LVAD group as compared with conventional medical therapy for end-stage HF in patients who are not transplant candidates, prompting the FDA to approve VADs for destination therapy (DT). Recently, we have seen a paradigm shift for device placement indication as more patients are receiving VADs for DT; from 2008-2011 71% had a BTT strategy, but in 2015-216, this dropped to 50%, with DT strategy increasing from 29% to 50%. 
The most common reasons for LVAD implantation are the requirement for progressive inotropic therapy and critical cardiogenic shock refractory to medical treatment. 
Device Function
VADs can be implanted as a right-VAD to unload the right ventricle, a left-VAD to unload the left ventricle, or a bi-ventricular device.
Many commercial devices are available, but we will focus on the FDA-approved devices, Heartmate (HM) II and III, along with the HeartWare (HVAD) device, which have the largest U.S. market share. The HMII device has an internal drive chamber containing a continuous rotary impeller pump implanted into the subdiaphragmatic space (a.k.a. pre-peritoneal pump pocket) with an in-flow conduit attached to the LV apex and outflow conduit attached to the ascending aorta. A percutaneous drive-line connected to the internal chamber comes out of the patient’s abdomen and attaches to the system driver, which is connected to an external battery pack. The HMIII and HVAD eliminate the pre-peritoneal pump pocket by attaching a miniaturized pump directly to the LV. 
The only moving component in VADs is the spinning rotary impeller pump, which propels blood from the LV into the aorta. The rotational speed (revolutions/min) of the pump is the only adjustable device parameter, but the system driver can report up to 4 measurements: Speed, flow, power, and pulse-index.
LVAD operating parameters include speed, flow, power, and pulse-index Table .
The flow (L/min) is an estimate of blood flow out of the pump and is proportional to the rotor speed and the amount of power.
The power is a measure of current and voltage applied to the motor.
The pulse index (PI) corresponds to the magnitude of the pulse flow and is an indirect measure of the patient’s native cardiac contractility and intravascular volume status. 
The maximum speed is determined by how much flow is available from the right heart; if the speed is too low, this leads to retrograde flow from the aorta back through the device into the LV; however, if the speed is too high, this leads to ventricular suction, resulting in LV collapse. 
Controller alarms
Often part of the presenting complaint to the ED.
Low flow or PI can indicate decreased preload states such as hypovolemia, RV failure, thrombosis, or inflow/outflow obstruction, but can also point to an acute elevation in afterload such as a hypertensive emergency.
High flow or power can be a sign of non-occlusive thrombosis. For PI increases, consider hypervolemia due to increased LV contractility Table. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
>90% of patients have an ED diagnosis that is not directly related to the device.
Bleeding, infection, and HF exacerbation are the most common reasons for ED presentation; however, hemorrhagic/ischemic strokes have the highest cumulative mortality and instantaneous death rate. 
Intracranial bleeding often co-exists with infections.
Adverse events are common post-VAD implantation, with the highest event rates in the first 3 months.
GI bleeding
Incidence rate of 23% (single-center studies up to 40%) and a recurrence rate of 9% in cfLVAD patients.
GI bleeding occurs at a higher rate than in the general population due to anticoagulation with both antiplatelets and warfarin, as well as development of acquired conditions including von Willebrand deficiency and GI angiodysplasia. 
Infectious complications
Second highest event rate, after bleeding. 
Enquire regarding pain, drainage, or itching along the drive-line site or the pump pocket for HMII.
Pump thrombosis
No sensitive or specific clinical features.
Can present with signs of hemolysis (fatigue, hematuria, scleral icterus), abnormal device alarms (high power, acute changes in PI), acute left HF, or fulminant cardiogenic shock. 
Aortic insufficiency
Common in patients with long-term cfLVADs.
Nearly 90% of patients eventually receive a diagnosis of aortic insufficiency, which does not seem to impact long-term mortality.
The etiology is multifactorial, relating to a higher-than-normal transvalvular pressure gradient across the aortic valve, which leads to commissure fusion and stenosis of the valve with subsequent regurgitation. 
RV failure
Complicates 10-40% of LVAD implants over time and presents with elevated JVP, edema, or ascites. 
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias
Common, occurring in up to 50-60% of LVAD patients with events, most often occurring within 30 d of implantation.
Arrhythmias may be asymptomatic, as LVADs maintain circulatory support independent of heart rate. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Chest X-ray and ECG should be standard tests obtained for all LVAD presentations.
MRI is an absolute contraindication for all VAD patients.
For occult GI bleeding
CT angiography can help to identify areas of hemorrhage with a diagnostic yield of 40% as compared with 53% for endoscopy.
Radionuclide scanning with technetium-labelled red blood cells has a reported 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity for any bleeding within the GI tract. 
Infection
CT with contrast can identify gas- or fluid-containing pockets.
Non-emergency (18F-FDG) PET/CT scanning demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity in identifying LVAD-associated infections in a small study. 
Pump thrombosis
Pump thrombosis can form in the LV, inflow cannula, motor, outflow graft, or aortic root. The motor is the most common location for thrombus formation.
The gold standard for non-invasive diagnosis of pump thrombosis is an echo ramp test (echos performed at different rotor speeds).
Regular 2-D echo typically fails to diagnose device thrombosis but can help to identify other conditions such as RV failure or aortic valve insufficiency. 
CT to identify thrombus is a poor rule-out test, with 13% sensitivity and 100% specificity; however, CT is helpful for non-thrombosis-related mechanical complications such as inflow cannula malposition and outflow graft obstruction. 
Send LDH (See below under: Laboratory Evaluation).
Laboratory Evaluation
Check coagulation, as LVAD recipients are anticoagulated with aspirin and warfarin, with a goal INR of 2-3. Specific parameters may change based on each patient’s prior history and institutional preference. 
LDH level >1,103 (~5× upper limit of normal) had 100% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity in identifying pump thrombosis. 
BNP
Levels decrease after LVAD implantation due to LV unloading.
Acute increases in BNP from the new baseline may occur during situations of inadequate circulatory support such as acute LVAD failure, pump thrombosis, HF, tamponade, or acute RV dysfunction. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Resuscitation
Unfortunately, CPR/ACLS is often delayed due to ambiguity surrounding resuscitation beginning and end points.
Resuscitation efforts should follow the current AHA guidelines:
Assist ventilation and assess perfusion (skin color, temp, cap refill).
If there is inadequate perfusion, assess LVAD function (check for alarms, listen for whirring sound).
If the LVAD is not working, attempt to fix it.
If unsuccessful, initiate the CPR/ACLS protocol. Algorithm
If the LVAD is working, but the MAP is <50 mm Hg and/or the end-tidal CO2 is <20 mm Hg, initiate the CPR/ACLS protocol. 
Blood Pressure Management
LVAD patients are very sensitive to increases in afterload. For a hypertensive urgency/emergency, the MAP goals are <90 mm Hg for HMII/HMIII and <85 mm Hg for HVAD. 
Bleeding
Life-threatening bleeding in LVAD patients requires early anticoagulation reversal, ideally with IV vitamin K and 4F-PCC.
DDAVP may be administered for acquired von Willebrand Factor deficiency, but this is unlikely to help.
Prospective small studies have shown that anticoagulation reversal appears safe following emergency bleeding events. 
Discuss reversal with consulting specialists for mild to moderate bleeding.
Due to the high association of bleeding complications with infections, strongly consider empiric antibiotics in patients with bleeding complications (especially intracranial bleeds).
Infection
The average time to the development of a percutaneous site infection is approximately 6 mo.
Obtain 2 sets of blood cultures (3 if there is a central line) and sterile percutaneous wound culture prior to initiating antibiotics.
Antibacterial coverage for drive-line-related infections should cover Staphylococcus including MRSA (accounts for ~75% of isolated species), Pseudomonas, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (skin flora). Other VAD-related infections include Enterococci, Candida, and Gram-negative species, especially Enterobacter & Klebsiella. 
Acute Ischemic Stroke
Prioritize endovascular therapies, as thrombolytics are generally contraindicated.
Consider pan-culturing the patient and starting broad-spectrum antibiotics, as systemic infection is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke. 
Ventricular Arrhythmias
Identify the underlying mechanism (volume overload or depletion, high or low rotor speed, electrolytes, pump thrombosis).
Arrhythmias are often refractory to medical therapy.
Use the maximum tolerated doses of beta blockers for medical therapy.
Anti-arrhythmics, such as amiodarone or lidocaine, can be used as a second-line therapy.
These medications are often ineffective at terminating the arrhythmia but may prevent long-term recurrence. 
Cardioversion is compatible with VADs, as long as the pads are not placed directly over the pump.
Suspected Pump Thrombosis
Initiate early anticoagulation with IV unfractionated heparin.
Provide IV hydration with or without forced diuresis to prevent renal injury from hemoglobinuria.
Consider alkalization of the urine with a bicarbonate drip. 
Myocardial Infarction
Rare event in cfLVAD patients, with zero patients requiring PCI for all visitors to the ED over a 5-y period at one urban academic medical center. 
Chest pain can be a symptom of other serious conditions such as thrombosis or HF.
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
Call the VAD coordinator for disposition assistance.
A multi-disciplinary approach is essential for taking care of this complex population, and patients should be transferred to corresponding VAD transplant centers once medically stable.
Most patients with a mechanical support device have a trained family member or friend to support them. Contact this individual to bring all the extra supplies and batteries.
Prevention
Single-center studies show high rates of unplanned readmissions from 55-82% for their respective VAD populations, with the primary causes of readmission being homogenous with the top three events of bleeding, infection, and neurological issues. An increased number of individual admissions is correlated with an increased mortality rate. Be prepared to see this highly comorbid patient group in your ED. ",Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD)
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Obtain a 12-lead ECG and IV access, and place the patient on a cardiac monitor.
If clinical presentation is concerning for acute coronary syndrome but the initial ECG is non-diagnostic in a patient with ongoing symptoms, obtain repeat ECGs.
Obtain serial ECGs every 15-30 min during the first hour in patients with ongoing symptoms, pending available resources.
A repeat ECG should also be obtained if the symptoms change significantly in intensity, or if the symptoms resolve.
Provide oxygen only if the patient is hypoxic or dyspneic.
Administer aspirin 162-325 mg as chewable, non-enteric coated tablet.
Give nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL for symptom relief unless the patient is:
Hypotensive
Inferior or right ventricular MI
Patient takes phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
Initiate intravenous nitroglycerin if there is a strong suspicion for ACS.
Usual starting dose 5-10 μg/min titrating by 20 μg/min q3-5 min to max of 400 μg/min, until pain resolves.
Send troponins and consider a CBC, BMP, and coagulation studies based on presentation. Send a d-dimer and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) if there is suspicion for a pulmonary embolism (PE) or heart failure.
Obtain a contrast-enhanced chest CT angiogram if there is concern for a PE or dissection.
Bedside echo can be a useful diagnostic adjunct, especially if there is concern for a pericardial effusion. Experienced clinicians can also use an echo to evaluate for wall motion abnormalities, valvular insufficiency, and evidence of congestive heart failure.
Patients diagnosed with ACS will require further treatment as outlined in the ACS Chapter. (See Chapter: Acute Coronary Syndromes)
Key Concepts
ACS initial Work Up Audio Review EM:RAP Audio, ACS Testing Audio review 2017 EM:RAP Audio ECG course on chest pain EM:RAP Video
Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for ED presentation, and accounts for significant healthcare expenditure.
Less than 10% of patients are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), although missed myocardial infarction remains one of the largest reasons for ED litigation.
The ED clinician should first consider the “big three” causes of chest pain, as well as other life-threatening diagnoses:
1. ACS
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
3. Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD)
4. Pericarditis/pericardial tamponade
5. Tension pneumothorax (PTX)
6. Esophageal rupture
The goal for ECG acquisition should be within 10 min of arrival when patients present with chest pain or other symptoms concerning for potential ACS.
Initial evaluation then includes obtaining a history, performing a physical exam, ordering imaging as indicated, and serial troponin testing if there is concern for ACS.
Once STEMI and NSTEMI have been “ruled out,” patients require risk stratification to determine the next steps in their evaluation.
Accelerated diagnostic pathways (ADP) that incorporate serial ECGs, troponins, and a risk score are useful in guiding disposition decisions.
While a variety of scoring methods exist, the HEART Score has been the most studied and most commonly used. Other scoring systems and ADPs, such as TIMI, ASPECT, ADAPT, and EDACS will be discussed in Deep Dive.
The HEART score is composed of 5 easy-to-remember elements of the evaluation, and is easily calculated at the bedside: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin.
Note: The HEART score  includes one troponin and the HEART pathway  includes a second troponin at the 3 hour mark. Other studies have used the 2 hour mark. 
Note: Neither the HEART score or the HEART pathway should be used in patients with STEMI, acute ischemic ECG changes, or known coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
Heart Pathway
Patients with a low score (≤3) are often suitable for discharge home with close outpatient follow-up.
Patients with a moderate-risk HEART score (4-6) are at a higher risk of MACE (major adverse cardiac event). Depending on the specific patient scenario, these patients may be admitted to the hospital, admitted to an observation unit, or undergo an expedited outpatient evaluation.
Note: MACE is defined as: AMI, PCI, CABG, coronary angiography revealing procedurally correctable stenosis managed conservatively, and death due to any cause. 
Note: MACE in the HEART pathway is defined as: a composite of death, MI, and revascularization. 
Patients with a high-risk HEART score (≥7) have an even greater risk of MACE. An individualized approach is recommended based on the specific patient scenario, the patient’s ability to follow up, and the pretest risk of MACE based on practice location. In general, high-risk HEART score patients will be admitted and undergo cardiac evaluation as inpatients.
After a negative ED evaluation, shared decision making (SDM) can facilitate provider-patient conversations regarding appropriate next steps.
All patients require discharge instructions with specific return indications, as well as directions for time-sensitive follow-up.
Pearls and pitfalls:
Always consider the “big three” in your initial differential.
Vital sign abnormalities require attention and recheck.
The ECG is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of ACS. Always compare current ECGs to old strips to avoid attributing old findings to current ischemia or failing to notice new changes.
Women, the elderly, and diabetics often present with atypical symptoms and anginal equivalents in lieu of chest pain.
Avoid prematurely settling on a psychiatric diagnosis in the anxious patient, as this is a common symptom of ACS, PE, and TAD.
Order a d-dimer in patients at a low to moderate risk of PE. Do not order this in “no risk” patients as there is a high false positive rate.
The HEART Score is used to risk stratify patients, but should not be used in patients with hemodynamic instability, dynamic ECG changes, or in whom there is significant concern for unstable angina.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Presentation
The traditional “classic” presentation of ACS is a gradual onset of exertional pain with radiation to the left arm and associated diaphoresis and dyspnea.
However, a significant proportion of the population (women, elderly, diabetics) may present with atypical symptoms, which include dyspnea, nausea, upper back pain, and fatigue.
History
History should include characterization of the chest pain or suspected anginal equivalent. While a variety of mnemonics exist, “OLDCAAAR” effectively captures all of the important elements of a chest pain history. 
OLDCAAAR: onset, location, duration, character, alleviating/aggravating factors, associated symptomes, activity at onset, and radiation.
Radiation to both shoulders/arms or the neck or jaw, diaphoresis, vomiting, exertional pain or pain similar to past ischemic events have the highest specificity for ACS.
In patients who report the sudden onset of symptoms, consider PE, TAD, or PTX.
Physical examination
First assess the patient for vital sign abnormalities such as hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia or hypoxemia. If the patient’s vital signs are abnormal, consider life-threatening conditions and re-check soon after.
Examine the patient for clues that may guide the differential diagnosis:
Absence of breath sounds (pneumothorax)
Rhonchi (infection)
New murmur or rub (myopericarditis, endocarditis, aortic dissection)
Rales, elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral lower extremity swelling/dependent edema (acute decompensated heart failure)
Unilateral leg swelling (PE, DVT)
Unequal pulses (aortic dissection)
Abdominal exam (ie, pulsatile mass, tenderness to suggest biliary or pancreatic etiology)
Neurologic deficits (consider TAD)
Reproducible chest pain
Pain reproduced with palpation significantly decreases the possibility that its etiology is ACS, but does not completely eliminate it. Documenting exact reactions when the chest is palpated, such as facial wincing, withdrawing from pain or yelling “ouch”, is recommended.
Testing
ECG
National guidelines  recommend the following goals:
Obtain the first ECG within 10 min of ED presentation in patients with presentations that are concerning for potential ACS.
If the clinical presentation is concerning for acute coronary syndrome but the initial ECG is non-diagnostic in a patient with ongoing symptoms, obtain repeat ECGs.
Obtain serial ECGs every 15-30 min during the first hour in patients with ongoing symptoms, pending available resources.
A repeat ECG should also be obtained if the symptoms change significantly in intensity or if the symptoms resolve.
Note that these ECG recommendations are to be considered goals for best practice, pending available resources in a busy ED.
Order serial troponins (conventional or high sensitivity) based on local treatment algorithms, with the second draw 2-3 h after the first. A single troponin is not usually recommended for ruling out ACS.
Consider other laboratory studies: CBC, BMP, d-dimer, or BNP based on presentation.
Order a chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumothorax, infiltrate, cardiomegaly, effusion, a mass, or signs of heart failure.
Consider CT imaging of the chest if there is concern for a PE or TAD.
A normal d-dimer alone should not be used to exclude TAD.
A bedside echo may assist in the diagnosis of pericardial effusion, heart failure, PE, or a wall motion abnormality.
Risk-assessment
The combination of a history, ECG, physical examination, cardiac troponin, and known risk factors can be integrated into one of the risk scores to estimate the short-term risk of cardiac events or death.
Risk factors for premature development of coronary artery disease include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking (or cessation <3 months), and positive family history (parent or sibling diagnosed with coronary artery disease <55 years of age).
Other more recently identified risk factors for premature development of coronary artery disease include HIV, systemic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic cocaine use, chronic renal disease, and chronic alcoholism.  The provider may choose to consider these factors as well when calculating the HEART score.
The HEART Score
The most substantial evidence exists in support of the HEART score. It is therefore the scoring tool that is most commonly used in the ED.
The HEART score is comprised of 5 easy-to-remember elements and is easily calculated at the bedside: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Table
Based on the composite score, patients then receive a low (0-3), moderate (4-6), or high-risk designation.
In validation studies performed in the Netherlands (with only a single troponin), low, moderate, and high-risk patients had a respective 2%, 16.6%, and 50% risk of 4-6 wk MACE. MACE was defined as mortality, PCI, CABG, or AMI within 4-6 wk of symptoms.
The HEART Score should not be used in patients with clear myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic instability, dynamic ECG changes consistent with cardiac ischemia, when there is already evidence of AMI, with known CAD or PVD, or when there is very high suspicion for unstable angina (UA).
Accelerated diagnostic pathways (ADP)
An ADP typically consists of a rule-out strategy with troponins, a risk score, and an algorithm for patient disposition.
Numerous ADPs currently exist (ie, ASPECT and ADAPT), but
Due to the popularity of the HEART Score, the HEART Pathway is the most commonly used and employs a 0 and 3 h troponin.
In the United States validation studies using the HEART Pathway ADP, patients with a low HEART score had a <1% risk of MACE within 4-6 wk of presentation. This group of patients was considered safe for ED discharge with close outpatient follow-up.
Treatment
Obtain IV access.
Consider telemetry if there is concern for ACS, an abnormal ECG, or vital sign abnormalities.
Give aspirin 162-325 mg as chewable, non-enteric coated tablet orally barring a contraindication (eg, previous anaphylaxis or active bleeding).
Nitroglycerin may be administered at a dose of 0.4 mg SL tablet or spray q5min or continuous intravenous infusion, usual starting dose 5-10 μg/min titrating by 20 μg/min q3-5 min to max of 400 μg/min, until pain resolves. Take caution when using nitroglycerin in patients being evaluated for a right-sided MI or in patients taking phosphodiesterase inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil). Monitor blood pressure closely.
Administer oxygen only in patients with hypoxia or tachypnea.
The routine use of morphine is no longer indicated for ACS.
Patients with diagnosed ACS will require treatment as outlined in the ACS Chapter. (See Chapter: Acute Coronary Syndromes)
Disposition
Home
Patients with a low HEART score (≤3) are good candidates for further evaluation as outpatients.
Patients with a moderate HEART score (4-6) have up to a 16.6% risk of MACE and may require further evaluation and observation.
Patients with a high HEART score (≥7) are usually admitted.
Outpatient follow-up
Patients require time- and action-specific follow-up recommendations in their discharge instructions. After a negative ED evaluation for ACS in a low-risk patient, follow-up may be with primary care or Cardiology.
2018 American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy recommends 1-2 wk follow-up in low-risk patients. This is a departure from the previous American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines that recommended outpatient stress testing within 72 h for discharged patients.
Admission
Patients with ischemic changes on ECG or elevated troponin levels should be admitted to the hospital. Nearly all patients with STEMIs and many patients diagnosed with NSTEMIs or UA will undergo cardiac catheterization during their hospitalization.
Consider admission to an ED observation unit or the hospital for patients who are not low-risk, or have circumstances that prevent timely outpatient follow-up.
Shared decision-making is recommended to assist in disposition decisions for all patients.",Low Risk Chest Pain
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
Chest pain accounts for over 10 million ED visits a year, with costs of care that exceed 10 billion dollars. 
Of the millions of patients evaluated in the ED each year, less than 10% are eventually diagnosed with ACS. 
One study of 7,266 patients with interpretable and nonischemic ECGs, non-concerning vital signs, and two negative troponins found that only 28 (0.4%) of these patients were later diagnosed with an MI. 
Of patients who do have an NSTEMI, the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is 0.79% at 6 mo and 1.65% at 18 mo. 
It is estimated that the diagnosis of ACS is missed in 1-2% of patients at the time of initial presentation. Missed ACS remains one of the most common causes of litigation in the U.S.
Pathophysiology
MI results when cardiac myocytes are not provided with adequate oxygen. This may occur from decreased perfusion caused by coronary occlusion from thrombosis or hemorrhage (Type 1 MI), or from a mismatch in oxygen delivery versus oxygen demand due to a low flow state such as hypotension, anemia or tachycardia (Type 2 MI). 
Risk factors for coronary artery disease include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking (or cessation <3 months), a positive family history (parent or sibling <55 years of age), and atherosclerotic disease (prior MI, CABG, PCI, CVA, TIA, or peripheral artery disease.
Diagnostic criteria for MI
Acute coronary syndrome typically occurs after the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, which may occur decades after plaque formation and progression. Plaque rupture exposes highly thrombogenic material that causes thrombosis, distal coronary artery embolization and/or intraluminal hemorrhage and resultant necrosis. 
AMI is diagnosed when there is at least one troponin level above the 99th percentile with rise and/or fall of the troponin AND at least one of the following:
Symptoms of myocardial ischemia
New ischemic ECG changes
Development of pathologic Q-waves
Imaging that demonstrates a new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormalities
Identification of a coronary thrombus
Imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand without an acute atherothrombosis (Type 2 MI)
Cardiac death, with symptoms of myocardial ischemia before troponin values are available or abnormal (Type 3 MI)
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
ACS may present atypically as shoulder pain, back pain, jaw pain, epigastric pain, fatigue, dizziness or even belching. An inferior MI may present as isolated epigastric pain.
Women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes, renal disease, or HIV/AIDS frequently present with “anginal equivalents” such as shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness, diaphoresis, or confusion. Less than half of women over 75 years of age will present with chest pain as their chief complaint.  Less than half of women over age 75 will endorse chest pain as their chief complaint
Anxiety may present as an “associated symptom” in patients with ACS, PE, or TAD. 
History
History should include characterization of the chest pain or suspected anginal equivalent.
The mnemonic “OLDCAAAR” can further assist with eliciting descriptors of the patient’s chest pain; it stands for: onset, location, duration, character, alleviating/aggravating factors, associated symptoms, activity at onset, and radiation. 
Onset
The sudden onset of chest pain should raise concern for TAD, PTX, and PE.
Location
Patients with ACS may complain of isolated back pain, substernal pain, jaw pain, neck pain, or epigastric pain.
Duration
Pain that only lasts for several seconds or, conversely, lasts continuously without waxing or waning for many hours or days is less likely to be related to ACS.
Characterization
The word “discomfort” is preferred when obtaining a history as patients, especially women, may be reluctant to use the word “pain.” Sharp or stabbing pain is concerning for TAD, PTX, and PE, but less likely to be due to ACS.
Alleviating or aggravating factors:
Symptoms that change with position may identify pericarditis or musculoskeletal chest pain, although the latter is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.
Pain that worsens with deep inspiration is more suggestive of PE or pericarditis.
Exertional pain is highly concerning for ACS.
Associated symptoms:
Associated dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness are non-specific.
Vomiting and diaphoresis in association with chest pain both have higher likelihoods for ruling in for ACS.
Radiation
Pain with ACS may radiate from/to the shoulders, jaw, neck, back or epigastrium.
Classic teaching suggests that radiation to the left arm is highly specific for ACS; however, radiation to the right arm has a higher specificity for ACS, and bilateral radiation is the most concerning.
Classic teaching suggests pain radiating to the back should raise concern for TAD.
Five historical factors most strongly associated with ACS include exertional discomfort, diaphoresis, radiation to the arms/neck/jaw, vomiting, and similarity to past (proven) ischemia. 
Past medical history
Major risk factors for premature development of atherosclerotic disease include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, other vascular disease (eg, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, TIA) and diabetes. Several other disease processes increase the risk of premature atherosclerotic disease and ACS, including HIV, lupus (and other systemic inflammatory conditions), chronic cocaine use, chronic kidney disease, chronic alcoholism, and possibly some cancers and their therapies. 
Both family and social history should be recorded. Ask about first-degree relatives with a history of CAD diagnosed before the age of 55, PE or venous thromboembolism, or a history of aortic disease. Smoking increases cardiovascular risk and is an important preventative target. Cocaine use can cause coronary vasospasm and also leads to premature coronary atherosclerosis. While modest red wine intake may be protective for CAD (though this is debatable), high levels of alcohol use are tied to increased atherosclerotic disease.
Physical examination
A complete set of vital signs should be obtained immediately, and abnormal vital signs require frequent rechecks. In particular, patients with unexplained tachycardia should be reassessed before discharge due to their increased risk of death within 7 d. 
In patients with a concerning clinical presentation, the following exam findings were each found to be highly predictive of ACS, with a specificity >95%:
Hypotension (SBP <100 mm Hg)
Tachycardia (HR >120 bpm)
Tachypnea
Rales on lung auscultation
Though not a critical finding, obesity is considered a major risk factor for ACS and is included in many risk scores.
The cardiac exam should include auscultation for a new murmur, rub, or diminished heart sounds. The presence of any of these findings should raise suspicion for acute valvular insufficiency, endocarditis, TAD, myopericardial syndromes, or tamponade.
The pulmonary exam may reveal signs of infection, heart failure, and pneumothorax.
Examine the thorax for reproducible pain. Pain reproduced with palpation significantly decreases the possibility that it is due to ACS, but does not completely eliminate it. Documenting the exact reaction to chest palpation, such as facial wincing, withdrawing from pain, or the patient yelling “ouch”, is recommended.
Examine the neck for jugular venous distention, as this raises concern for both heart failure and other etiologies of increased right-sided pressure.
The abdominal exam may reveal an alternate etiology for the patient’s discomfort, including biliary, pancreatic, or other gastrointestinal etiologies. Palpate for a pulsatile abdominal mass.
Assess the extremities for peripheral edema, asymmetric swelling, and bilateral pulses.
Check the skin for zoster or evidence of IV drug use.
Perform a neurologic exam, as focal deficits may be seen with TAD.
ECG
The ECG is the first and most important diagnostic test in patients being evaluated for ACS.
The initial ECG should ideally be obtained within 10 min of the patient’s arrival to the ED.
ECGs should be repeated in patients with recurrent or changing symptoms. Additionally, the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend repeating the ECG every 15-30 min for the first hour if concern exists for ACS but the first ECG is non-diagnostic. 
Note that these Guideline recommendations represent a goal for best practice and should not be interpreted as a standard of care. Serial ECGs every 15-30 minutes may not be tenable in a busy ED with limited personnel or resources. Nevertheless, it is ideal to get a repeat ECG at some point in a reasonably short period of time if the patient has concerning symptoms but the initial ECG is non-diagnostic.
Evolving changes on the repeat ECG(s) is predictive of ACS.
Comparison to an old ECG can prevent both the failure to notice new changes and inappropriate attribution of old findings to current ischemia.
Failure to recognize subtle ischemic changes may occur up to 12% of the time and results in significantly increased mortality and medico-legal risk.  Women in particular demonstrate smaller degrees of ST-segment elevation than their male counterparts and are more likely to present with NSTEMI than STEMI. 
Laboratory Evaluation
The ED evaluation of ACS will almost always include troponin testing.
Decisions to order other labs should be guided by clinical presentation.
Troponin
Cardiac troponin (cTn) is a protein used in cardiac muscle contraction. When there is cardiac cell death, there is a “leak” into the bloodstream. Elevated serum cTn indicates the presence of ACS.
Other conditions that may cause an elevated cTn level (in the absence of ischemic heart disease) include PE, dysrhythmias, cardiac contusion, cardiac procedures, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, TAD, sepsis, and decreased cTn clearance that may occur with acute or chronic renal failure.
Troponin rise
The first cTn level can be positive 2 h after symptom onset but is not reliably elevated until 6 h after infarction.
Sex-specific cut-offs are typically employed given the lower degree of cTn elevations seen in women.
A second cTn test is recommended 2-3 h after the first, depending on the timing of symptom onset (relative to ED presentation). There is some discrepancy as to the timing of the final cTn draw in relation to the onset of the patient’s chest pain, with recommendations ranging from 3  to 6 h after symptoms began.
There is no longer a place for creatine kinase muscle/brain (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase or other cardiac markers.
Highly-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hscTn)
The term “highly sensitive” describes the assay only and does not refer to the characteristics of the biomarker.
Newer hscTn assays allow for earlier detection of myocardial damage compared with contemporary troponin assays.
A disadvantage of hscTn measurements is that a slight troponin rise due to other causes may be mistaken for a myocardial infarction. For example, Shah et al, in a study of 48, 282 patients, found that the implementation of hscTn reclassified 17% of patients who were not identified by the contemporary assay, however, only one-third of these elevated troponins were caused by a type 1 myocardial infarction. 
European and Asian countries have been using hscTn for many years, but the assay was only recently granted FDA approval for use in the U.S. Implementation has been gradual but is expected to be widespread in the coming decade.
With hscTn, patients no longer have a positive or negative troponin but fall into one of three categories: undetectable, detectable but not elevated, or elevated. Cut-offs are assay-dependent.
Differentiating between the terms detectable but not elevated and elevated often causes confusion during patient evaluation.
Detectable levels of hscTn signify myocardial injury, but not necessarily due to myocardial ischemia. However, detectable levels of hscTn do correlate with future mortality and may also serve as a prognostic aid for other diagnoses (ie, syncope or sepsis). 
An elevated hscTn is indicative of myocardial ischemia and therefore confers the diagnosis of NSTEMI.
Rule-out strategies:
Numerous studies outline a variety of successful rapid rule-out strategies with hscTn; these range from employing serial hscTn to a single hscTn. 
A recent prospective observational multicenter study by Ljung et al examined the use of a single hscTn level at 0 h in expediting the discharge of low HEART score patients. Hospital length of stay was significantly reduced, with very few adverse events. 
The 2018 updated clinical policy by the ACEP outlines the integration of hscTn into the evaluation of ACS. As with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, serial hscTn levels are advised.  The 2018 ACEP clinical policy advises 0 and 2 h hscTn levels before considering discharge in low HEART score patients. However, low-risk patients with an undetectable initial troponin may be suitable for a single hscTn before being discharged from the ED. This stands to significantly decrease ED length of stay for a substantial portion of patients. 
False positives and negatives
False positive hscTn levels may be due to non-repeatable increases (so called ""flyers"") and/or heterophile antibodies or macrokinases.
Chronic skeletal muscle disease can also cause elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hscTn) levels.
False negatives are rare and usually due to anti-cTn antibodies.
HscTn assay values are lowered by hemolysis.
Supplemental biotin may also interfere with the assay, thereby producing lower values.
In summary, the use of hscTn provides the ability to exclude a MI sooner in some patients, but portends an increased frequency of false positive results.
Radiographic Evaluation
CXR
The CXR will usually be normal (80-90%) in patients who present with chest pain, but may occasionally reveal the underlying diagnosis (infiltrate, mediastinal widening, pneumothorax, mass, cavitary lesions, cardiomegaly, air under the diaphragm, rib fracture, or an osteolytic lesion). 
CXR has a sensitivity of 43.5% for pulmonary infiltrates. Reliance on CXR alone may therefore lead to a misdiagnosis. 
Frequently missed findings include an apical infiltrate or mass, right middle lobe or basilar infiltrate, cardiomegaly, small pleural effusions, and subtle acute or chronic changes. 
Pitfalls:
The CXR may be normal in patients with pneumonia if the patient is dehydrated or it is early in the disease process.
The mediastinum is normal 30-50% of the time in patients with an aortic dissection. 
PE with infarction may be confused with an infiltrate.
CXR findings in patients with acute decompensated heart failure can lag symptoms by hours.
Clinical correlation is always required.
ED ultrasound (U/S)
Bedside U/S performed by an experienced operator allows for rapid gross assessment of the heart for wall motion abnormalities, right ventricular enlargement or strain (which may suggest a PE), pericardial effusion/ tamponade, and valvular emergencies. It also permits screening for pulmonary findings such as pneumothorax, infiltrates, or pulmonary edema.
U/S alone should not be used to exclude acute ischemia.
ECHO
Formal echocardiography can be used to assist in planning and decision-making for revascularization in the setting of proven ACS, but lacks the diagnostic sensitivity necessary for excluding acute ischemia. 
Chest CT
Chest CT without IV contrast offers superior sensitivity for pulmonary infiltrates, pneumothoraces, and other non-cardiac etiologies of chest pain.
CT angiography (CTA) is the imaging test of choice in screening for PE or aortic dissection. CTA will also identify other pulmonary pathologies, including occult infiltrates, masses, vascular injury or abnormalities, and PNX.
In patients at a low or moderate risk for PE, a d-dimer should be ordered before deciding to proceed with a CTA.  (See Chapter: Venous Thrombosis)
CT coronary angiography (CTCA)
CTCA is used to image coronary artery anatomy.
CTCA is not widely available and is highly dependent on appropriate patient selection, heart rate, and the experience of the radiologist or cardiologist.
While some studies have effectively identified low-risk patients with CTCA, thereby permitting faster ED evaluation and discharge, others have not found any significant benefits from its use.  A systematic review and meta-analysis of over 10,000 patients showed that CTCA was associated with decreased rates of near-term MI compared with functional stress testing, but at the expense of increased angiography and revascularization and without a reduction in cardiac hospitalizations or deaths.  This was followed shortly thereafter by another meta-analysis that confirmed these findings and concluded that compared with other approaches, the use of CTCA is associated with similar major adverse cardiac events but higher rates of revascularisation in patients with acute chest pain.  Ultimately, no patient-oriented benefit has been identified.
At this time, the addition of CTCA to standard ED care has little immediate benefit except to mitigate diagnostic uncertainty.
Stress testing
The role of early stress testing has come under significant scrutiny as data continues to emerge that suggest little patient-oriented benefit of provocative testing given current risk stratification and management strategies.
Inappropriate patient selection, specifically the ordering of stress tests in low- and very low-risk patients, often results in false positive findings that lead to unnecessary downstream testing, invasive procedures, prolonged hospital lengths of stay, and associated iatrogenic risks to the patient.
The impetus for liberal testing stems largely from the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines, which recommend stress testing within 72 h in patients with suspected ACS, a normal ECG, and negative cardiac biomarkers. 
Given the financial and logistical barriers to obtaining short-term outpatient studies, emergency providers often feel compelled to admit patients (usually at observation status) for stress testing.
However, numerous studies question the utility of stress testing in the acute and subacute setting. The ability for a patient to undergo non-invasive cardiac stress testing within 72 h is difficult. However, the overall rate of adverse cardiac events is also extremely low.
A secondary analysis of the ROMICAT-II trial found that patients who underwent clinical evaluation alone vs. non-invasive testing had a shorter hospital length of stay, a lower evaluation cost, and underwent fewer downstream tests during the 28 d study period without a significant difference in adverse events during the follow-up period. 
Sandhu et al found that non-invasive testing in low-risk patients (either at 48 h or within 30 d of ED evaluation) significantly increased subsequent angiograms and revascularizations without reducing the 1 y admission rate for acute myocardial infarction. 
Most recently, a comprehensive retrospective analysis of nearly 8,000 patients evaluated for chest pain and discharged from the ED of an integrated health system found that just 31.3% of patients completed non-invasive stress testing within 72 h. However, the rate of 30 d major adverse cardiac events was low and not significantly different between those who completed stress testing within 72 h (1.1%) vs. those who completed stress testing within 30 d (0.8%) or did not complete any further testing at all (0.6%).  The results of this exploratory analysis led the authors to conclude that there does not appear to be any associated benefit of stress testing within 3 or 30 d compared with not receiving any testing at all, and that the lack of benefit combined with low rates of objective adverse events warrants the reassessment of current guidelines.
As a result of this recent and substantial evidence, the 2018 ACEP clinical policy recommends against using diagnostic testing such as stress testing, myocardial perfusion imaging, or CTCA before discharging low-risk chest pain patients in whom an acute MI has been excluded. 
An updated policy statement from the ACC and AHA is expected soon, but for the time being, emergency and cardiology researchers stress the need for individualized decision-making by the treating physician regarding the need for and timing of provocative testing. 
Therapeutic Considerations
ED Treatment
Obtain IV access.
Place the patient on a cardiac monitor if symptoms are ongoing, abnormal vital signs are recorded, or ECG findings are concerning for ischemia. Telemetry has not been shown to be useful in lower risk patients with resolved symptoms. 
Supplemental oxygen is no longer routinely administered to patients with suspected AMI but should be given to those with hypoxia or tachypnea. 
Administer aspirin 162-325 mg as a chewable, non-enteric coated tablet. Aspirin decreases mortality by 2.3% in patients with an acute MI (ISIS-2 Study Group, 1988).
Nitroglycerin can be given SL or IV for symptom relief but has no diagnostic utility. Avoid nitroglycerin in preload-dependent patients (ie, those who present with evidence of inferior or concurrent right-sided MI) and in patients on phosphodiesterase inhibitors (ie, sildenafil).
Sublingual nitroglycerin (SL NTG) should not be used as a diagnostic test to distinguish cardiac ischemia from non-cardiac causes of chest pain.
Chest pain from a gastrointestinal etiology may be decreased after the use of SL NTG, while chest pain from a cardiac etiology may be unchanged after the use of SL NTG. 
We recommend against the routine use of nitroglycerin without a high suspicion of ACS or ischemic ECG changes, as nitroglycerin has not been consistently shown to impact mortality or other patient-oriented outcomes and carries the risk of hypotension and iatrogenic harm. 
Avoid the use of nitroglycerin ointment, as its absorption and efficacy can be erratic and unpredictable. 
“GI cocktail”/medications (eg, antacids, viscous lidocaine) should not be used as a diagnostic modality. 
IV beta blockers are not recommended in patients with acute cardiac ischemia, and therefore are not recommended before a diagnosis of ACS is ruled out. 
Disposition
Patients with STEMI require transfer to the cardiac catheterization suite, with a door to balloon (D2B) goal of less than 90 minutes. (See Chapter: Acute Coronary Syndromes)
Disposition of the ED chest pain patient is predicated on the premise that other life-threatening etiologies that present with chest pain have been ruled out. These include PE, TAD, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, esophageal rupture, pneumonia/pulmonary abscess, lung cancer, and multiple rib fractures.
Risk Stratification
Once STEMI, NSTEMI, and other immediately life-threatening diagnoses are ruled-out, the ED provider should risk-stratify patients to determine disposition. The goal is to keep those patients who will benefit from observation and further testing, while preventing unnecessary testing in those who can be safely discharged.
Many emergency providers are still not comfortable with even a very small risk, with one widely quoted study showing that one-third of emergency medicine physicians were not comfortable with a risk of MACE of 1/1000 or less. 
The 2018 ACEP Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Evaluation and Management of Emergency Department Patients With Suspected Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes stresses the need to avoid harm associated with false positive tests, and deems a missed diagnosis rate of 1-2% for 30-day MACE as acceptable for the majority of patients and providers. 
There are multiple risk stratification systems for guiding the disposition of chest pain patients after a negative ED evaluation. The HEART score and the HEART pathway are currently the most well studied and implemented.
The HEART score
The HEART Score should be used in the context of each patient’s individual presentation and should not be applied in cases of clear myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic instability, dynamic ECG changes, AMI, or suspected UA.
The HEART score is composed of 5 easy to remember elements and is easily calculated at the bedside: History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin. Table
Based on the composite score, patients then receive a low- (1-3), moderate- (4-6), or high-risk (7-10) designation.
The lower the HEART score, the lower the risk of MACE, which is defined as myocardial infarction (MI), death, or revascularization within 30-45 days.
Patients with a low HEART score are candidates for ED discharge.
Patients with a moderate-risk HEART score are at a higher risk of MACE. Depending on the specific patient scenario, these patients may be admitted to the hospital, admitted to an observation unit, or undergo an expedited outpatient evaluation.
Patients with a high-risk HEART score have an even greater risk of MACE. An individualized approach is recommended based on the specific patient scenario, their ability to follow up, and the pretest risk of MACE based on practice location. In general, high-risk HEART score patients will be admitted and undergo cardiac evaluation in the hospital.
The original studies of the HEART score employed a single conventional troponin upon arrival at the ED, regardless of the time that had elapsed since the onset of chest pain. Even with a single contemporary troponin, the HEART score was highly accurate at ruling in and ruling out MACE 30-42 d after symptom onset.  Patients with a low-risk HEART score (≤3) have a short-term MACE risk of 0.9-1.7% at 4-6 wk after symptom onset. Moderate- and high-risk scores confer a respective MACE risk of 13-17% and 50% at 4-6 wk, and these patients typically require hospital admission. Table
In a meta-analysis of over 25,000 patients, those with a low-risk HEART score demonstrated an overall MACE risk of 2.1%, although the risk in North American patients was only 0.7%. 
Use of the HEART Score is now supported by ACEP as a level B recommendation: “In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation, the (HEART) score can be used as a clinical prediction instrument for risk stratification. A low score (<3) predicts 30-day MACE miss rate within a range of 0% to 2%.”  EM:RAP Video
Accelerated Diagnostic Pathways (ADPs)
An ADP is a standardized rule-out algorithm that consists of serial ECGs, troponins, and a risk score that serves to identify low-risk patients safe for ED discharge.
ADPs for evaluating chest pain rest on the concept of serial troponins, a tenant that is supported by the ACC, AHA, and ACEP. 
In a blinded data review of over 40,000 patients by Weinstock et al., those patients with interpretable and non-ischemic ECGs, non-concerning vital signs, and two negative troponins had an exceedingly low-risk of a clinically relevant adverse cardiac event, which includes life-threatening arrhythmia, STEMI, and arrest or death during the inpatient or OBS timeframe (two patients out of 7,266). 
Numerous ADPs exist, but the HEART Score and the HEART Pathway are most commonly used. Other popular ADPs include ASPECT, ADAPT, and EDACS.
The HEART Pathway
The HEART Pathway adds a second troponin at 3 h after arrival, resulting in an even lower risk of MACE for patients in the low HEART category. This ADP has now been validated in the U.S. In a randomized study of 4,761 patients, use of the Heart pathway increased the rate of early discharge by 21% and decreased the need for cardiac testing by 12% over 30 d. No MACE events occurred in patients identified as low-risk. Of the 31% of patients identified as low-risk, 0.4% had a MI or death within 30 d.  Algorithm
ASPECT ADP
Both the ASPECT and ADAPT ADPs use the TIMI score. Unfortunately, the TIMI score was not designed for use in the acute setting and has been shown to have limited applicability in the ED. 
MACE for both the ASPECT and ADAPT ADPs is defined as death, cardiac arrest, coronary revascularization, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmia requiring intervention, and AMI within 30 d.
TIMI Score:
The TIMI score consists of 7 elements that are associated with a higher risk of ACS. Each element is scored with 0 or 1 points, resulting in a total score of 0 to 7. Patients with a low TIMI score (≤1) have a short-term MACE risk of less than 5%. Table
The initial ASPECT ADP used conventional troponin, myoglobin, and CK-MB testing at 0 and 2 h in combination with a non-ischemic ECG and a TIMI score of 0 to identify low-risk patients.
ASPECT has been prospectively validated and displays a 99.3% sensitivity and a negative predictive value of 99.1% in the low-risk group. 
ADAPT ADP
The ADAPT rule expanded the low-risk group to include TIMI scores of 0 and 1, and utilized only contemporary troponin (CK-MB and myoglobin were dropped) at 0 and 2 h. Low-risk patients had a MACE risk of 0.25%.
In the Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndrome Evaluation (APACE) validation study, investigators employed a high-sensitivity troponin at 0 and 2 h in 909 patients, of whom 40% were low-risk. This ADP had a sensitivity of 99.4% and a NPV of 99.7%.
EDACS
The EDACS ADP is the first risk score that is derived from an ED patient population.
EDACS consists of 7 patient- and chest pain-specific characteristics. Each element carries a different weight, with up to half of the points determined by age in elderly patients. Table
The EDACS rule is combined with a non-ischemic ECG and 0 and 2 h troponins. Table
Patients with an EDACS score of ≤16 and a non-ischemic ECG and two negative troponins showed 0% risk of MACE in the validation study and therefore can be safely discharged from the ED.
The disadvantage of the EDACS score is that it requires a computer or calculator, which makes it more difficult for bedside use in a busy ED.
Shared decision making (SDM)
Shared decision making involves presenting 2 or more reasonable options and discussing the risks and benefits of each with the patient. This differs from informed consent, in which the patient agrees to undergo the treatment recommended by the ED provider.
SDM serves as a useful tool for improving provider-patient communication, increases patient understanding of his/her diagnosis and ED course, and ultimately assists in determining final disposition and related risks. 
SDM has not been shown to require more time than usual care
SDM also provides reassurance to ED providers, who are often reluctant to discharge even low-risk patients. 
Supporting evidence:
Erik Hess et al randomized almost 900 patients to either usual care or SDM facilitated by a decision aid, and found that the patients in the SDM arm had greater knowledge of their risk for ACS and less frequently decided to be admitted for stress testing. Importantly, there were no major adverse cardiac events that resulted from the intervention. 
The results of a randomized vignette-based simulation by Schoenfeld et al evaluated the impact of SDM in the setting of adverse outcomes and found that the use of SDM confers medicolegal protection, with participants 73% less likely to contact a lawyer to discuss litigation after being engaged in the decision for discharge despite a diagnosis of appendicitis (a common surrogate for higher-risk ED discharge). While the authors caution that the desire to avoid litigation should not be the underlying rationale for using SDM, the results of their study support the idea that respectful and patient-centered communication may be medicolegally protective in the event of an adverse outcome. 
In their 2017 publication ""Shared decision making in the emergency department: a guiding framework for clinicians,” Probst et al provide a useful reference for clinicians using SDM in the ED. 
The use of visual or multimedia patient decision aids, also known as “decision support interventions”, have the potential to standardize the SDM process and further engage patients in the decision process while encouraging understanding and exploration of their preferences. 
While the decision to discharge home even low-risk chest pain patients is complex, SDM can facilitate safe, appropriate, and timely care as an outpatient instead of in the hospital.

Follow-up
In low-risk patients in whom MI has been ruled out but ACS is still a possibility, follow-up per the 2018 ACEP Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Evaluation and Management of Emergency Department Patients With Suspected Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes is recommended within 1-2 wk. If follow-up is not available within this timeframe, consider observation or further testing. ",Low Risk Chest Pain

Key Concepts
Patients with implantable devices (AICD, pacemakers, and assist devices) frequently present to the ED.
It is important that the emergency physician understand how these devices function, can recognize unique related issues, and is able to treat associated medical conditions.
Pacemakers are implantable cardiac devices that electrically stimulate the heart, thus delivering an impulse producing a life-sustaining rhythm in the setting of an abnormal or absent native rhythm.
Common indications for pacemaker placement include:
Symptomatic bradycardia
High-grade AV blocks
Chronic bifascicular blocks
Neurocardiogenic syncope, severe
Severe systolic heart failure (cardiac resynchronization therapy)
Pacemaker nomenclature includes a 5-letter coding system. The first 3 letters, or positions, are most critical to emergency physicians:
Position 1: Chamber(s) being paced (A-atrium, V-ventricle, D-dual)
Position 2: Chamber(s) being sensed (A-atrium, V-ventricle, D-dual)

Background
Epidemiology
The first permanent pacemaker was implanted in the U.S. in 1960.
In 2009, over 185,000 pacemakers were placed in the U.S.
The most common pacemaker implanted in the U.S. is a DDD.
>80% of pacemakers implanted in the U.S. are dual-chambered.
The FDA conservatively reports 1.3 pacemaker malfunctions/1,000 persons/y. 
Pathophysiology
Indications for pacemaker placement include:
Symptomatic persistent or intermittent bradycardia
AV block: 2nd-degree type II or 3rd degree (persistent or paroxysmal)
AV block: Symptomatic 2nd-degree type I
Sinus node disease
Sinus arrest with prolonged pauses and syncope
Bundle branch blocks and syncope
Chronic bifascicular blocks
Neurocardiogenic syncope
Severe systolic HF (cardiac resynchronization therapy)
Components & Function
The pacemaker consists of 2 major components:
The generator, which includes the battery and electrodes
The leads
The pacemaker lead tip electrodes can sense the electrical activity of the myocardium and carry the signal to the generator, as well as deliver the electrical stimulus from the generator to the myocardium.
The tip electrodes are fixed in the myocardium by an electrically active helix or inert lines that anchor the lead. The electrodes are separated from the conducting leads by insulation. 
Nomenclature
Common pacemaker nomenclature is fully defined by a 5-position code.
For the emergency physician, the first 3 letters are of critical importance.
Position 1 describes which chamber is being paced: The right ventricle (V), right atrium (A), or dual (D).
Position 2 describes which chamber is being sensed: The right ventricle (V), right atrium (A), or dual (D).
Position 3 describes the response capabilities of the pacemaker: Inhibit (I), trigger (T), both inhibit and trigger, or dual (D), and no response (O).
Inhibit response implies that the pacemaker can be inhibited or suppress its function in the event of native, normal cardiac activity.
Trigger means that the pacemaker can be triggered or activated in the absence of native, normal cardiac activity.
Having the ability to be triggered or inhibited allows for a more efficient device that only works when necessary, preserving battery and device life.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The most common pacemaker-related malfunctions are failure to pace, failure to capture, failure to sense, and pacemaker-related tachycardia. Less commonly encountered problems include Twiddler’s syndrome, pacemaker syndrome, and runaway pacemaker.
Failure to pace
Defined as the failure of the pacemaker to deliver an electrical stimulus to the heart. Patients, particularly pacemaker-dependent ones, will present with symptoms related to dysrhythmia and/or hypoperfusion as a result of output failure.
Diagnosis is made based on the absence of pacemaker activity or spikes on 12-lead ECG.
Failure of an atrial lead to pace will result in a lack of atrial spikes.
Failure of a ventricular lead to pace will lead to the absence of ventricular spikes.
Do not rely on cardiac monitors to make this diagnosis, as pacer spikes may be difficult to identify on monitors or rhythm strips printed from monitors.
Common causes:
Oversensing: The pacemaker is inappropriately inhibited by external signals such as:
Skeletal muscle myopotentials, especially rectus abdominis or pectoralis contractions.
Diaphragmatic contractions during the hiccups.
EMI (ie, MRI, smartphones).
Normal cardiac signals
Such as when an atrial pacemaker lead senses a QRS complex or T wave and mistakes it for a P wave, leading to inappropriate inhibition of the atrial pacemaker function.
This is avoided by programming a built-in “refractory period” for the atrial sensor, such that it will not sense any cardiac signals for a set period of time following the atrial spike.
“Make break” electrical signals created from intermittent metal-to-metal contact in the setting of an insulation defect, lead fracture, or loose connections. 
Lead failure
Common cause of pacemaker malfunction. This has a higher risk of occurring in the setting of trauma, acute entry angle, sharp turn in the generator pocket, tight sutures, or movements that can lead to pulling of the insulation or lead itself. 
Lead fracture or dislodgement prevents delivery of the electrical stimulus from the pacemaker generator.
Battery end-of-life or failure.
Component failure, usually due to blunt trauma.
Pseudomalfunction: The pacemaker is correctly and appropriately inhibited by the presence of regular cardiac activity. The practitioner erroneously interprets the absence of pacer spikes as a malfunction or failure to pace.
Failure to capture
Defined as the myocardium’s failure to respond to the pacemaker’s electrical stimulus, resulting in the absence of myocardial depolarization or capture.
Diagnosis is made by the absence of myocardial depolarization following a pacer spike. In atrial pacemakers, this will appear as an atrial pacer spike that does not result in a P wave. In ventricular pacemakers, this will appear as a ventricular pacer spike that fails to produce a QRS complex.
Causes of failure to capture can be a result of:
Low current output
Allows for enough current to result in a pacer spike on the ECG but not enough to cause myocardial depolarization. This can be caused by:
Lead fracture, dislodgement, or an insulation problem
Battery end-of-life or depletion
Elevation in the myocardial voltage threshold
The myocardium requires a higher voltage to result in depolarization.
This occurs commonly in the week following pacemaker placement as a result of tissue changes at the electrode-myocardium interface. 
Myocardial ischemia can also elevate the pacing threshold, as ischemic tissue is more difficult to conduct electricity through compared with normal healthy myocardium.
Metabolic derangements including hypothyroidism, hypoxemia, acidemia, and electrolyte disturbances (especially hyperkalemia) can also increase the pacing threshold.
Medications (especially antidysrhythmics), usually at supratherapeutic levels, can elevate the pacing threshold.
Flecainide can do this even at therapeutic levels. 
Isoproterenol is effective in a patient with failure to capture due to supratherapeutic antidysrhythmic levels. 
External defibrillation can cause inability to capture in >50% of patients with pacemakers. 
Failure to sense (or under-sensing)
Is the pacemaker’s inability to detect native, normal cardiac activity, resulting in inappropriate and unnecessary pacing.
A 12-lead ECG will reveal a native P or QRS wave preceding a pacer spike.
Causes of under-sensing include:
Processes that result in a change in the amplitude, vector, or frequency of the native signal, including ischemia, bundle branch blocks, ventricular dysrhythmias, and atrial dysrhythmias. 
Lead dislodgement, lead fracture, or insulation problems, in addition to battery problems, can cause a failure to sense, as the lead is unable to carry the signal from the myocardium to the pacemaker generator.
Defibrillation can lead to under-sensing by damaging the pacemaker directly or transiently disrupting the sensing function.
Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT)
A re-entrant tachycardia that can occur with dual-chambered pacemakers, whereby the pacemaker itself is a part of the re-entry loop.
PMT is typically precipitated by premature ventricular contractions or magnet removal (if a magnet has been placed on the patient for another reason).
There are reports of PMT triggered by the noises or vibrations caused by medical helicopter transport, heavy machinery, or sleeping on the side of the implant.
Premature ventricular contractions can be conducted in a retrograde fashion through the AV node, resulting in atrial depolarization. This atrial depolarization then triggers the pacemaker to generate a ventricular spike and paced beat, completing the loop endlessly.
Since the pacemaker is part of the re-entry loop, the rate of the tachycardia cannot exceed the programmed upper limit of the pacemaker, usually <180 bpm.
Runaway pacemaker
Rare but life-threatening emergency. Occurs as a result of pacemaker malfunction resulting in rapid inappropriate discharges.
Unlike PMT, the discharge rate can exceed the upper limit of the pacemaker.
Pacemaker syndrome
Occurs as a result of AV dyssynchrony in patients with a single-chambered pacemaker, which may present with cannon A waves upon exam (increased jugular venous pulsation as a result of the transmitted high pressure of simultaneous atrial and ventricular contraction).
Loss of the atrial “kick,” which can contribute up to 20% of cardiac output, can lead to a constellation of symptoms related to decreased perfusion, including fatigue, weakness, headache, lightheadedness, syncope, and dyspnea or orthopnea.
Twiddler’s syndrome
Pacemaker failure to sense or pace caused by lead dislodgement as a result of the patient “twiddling” or manipulating the pacemaker generator in the pacemaker pocket.
This can occur if there is a paucity of subcutaneous tissue to anchor the PM in the pocket or if a large pacemaker pocket is created in an obese patient.
It is more common in elderly women, children, or patients with underlying developmental, cognitive, or psychiatric disorders.
Repetitive arm movements can lead to unintentional Twiddler’s syndrome. 
Diagnosis is based on chest radiograph, demonstrating lead dislodgement as the pacemaker leads coil around the generator.
Reverse Twiddler’s syndrome occurs when the pacemaker generator is manipulated such that the leads are advanced further into the heart, resulting in pacemaker malfunction due to loss of electrode contact with the appropriate location within the heart. 
ECG
Atrial pacemakers
Identified by a pacer spike preceding the P wave.
The P wave will have a normal morphology.
Absence of a pacer spike could indicate failure to pace or simply pseudomalfunction.
Ventricular pacemakers
Identified by a pacer spike preceding the QRS complex.
The QRS complex will be wide and have typical left bundle branch block morphology, as the right bundle of His depolarizes ahead of the left bundle of His based on the location of the pacemaker wire in the right ventricle.
Absence of a pacer spike could indicate failure to pace or simply pseudomalfunction.
Physical Exam
Check the pacemaker pocket for signs of infection, wound dehiscence, or device extrusion.
Perform a cardiac exam, listening for a new murmur (endocarditis), S3 or S4 (HF), and muffled heart sounds or rubs (effusion).
Auscultate lungs for bilateral breathing sounds (pneumothorax) or signs of HF.
Examine the extremities for edema (HF) or signs of upper extremity thrombophlebitis (pain, swelling, redness of ipsilateral upper extremity).
Inspect skin for splinter hemorrhages, Osler’s nodes, and Janeway lesions if endocarditis is suspected.
Radiographic Evaluation
Chest X-ray
Use X-ray to distinguish single, dual-chambered pacemakers from cardiac resynchronization therapy and AICDs.
A single-chambered pacemaker will have only one lead traveling from the generator to the myocardium.
A dual-chambered pacemaker will have two leads, one traveling from the generator to the right atrium and one to the right ventricle.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy will have the same two leads as the dual-chambered pacemaker, with an additional third lead traveling through the coronary sinus to the free left ventricular wall.
An ICD can be distinguished from a pacemaker by the presence of thick white coils.
Device identification
X-ray can also assist in identifying the manufacturer of specific pacemakers if the patient is unable to provide this information.
A radiopaque alphanumeric code (ANC) is marked onto each device for identification and is unique to each manufacturer.
If the ANC is not identifiable, the orientation of the battery, as well as the shape of the can, can help to distinguish different manufacturers. 
Chest X-ray can also assist with the diagnosis of lead fracture, lead displacement, Twiddler’s syndrome, and reverse Twiddler’s syndrome.
Utilize bedside echo to look for pericardial effusion and/or tamponade physiology.
CT can further characterize the presence and depth of pocket infection.
Laboratory Evaluation
Troponin
Should be sent to identify myocardial ischemia as a possible source of pacemaker malfunction, particularly with failure to capture and failure to sense.
The vague symptoms of pacemaker syndrome also warrant an ischemia work-up.
Electrolyte abnormalities including hypo/hyperkalemia, hypo/hypercalcemia, and hypo/hypermagnesemia can result in pacemaker malfunction, particularly failure to capture.
Medication levels for which plasma can be drawn and readily measured in the ED should be evaluated. This includes phenytoin and digitalis.
Obtain blood cultures in the setting of suspected lead or pocket infection.
Therapeutic Considerations
In failure to pace, treatment begins with the application of a magnet.
This reverts the pacemaker to asynchronous mode, turning off the sensing function, and sends a signal to the pacemaker to begin pacing.
If magnet application results in normal pacing function, the malfunction was likely due to over-sensing.
If magnet application results in slow pacer spikes, the battery is nearing the end of its life.
If magnet application results in no pacer spikes, there is total pacemaker failure, and it needs to be replaced.
In failure to capture, treatment is targeted to finding a reversible cause such as metabolic derangements, medication toxicity, or myocardial ischemia.
If failure to capture is due to suspected or known toxic levels of class I agents, specific treatment with sodium bicarbonate or 3% hypertonic saline can help.
In failure to sense, treatment is targeted to the underlying cause.
In the absence of a lead or battery problem requiring pacemaker replacement, reprogramming the pacemaker to a higher sensitivity can correct under-sensing.
In PMT, diagnosis and treatment are to place a magnet over the pacemaker, which should break the PMT.
Other treatment modalities for PMT, with varying success rates, include IV adenosine, carotid massage, precordial thump (not directly over the pacemaker), or transcutaneous pacing.  These alternative therapies may be required if magnet placement does not terminate the PMT or if a magnet is unavailable.
In runaway pacemaker, placement of the magnet may slow the rate enough to stabilize the patient until emergency device reprogramming or replacement can occur.
If the magnet fails, the pacemaker leads must be disconnected or cut immediately.
In pacemaker syndrome, treatment is mostly supportive in the ED. Definitive treatment is usually the replacement of a single-chambered with a dual-chambered pacemaker.
Twiddler’s syndrome requires replacement of the pacemaker.
Reverse Twiddler’s syndrome can often be corrected by the electrophysiologist without the need for pacemaker replacement or surgery, as the device remains sterile, and typically the leads should be pulled back and placed in the correct position again.
Special Considerations
Defibrillation in patients with pacemakers can damage the device itself, alter the sensing function, or reprogram the device, causing pacemaker dysfunction.
Defibrillation paddles should not be placed directly over the device. Instead, place the pads in an anterior-posterior fashion, perpendicular to the axis of the pacemaker generator and as far from the pacemaker as possible.
After defibrillation, the pacemaker should be interrogated and, if needed, reprogrammed.",Pacemakers
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Initiate unfractionated heparin 80 units/kg IV bolus, followed by an infusion of 18 units/kg/h.
Possible exception: If the limb ischemia is attributed to emboli from an aortic aneurysm (discuss with a vascular surgeon).
Systemic thrombolysis is usually not indicated.
Seek Vascular Surgery consultation early in the patient’s course.
Endovascular and/or surgical therapies will be decided by the vascular surgeon based on etiology, duration of symptoms, and degree of malperfusion.
Key Concepts
Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency that threatens tissue viability and is caused by the sudden loss of perfusion to an extremity.
Acute onset is defined as occurrence within 2 wk; this may present as a sudden new event or a worsening of existing peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
Lower extremities are most commonly affected, but the upper extremities can also be involved.
The “6 Ps” of acute limb ischemia: Pain, pallor, paresthesias, poikilothermia, pulselessness, and paralysis.
Treatment is based on the duration and severity of these symptoms.
Loss of sensation or motor function is an ominous finding, often prompting immediate surgical intervention.
CT angiography is usually the initial test of choice in the ED.
Acute medical therapy can include aspirin and heparin.
Vascular Surgery should be consulted expeditiously in cases of ALI.
Be mindful of proximal and systemic diseases that can cause limb malperfusion (aortic dissection, aneurysm, or occlusion, atrial fibrillation, endocarditis, prosthetic cardiac valves, vasculitis, etc.).
Key Diagnostic Elements
Ischemia is defined as acute if symptoms have been present for <2 wk.
Of the 6 Ps, pain is often the first symptom. Motor deficits reflect severe, limb-threatening ischemia.
Physical examination of the affected limb should include:
Pulses (with a handheld doppler, since tactile palpation is unreliable), capillary refill, skin color, warmth or coolness, presence of ulcers or gangrene, sensation, and motor function should be documented.
A comparison should be made with the non-affected limb to establish a baseline assessment.
Cardiac examination should check for pulse irregularity and murmur, because these can point to an embolic cause.
Signs of pre-existing chronic limb ischemia include loss of hair, muscle atrophy, or presence of ulcers. Typically, these signs of ischemia will be present bilaterally, including a decreased pulse in the contralateral extremity.
An ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.9 suggests impaired perfusion and implicates the arterial system as the source of symptoms until proven otherwise.
The most common cause of ALI is thrombotic occlusion (85%). The second most common cause is an embolic event (10-15%).
Patients with thrombotic ALI almost universally have some degree of pre-existing atherosclerosis, often affecting their lower extremities, leading to the development of collateral circulation. Symptoms are therefore not as dramatic as embolic ALI, which often affects patients suddenly and without established collateral circulation.
Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of embolic ALI, accounting for ⅔ of these cases. The second most common cause is a mural thrombus from the ventricle following a recent MI (approximately 20% of all embolic ALI cases).
Clinically, acute limb ischemia is classified according to the Rutherford Classification Scheme, ranging from class I (viable tissue) to class III (non-viable tissue). Table
In general, thrombotic causes are less severe in presentation, often presenting as class I or IIa, whereas embolic etiologies are more severe, presenting as class IIb or III.
Lab analysis is generally unhelpful in establishing the diagnosis; however, lab tests should be obtained to assess for renal function, hemoglobin, platelets, and coagulation profile. Add creatine kinase (CK) to assess for rhabdomyolysis.
Radiologic imaging test characteristics for the diagnosis of ALI:
Duplex arterial U/S has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 96%.
CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity of 95%.
Treatment
Treat systemic derangements accordingly (eg, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response); however, this focus should not preclude a prompt intervention for ALI when needed.
Unfractionated heparin: 80 units/kg IV bolus (max bolus dose of 10,000 units), followed by infusion at 18 units/kg/h.
Heparin initiation should be based on strong clinical suspicion rather than imaging results.
Immediate discussion with Vascular Surgery.
Speak the surgeon’s language by using terminology from the table on the Rutherford Acute Limb Ischemia Classification Scheme. Table
This discussion should clarify whether the patient goes directly to the OR vs. further imaging in the ED.
Disposition
Home
Some patients can be safely discharged with an established short-term follow-up with Vascular Surgery.
Patients with symptoms lasting >2 wk are defined as chronic and can often be discharged unless there is a superimposed severe limb infection. Close follow-up with Vascular Surgery should be arranged before the patient leaves the ED.
Some patients with ALI defined as Rutherford class I (viable) can be discharged. This course should only be followed after discussion with a vascular surgeon who can assure a prompt follow-up. Discuss anticoagulant and antiplatelet options with the vascular surgeon prior to discharge.
Admission
Most patients with ALI will be admitted.
The finding of an ABI ≤0.4 warrants initiation of heparin and immediate consultation with Vascular Surgery with admission.
Vascular surgeon vs. internist admission will largely depend on institutional practices; however, these patients will need an internist involved due to their underlying medical comorbidities.
The timing of surgery is generally guided by Rutherford classification.
I (viable): Evaluation within 24 h, will possibly need intervention.
IIa (marginally threatened): Prompt evaluation, intervention often within 24 h.
IIb (immediately threatened): Immediate evaluation and intervention by Vascular Surgery.
III (non-viable): Amputation, but usually does not need to be immediate.
Charting Pearls
Acute limb ischemia is a time-dependent disease. Skeletal muscle can tolerate 4-6 h of ischemia.  Ongoing ischemia carries a higher likelihood of irreversible damage.  Numerous factors (size of clot, location of clot, presence of collateral circulation, etc.) affect the timing of cell death.

Background
Acute limb ischemia (ALI), defined as symptoms present for <2 wk, occurs upon a sudden decrease in perfusion to tissue, leading to cell death and necrosis as the metabolic demands exceed the supply of oxygenated blood.
ALI is a vascular emergency with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of ALI is approximately 1.5 cases/10,000 persons/y. 
Amputation occurs in an estimated 10%-15% of patients during hospitalization. Due to the numerous comorbidities associated with ALI, 15%-20% of patients die within 1 year of presentation. 
In contrast, chronic limb ischemia (defined as symptoms present for >2 wk) is a sustained state of inadequate tissue perfusion. It can occur during periods of exertion (ie, claudication) or can be present at rest (ie, rest pain) and results in intractable pain or even tissue loss with ulceration or gangrene. Since it is a long-term condition, chronic limb ischemia leads to the development of collateral blood circulation, which is not established in ALI.
This absence of collateral circulation is especially true for embolic ALI, as opposed to thrombotic ALI. Given this absence of well-developed collaterals, embolic ALI tends to be much more dramatic in presentation as compared with thrombotic ALI.
Thrombotic ALI is by far the most common form of ALI, accounting for approximately 85% of observed cases.
Thrombosis is caused by the progressive narrowing of peripheral arteries that eventually results in complete occlusion. As the flow lumen gradually narrows over months to years, patients may develop symptoms of claudication, which are often evident in the patient’s history.
The most common cause of thrombosis is progression of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) due to atherosclerosis. Other causes of in-situ occlusion include acute thrombosis of a peripheral aneurysm, hypercoagulable states, dissection due to collagen disorders, or failure of a bypass graft or arterial stent. Less common causes of PAD include vasculitis, popliteal entrapment syndrome, adventitial cystic disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, or thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease).
Risk factors for atherosclerosis include, but are not limited to, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a family history of PAD. PAD is common, with an estimated prevalence of 3%-10%, increasing to 15%-20% in people >70 y old. 
A total of 5%-10% of patients with PAD and claudication will progress to rest pain or tissue loss within 5 y. This transition often occurs suddenly due to complete arterial occlusion when a platelet thrombus forms over an already stenotic lesion.
Patients with PAD may have already been treated with surgical bypass or endovascular therapies. These interventions have varying long-term patency rates, and their failure can result in ALI.
Embolic sources account for approximately 10%-15% of ALI cases. Causes of embolic ALI include:
Cardiac sources
Intracardiac thrombus: Most common, accounting for ⅔ of peripheral emboli. Usually due to atrial fibrillation but can also be caused by MI or severe, low-output CHF. Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation who are not on anticoagulation have a 3%-6% annual risk of thromboembolic complications. 
Cardiac tumor: Most commonly in the form of an atrial myxoma. These benign tumors often release fragments from the left atrium into the coronary or cerebral circulation; however, 13% of cases present with peripheral embolic symptoms. 
Endocarditis: Usually due to bacterial vegetations or debris from diseased or prosthetic valves, but can also be marantic due to lupus or other systemic disease processes. When septic, the emboli may cause a local response to infection, including abscess formation, local destruction of the artery, or infected pseudoaneurysms, in addition to ischemic symptoms.
Non-cardiac arterial sources
Aneurysm: Mural thrombus is common in aneurysms due to sluggish flow in the peripheral aneurysm sac. Embolism may be spontaneous or iatrogenic due to instrumentation.
Thrombi from aortic or iliac aneurysms most commonly embolize distally. 
Femoral aneurysms are most often mycotic or iatrogenic after vascular access; this may affect the therapeutic course by requiring antibiotics or precluding thrombolysis, respectively.
Popliteal aneurysms, while rare, present with ALI in up to 46% of cases due to progressive distal embolization that eventually leads to thrombosis of the aneurysm.  These almost universally have compromised outflow tibial and pedal arteries, and therefore have a high rate of amputation regardless of intervention. 
Aortic or iliac plaque: Also known as “shaggy aorta.” Most commonly caused by the rupture of a complex atherosclerotic plaque, which exposes a thrombogenic surface. An accumulated thrombus may embolize and occlude large vessels.  Smaller cholesterol microemboli may progress more distally in the arterial tree before becoming occlusive, presenting as blue toe syndrome. (See: Special Considerations)
Paradoxical source
In the setting of a right-to-left shunt in the heart or lungs, such as a patent foramen ovale, a DVT may embolize to either the pulmonary or arterial circulation. Due to its venous origin, this type of thrombus is generally larger. It will occasionally present with symptoms of both pulmonary embolism and ALI at the same time.  Image
Uncommon causes: See the Special Considerations section below.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of ALI is variable and influenced by numerous factors, including location, size, duration of occlusion, presence of established collateral circulation, as well as whether this finding represents underlying vascular disease.
In patients with underlying vascular disease, symptoms of acute occlusion can develop over a more prolonged period of time, such as hours to days. However, there will often be a history of acute worsening of existing symptoms. Photo
In patients with previously normal vasculature, acute occlusion often causes severe and very sudden symptoms. This acuity of presentation is due to an insufficient time for the extremity to create collateral blood flow to provide perfusion to the affected tissues. This situation is especially true of embolic, as opposed to thrombotic, ALI.
History
A careful and thorough history can help to assess a patient’s risk factors of ALI, as well as uncover predispositions for embolic and thrombotic sources. The history should identify the following:
Presence of prior symptoms of claudication.
Known history of PAD and/or arterial stent or bypass graft.
History of prior cardiac disease. Specifically, atrial fibrillation, MI, CHF, left ventricular thrombus, or endocarditis.
History of DVT, hypercoagulable states, vasculitis, or related family history.
Physical Exam
A thorough exam of the extremities is necessary to check for signs of ischemia; recall that the lower extremities are much more frequently involved than the upper extremities. The location of arterial occlusion is most often one joint above the area of malperfused tissue. Photo (Photo Photo
While not sensitive, the mnemonic known as the “6 Ps” (pain, pallor, poikilothermia, paresthesias, pulselessness, and paralysis) is a helpful guide to the clinical exam.
Pain: Often the first symptom. History should clarify the location, modifying factors, and change over time. Patients often report distal pain, and as ischemia progresses, this pain becomes more proximal and severe. Later, pain may decrease due to ischemic sensory loss.
Pallor: Often seen early; however, cyanosis develops over time.
Poikilothermia: Generally accompanies pallor.
Paresthesias: Numbness is seen in more than ½ of patients and is often the earliest neurologic manifestation of ALI. In the lower extremities, the anterior compartment of the leg is most susceptible to ischemia; accordingly, loss of sensation in the dorsal foot can be the first sign of acute vascular insufficiency. 
Pulselessness: The absence of pulses should be assessed with doppler signals, since tactile palpation is unreliable. The exam should also include ABI measurements; an ABI <0.9 is diagnostic of PAD.
Paralysis: Reflects advanced disease and is a poor prognostic sign.
The ABI is a simple, efficient, and inexpensive way to confirm clinical suspicion of PAD. In addition, it measures the severity of disease. The ABI is calculated by taking the systolic blood pressure in the ankle (measured at both the posterior tibial and dorsal pedal, and the higher value of the two is used) and dividing it by the systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery. These blood pressure measurements should be performed within the same time period.
An ABI <0.9 is suggestive of PAD; an ABI ≤0.6 is virtually diagnostic of PAD.
An ABI ≤0.4 represents an acute emergency, which mandates initiation of heparin and immediate consultation with Vascular Surgery.
Patients with an ABI >0.4 can sometimes be discharged with close follow-up with a vascular surgeon, if the patient does not have pronounced symptoms.
An exam of the extremities should assess for findings of chronic limb ischemia, such as hair loss, thin and shiny skin, thickened nails, muscle atrophy, and chronic ulcers.
Physical exam of the affected leg must be compared with the contralateral extremity. While a similar finding of the contralateral leg most often reflects a more chronic disease process, one must also be mindful of severe proximal disease (ie, aortic occlusion or dissection) causing ischemia to the bilateral lower extremities.
Radiographic Evaluation
The gold standard for assessing ALI is digital subtraction angiography performed by a vascular specialist. In addition to its high diagnostic value, angiography may also allow for advanced endovascular therapies, such as thromboembolectomy and/or catheter-directed thrombolysis. This modality may not be available in all facilities.
Although catheter-based angiography is generally preferred, other imaging modalities such as U/S, CT angiography, and MR angiography can be helpful in establishing the location and extent of occlusion. These studies can also aid in operative planning. These studies are most often performed with viable (class I) or marginally threatened (class IIa) extremities. It is often helpful to discuss imaging modalities early with Vascular Surgery, since the acquisition of further studies should not delay treatment.
Imaging modality test characteristics for ALI diagnosis:
U/S has a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 96%. 
CT angiography has shown both a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 95%. 
MR angiography has comparable or even improved sensitivity and specificity as compared with CT. 
However, this modality is rarely used in emergency situations, since it is slower, more expensive, and usually requires transport distant from the ED.
It should be noted that data regarding the diagnostic performance of these studies were obtained in patients with chronic PAD and are very limited in regard to acute limb ischemia.
Laboratory Evaluation
Lab analysis is unhelpful for the diagnosis of ALI. There are no serum markers diagnostic of ALI.
However, lab analysis is essential for monitoring co-existing conditions as well as the response to therapeutics such as anticoagulants.
The evaluation should include a complete blood count, chemistry panel, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and creatine kinase.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment of ALI involves medical, surgical, and endovascular therapies. In most cases, the approach should be multi-modal, and different techniques are often complementary.
Care is initiated by the emergency physician but turned over to vascular specialists for definitive management.
Broadly, intervention should be dually focused:
Removal of the obstruction causing the acute symptoms
Treatment of the underlying causative abnormality
The duration, location, and putative etiology of symptoms will determine whether open or endovascular therapy is pursued.
The more ischemic the limb, the faster revascularization should occur. This has traditionally been the limitation of endovascular therapies, since catheter-directed thrombolysis can require up to 72 h to restore perfusion.
Modern operating rooms may provide the opportunity to combine endovascular and open surgical techniques, taking advantage of the strengths of each.
The same factors influence the decision to perform fasciotomies for the treatment or prevention of compartment syndrome.
Medical Therapy
The mainstay of ALI treatment is IV unfractionated heparin. Unless contraindicated, heparin should be initiated early once ALI is strongly suspected, especially when the ABI is ≤0.4. Heparin should always be initiated before diagnostic imaging, unless there is diagnostic uncertainty. Unfractionated heparin is started with a bolus of 80 units/kg, followed by an infusion of 18 units/kg/h, and titrated to an activated partial thromboplastin time of 2-2.5-fold above baseline.
If the suspected cause of ALI is distal embolization due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm, heparin possibly should be withheld until that diagnosis is ruled out (discuss with a vascular surgeon).
IV heparin inhibits further clot propagation and also prevents further microvascular thrombosis of malperfused distal vessels. It is common to see symptomatic improvement with IV heparin. This improvement is thought to be due to a combination of factors including direct anticoagulation effects, anti-inflammatory properties, and volume expansion. Patients with Rutherford class I ALI Table may only require medical therapy. 
In patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a direct thrombin inhibitor is an acceptable alternative (eg, argatroban). 
Antiplatelet therapy should be initiated with aspirin. While not well-studied in ALI, aspirin is recommended for symptomatic PAD and in patients who undergo lower extremity bypass.  In addition, other acute atherosclerotic disease processes, such as MI, have shown improved outcomes with early initiation of antiplatelet therapy. It is suggested that all patients with ALI be started on aspirin in the ED.
Systemic administration of thrombolytic agents is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates and is consequently not recommended.  This is in contrast to catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolytic agents, which are an essential component of ALI treatment.
Medical therapy will also need to include analgesia and IV hydration. Patients with ALI often have concomitant volume depletion that requires prompt treatment. These patients are at further risk of acute kidney injury given the high risk of developing rhabdomyolysis due to both the initial muscular ischemia and reperfusion injury following appropriate therapy. Although the existence of contrast-induced nephropathy is the subject of current investigation, one must also be aware that these patients tend to receive numerous doses of iodinated contrast media.
Endovascular Therapy
Guidelines from most major societies recommend a trial of catheter-directed thrombolysis only in patients with a viable or marginally threatened limb (Rutherford class I-IIa) and no contraindications to thrombolytic agents.  Image
A recent Cochrane review of five RCTs comparing open surgery with catheter-directed thrombolysis in ALI noted no significant differences in limb salvage, amputation, or death. Catheter-directed thrombolysis showed a trend toward a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications and distal embolization. There was no difference in stroke between the groups; however, the evidence was of low quality. 
Other situations in which catheter-directed thrombolysis may be preferred:
Thrombosis of an occluded stent or bypass graft, especially in patients who have received multiple vascular interventions.
Patients with significant comorbidities who may not tolerate a general anesthetic (with the exception of embolectomy under local).
Patients with a distal thrombus in the tibial or pedal arteries that is difficult to remove with surgical embolectomy.
Catheter-directed thrombolysis may be absolutely contraindicated in certain circumstances Table and the following are additional situations that may require extra consideration:
Avoid thrombolysis in patients with suspicion of bypass graft infection, since systemic circulation of the infected thrombus could theoretically cause remote seeding.
An atherosclerotic plaque, tumor emboli, or chronic thrombus that has embolized (ie, mural thrombus from an aneurysm) will likely not respond as well to thrombolysis.
Recommendations limit catheter-directed thrombolysis to marginally ischemic patients almost exclusively due to the time required for thrombus resolution with thrombolytics alone. Traditional techniques require placement of an infusion catheter across the occluded segment with continuous infusion of tPA [Alteplase (R)] 0.12-2 mg/h and serial angiography to assess progress every 6-24 h up to 72 h. New endovascular technologies are decreasing the time requirement but these have not been evaluated in large trials. It is unclear whether new techniques will result in improved outcomes as compared with catheter-directed thrombolysis in more severely ischemic limbs.
Catheter-directed thrombolysis carries a relatively low rate of complications; however, the complication risk is directly related to the duration of therapy required.
Risk of any complication is 4% at 8 h, with a significant increase to 34% at 40 h.
Major hemorrhage occurs in 6%-9% of patients, and intracranial hemorrhage occurs in up to 2.8%. 
In some cases, surgery may still be required. However, studies suggest that the intervention is less extensive than would have been indicated prior to catheter-directed thrombolysis.  There is a trend toward improved amputation-free survival in these cases.
Surgical Therapy
Operative intervention is indicated for immediately threatened limbs (IIb) or in patients with contraindications to lysis. The technique is determined by the location and etiology of the occlusion.
Other situations in which open surgery may be preferred:
Clearly embolic ALI with adequate outflow and an accessible thrombus, even with a viable or marginally threatened limb, may be treated quickly with common femoral or popliteal cut-down for emboli in the iliac, femoral, or popliteal arteries. This approach can often be performed under local anesthetic and may therefore be a viable option even in systemically ill patients.
Non-viable limbs should be taken for amputation. While not urgent, progressive ischemia may lead to systemic derangements that worsen the patient’s condition.
A Rutherford class III ALI may undergo revascularization solely for enhanced perfusion to facilitate a more distal amputation than otherwise possible (ie, below- vs. above-knee amputation).
Options include thromboembolectomy with balloon catheters or arterial bypass with adjunctive endarterectomy or intraoperative thrombolysis.
Most commonly, an accessible segment of the artery is exposed (brachial artery, common femoral artery, popliteal artery) and a balloon catheter is passed proximally and distally. Thrombus in the aorta may be retrieved from the bilateral femoral arteries. If there is not a satisfactory return of flow, intraoperative arteriography should be pursued and culprit lesions treated as necessary. Image
Care After Intervention
Much of the immediate aftercare of these patients will be outside the scope of traditional emergency medicine management; however, it is worth briefly discussing some key areas:
Reperfusion injury: As muscle is reperfused, products of muscle breakdown such as potassium, myoglobin and reactive oxygen species are released into the circulation, manifesting as rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and renal failure.
Compartment syndrome: Reperfusion of previously ischemic muscle produces edema, leading to increased pressure within extremity compartments. Compartment syndrome is more commonly seen in patients who have undergone open revascularization as compared with catheter-directed treatment, the latter of which induces a more gradual resolution of ischemia.
For patients in whom an embolic etiology is suspected, the source must be investigated. Standard progression is an echogram followed by CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to search for an aneurysm or atherosclerotic plaques. Usually, this will be performed second, following treatment for ALI. Occasionally, this may be undertaken with initial diagnostic imaging. For example, if blue toe syndrome is suspected and a CT angiogram is ordered for confirmation, a study including the chest along with the abdomen and pelvis can be used to rule out non-cardiac intra-arterial sources.
Prevention and Long-Term Management
Following vascular intervention, most patients are managed with chronic anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. Anticoagulant choice is dependent on the etiology of limb ischemia. For example, a patient with embolic ALI from atrial fibrillation may ultimately be anticoagulated with warfarin or rivaroxaban, while a patient with thrombotic ALI due to atherosclerosis will be treated with long-term aspirin or clopidogrel.
Special Considerations
Thromboangiitis Obliterans: Also known as Buerger’s disease. This is a chronic, inflammatory, thrombotic vasculopathy affecting small- and medium-sized arteries. Imaging classically demonstrates segmental arterial occlusions and corkscrewing collaterals. This disease has multi-organ involvement, and one of its manifestations is ischemic ulcerations of the digits. First-line treatment is smoking cessation.
Takayasu’s Disease: This autoimmune vasculitis affects large arteries, including the aorta and its major branches. In comparison with other forms of vasculitis, some clinical manifestations of Takayasu’s disease are more amenable to surgical treatment.  Image
Phlegmasia: This is due to a massive iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis, which leads to severe edema with resulting compression of the arterial system, and consequently, ischemia. Medical treatment includes anticoagulation, and there is also a role for surgical intervention with thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis. 
Trauma: Arterial injury from both penetrating and blunt trauma can lead to limb ischemia, and is most often treated surgically. One should be mindful of specific injuries, such as posterior knee dislocations, which have a high likelihood of vascular injury. Emergency physicians should also be mindful of iatrogenic trauma following vascular procedures, since these can lead to ALI from both thrombotic and embolic mechanisms. Image
Vasospasm: Primary Raynaud’s disease affects the distal extremities, is self-limiting, and does not generally cause acute ischemia. Secondary Raynaud’s, which is due to connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma, can cause digit ischemia. This is most often treated medically with vasodilators or prostanoids. Other causes of vasospasm include ergotism and inadvertent iatrogenic or illicit drug injection into the arterial system. Photo
Proximal/systemic sources: While often difficult to diagnose, a careful history and physical exam can suggest a more proximal cause of limb ischemia, such as endocarditis causing septic emboli or aortic dissection. Acute limb ischemia caused by an aortic dissection suggests an extensive dissection and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates.  Image
Blue toe syndrome: This presents with cool and cyanotic toes, often with scattered petechiae. In contrast, the more proximal foot is surprisingly well-perfused, with normal color, temperature, and pulses. These small vessel occlusions are due to atherothrombotic emboli from more proximal sources and tend to be very painful. This is distinct from toe gangrene due to chronic limb ischemia. Bilateral physical exam findings suggest a source proximal to the aortic bifurcation. Occasionally, symptoms can present in the upper extremities, which indicates a source in the aortic arch branches. Treatment is generally medical, and patients will require work-up to investigate the source of the microemboli.
Upper extremity ischemia: Limb ischemia of the upper extremities is much more rare. As opposed to the lower extremities, upper limb ischemia is more often embolic in nature, since atherosclerosis of the upper extremities is unusual. The arm has an inherently more robust collateral circulation; accordingly, upper limb ischemia less often threatens tissue viability.  Image",Peripheral Arterial Disease

Approach to the Critical Patient
General approach:
Stabilization and diagnostic investigation should occur simultaneously.
Perform tracheal intubation (if needed and not already completed) to ensure airway patency and adequate gas exchange.
Place central venous and arterial catheters to initiate invasive hemodynamic monitoring.
If adequate peripheral IVs are in place, then central venous access may not be required.
If hemodynamic status is stable, then arterial line may not be needed.
Treat shock and ensure adequate oxygen delivery.
Minimize secondary brain injury.
If not already identified, search for the underlying etiology of cardiac arrest.
Cardiovascular:
Obtain 12-lead ECG to screen for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or other significant acute coronary event.
STEMI patients should receive prompt coronary angiography with revascularization, as indicated.

Cisatracurium: Load 0.1-0.2 mg/kg, then infuse 1 to 3 μg/kg/min.
Neuromuscular blockade necessitates EEG monitoring.
Avoid benzodiazepines, given their propensity to accumulate (especially with lower body temperature) and obfuscate the neurologic exam.
Respiratory:
Target normoxia (SaO2 94%-98%); avoid hyperoxia (SaO2 100% with supplemental oxygen administration).
Target eucapnia (PaCO2 35-40 mm Hg).
Temporarily correct severe acidemia, which adversely impacts hemodynamics, by increasing the minute ventilation or judiciously administering serum buffers.
Metabolic:
Measure serial serum lactate values to ensure clearance.
Impaired or absent lactate clearance requires investigation for additional tissue source with ongoing shock (ie, mesenteric ischemia, sepsis).
Support acute kidney injury with adequate restoration of circulation and oxygen delivery.
Use renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis, if indicated.
Support ischemic hepatitis (“shock liver”) with adequate restoration of circulation and oxygen delivery.
Infectious:
Treat underlying infections suspected as the etiology of cardiac arrest (ie, septic shock with cardiovascular collapse).
Use institutional ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention bundle (ie, elevate the head of the bed by approximately 30°; institute proper oral hygiene).
Maintain vigilance for aspiration or VAP.
Treat suspected bacteremia.

Review of treatment of post arrest hypotension Part 1 EM:RAP Audio Part 2 EM:RAP Audio
Post-cardiac arrest care is a complex, multidisciplinary endeavor that requires careful attention to multiple organ systems.
The overarching goals are two-fold: to support bodily functions and to determine the cause of arrest and treat accordingly.
A more detailed description includes the following:
To correct physiologic derangements,
To support myocardial dysfunction
To minimize secondary brain injury
To accurately estimate neurologic prognosis (at the appropriate time)
The post-cardiac arrest syndrome is characterized by:
Hypoxic brain injury
Myocardial dysfunction
Systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury and
The underlying etiology of cardiac arrest
Patients will manifest different combinations and severities of these four domains of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome. Management should be tailored to the specific combination and severity for each patient.
Patients should ideally be treated at a regional cardiac receiving center with the complete spectrum of multidisciplinary services available for these complex patients.
Key Diagnostic Elements
History
Elicit the typical history from the family, emergency medical services (EMS), or the medical record.
Comorbidities, medication list, medication allergies, advanced directives and “do not resuscitate” status.
What were the pre-clinical circumstances leading up to cardiac arrest?
Was the collapse witnessed?
Was bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed?
What was the initial cardiac rhythm?
Did bystander care occur? CPR? Automated external defibrillator (AED)?
What was the duration of “no-flow” (interval from collapse to the onset of CPR)?
What was the duration of “low-flow” (interval from onset of CPR to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC])?
How many defibrillation attempts?
How many doses of epinephrine (or other vasopressor)?
Any other issues or observations from the EMS crew.
Physical Examination
Perform a more in-depth examination after the primary survey (airway, breathing, circulation; ABCs) has been completed.
General:
Assess for evidence of trauma or environmental injury.
Neurologic:
Most patients will be comatose immediately after ROSC.
Specifically, assess and document brainstem reflexes (pupillary, corneal, gag/cough, spontaneous respirations) and motor exam.
Localizing or focal neurological findings are unexpected and suggest an intracranial process.
Evaluate for rhythmic or periodic body/facial movements indicative of seizure.
Hemodynamic:
Assess for signs of shock (eg, skin color and warmth, capillary refill, urinary output, inferior vena cava diameter/collapse).
Auscultate for obvious heart murmurs that require further investigation or management.
Respiratory:
Verify appropriate endotracheal tube placement, if present.
Assess for signs of airspace disease and treat accordingly.
Assess for bronchospasm and treat accordingly.
Metabolic:
Assess hourly urinary output using an indwelling urinary catheter to guide resuscitative fluid status.
Gastrointestinal:
Assess for gastrointestinal bleeding if suspected as the etiology of cardiac arrest.
Assess for abdominal distension or palpable mass.
Other systems as appropriate (eg, GU, GYN, Skin)
Testing
Laboratory
Routinely obtain a CBC, CMP, glucose, coagulation profile, and UA.
Lactate
Troponin
Arterial blood gas
Type and screen
12-lead ECG
Assess for STEMI and other significant findings suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or the cause of the cardiac arrest.
Consider serial ECGs to detect evolving ACS.
Imaging
Focused bedside U/S:
RUSH (rapid ultrasound for shock and hypotension)/shock exam (pericardial effusion, ejection fraction, right ventricular dilation, inferior vena cava diameter/collapse, aorta assessment, deep vein thrombosis evaluation).
Bedside cardiac U/S to screen for depressed ejection fraction, right ventricular dilation, pericardial effusion, severe valvular disease, regional wall motion abnormality.
Evaluate for hemo- or pneumothorax.
CXR:
Confirm endotracheal tube placement.
Use CXR to screen for cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary edema, airspace disease, pneumothorax, trauma, and iatrogenic injuries from CPR.
Head CT:
Screen for intracranial pathologies in patients with a history concerning for a central nervous system process:
Focal neurologic deficit
Pre-arrest neurologic complaints
Head trauma
Anticoagulation
Assess for early evidence of anoxic brain injury.
CT angiogram of thorax:
As guided by clinical suspicion for the underlying etiology of cardiac arrest.
Evaluate for pulmonary embolism, aortic pathology, airspace disease, trauma, and iatrogenic injuries from CPR.
Abdomen/pelvis CT:
As guided by clinical suspicion for the underlying etiology of cardiac arrest, impaired or absent lactate clearance, and/or iatrogenic injuries from CPR.
Treatment
Treat Shock
Place a central venous catheter.
Peripheral venous catheters are likely adequate in many situations.
Place an arterial catheter if hemodynamically unstable and vasoactive infusion(s) are in place.
Maintain a MAP as follows:
65 mm Hg if ACS/STEMI
Approximately 80 mm Hg if non-ACS
Intravascular volume expansion as required.
Give norepinephrine 0.1 to 0.5 μg/kg/min:
PRN: Dobutamine 5 to 10 μg/kg/min
PRN: Epinephrine 0.1 to 0.5 μg/kg/min
Check serial serum lactate levels for clearance.
Ensure Adequate Gas Exchange
Titrate FiO2 to goal SaO2 94%-98%; avoid hyperoxia (SaO2 100% with supplemental oxygen administration).
Titrate ventilation to goal PaCO2 35-40 mm Hg.
Correct Acid-Base Disturbances
Mechanical ventilation
Optimize systemic perfusion
Use serum buffers (ie, sodium bicarbonate infusions) only for severe acidemia that is adversely impacting hemodynamics.
Regulate Body Temperature
Initiate active measures to achieve a goal body temperature 32-36°C.
Place a continuous temperature monitoring probe (eg, esophageal, Foley).
Propofol 5-50 μg/kg/min
PRN shivering: Fentanyl 0.7 to 10 μg/kg/h
PRN shivering: Dexmedetomidine 0.2 to 0.7 μg/kg/h
PRN shivering: Cisatracurium 1 to 3 μg/kg/min
Assess for Acute Myocardial Ischemia
Obtain a 12-lead ECG. Serial ECGs are recommended to identify evolving ischemia, if clinically suspected.
Bedside echocardiogram can assist in evaluation.
Screen for Seizures
EEG if clinically suspected and available.
Titrate propofol up to 50 μg/kg/min as hemodynamics allow
PRN: Lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg IV bolus
PRN: Levetiracetam 1,000 mg IV
PRN: Fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg IV loading dose PRN
PRN: Valproic acid 20 mg/kg IV loading dose PRN

Background
Epidemiology
Post-cardiac arrest patients represent a heterogeneous mix of pathology and illness severity. 
Patients with cardiac arrest lasting more than a few minutes are typically comatose at hospital admission. A small subset will awaken rapidly, but the majority of patients will not wake until many hours to many days have elapsed. This period is prolonged by sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and lower body temperature. 
Post-cardiac arrest patients are at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Among the successfully resuscitated patients admitted to the ICU after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), approximately one-third survive to hospital discharge.
Shock and cardiovascular disease contribute to the majority of early deaths after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest, but only to ~33% of total deaths from cardiac arrest.
Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy due to perceived poor neurologic prognosis accounts for two-thirds of all subsequent deaths after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 
Pathophysiology
Post-cardiac arrest syndrome is characterized by
Hypoxic brain injury
Myocardial dysfunction
Systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury and
The underlying etiology of cardiac arrest
Patients will manifest different combinations and severities of these four domains. Management should be tailored to the specific combination and severity for each patient.  
Brain injury
Brain injury results from the limited tolerance of the brain to ischemia and its response to reperfusion.
Multiple complex mechanisms of brain injury are triggered by cardiac arrest, all of which lead to the activation of cell death signaling pathways. This pathway can activate between hours to days after ROSC.
The most vulnerable portions of the brain to global ischemia from cardiac arrest are the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, corpus striatum, and thalamus.
The cerebrovasculature undergoes a brief period of global “no-reflow,” in which microcirculatory intravascular thrombosis inhibits the restoration of microvascular perfusion to the underlying parenchyma despite the restoration of macrocirculation with associated macroscopic hyperemia.
After initial reperfusion, secondary brain injury is caused by impaired oxygen delivery due to hypotension, hypoxemia, impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, cerebral edema, pyrexia, hyperglycemia, and seizure.
Clinically, brain injury is characterized by impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, cerebral edema, and post-ischemic neurodegeneration. Brain injury manifests as coma, seizure, neurocognitive impairment ranging from mild cognitive dysfunction to persistent vegetative state and brain death.
Myocardial dysfunction:
Ranges from mild to severe but is typically responsive to therapy and transient.
The typical time to recovery is 24-72 h.
Hemodynamics are usually labile immediately after ROSC due to residual circulating endogenous and exogenous catecholamines.
Myocardial dysfunction is characterized by a reduction in the ejection fraction, an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and low cardiac output. In the absence of territorial myocardial ischemia, the coronary blood flow is typically normal.
Global myocardial stunning may be compounded by regional ischemia from ACS, with an associated potential for cardiogenic shock or dysrhythmia.
Systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury:
Occurs after the complete cessation of oxygen delivery and removal of metabolites during cardiac arrest, which is only partially attenuated by CPR.
The combination of impaired oxygen delivery and compensatory increase in tissue oxygen extraction during CPR leads to a reduction in central venous oxygen saturation. After ROSC, the accumulated oxygen debt causes endothelial injury and systemic inflammation, activating immune and coagulation pathways that are similar to the pathophysiology of sepsis.
Relative adrenal insufficiency is common.
Clinically, systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury manifests as intravascular volume depletion, vasoplegia, impaired oxygen delivery and utilization, immunosuppression, and multiple organ failure.
Diagnostic Considerations
The diagnostic work-up of post-cardiac arrest patients focuses not only on establishing the etiology of cardiac arrest but also on assessing the severity of brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, and systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Clinical Presentation
Elicit specific details regarding the pre-clinical circumstances of cardiac arrest including the setting, events, and recent healthcare encounters.
Elicit specific details regarding the prehospital resuscitation, including whether the collapse was witnessed, whether bystander CPR was performed, the initial cardiac rhythm, the interval from collapse to the onset of CPR, the interval from CPR to ROSC, and specific prehospital interventions.
These historical elements tend to propagate in the patient’s chart based on the emergency physician’s note and influence subsequent inpatient care.
Review the medical record to establish comorbidities, medications, and advance directives.
Physical Examination
The bedside examination should focus on searching for hints as to the etiology of cardiac arrest, assessing shock severity, and estimating the initial severity of coma.
Be especially vigilant for indwelling medical devices or evidence of a recent healthcare encounter.
Examine standard indicators of shock (eg, skin temperature, capillary refill, urine output).
Coma is not a binary clinical status, and the neurologic exam is often dynamic over the initial hours after ROSC as cerebral perfusion is restored and acid-base abnormalities are corrected. Post-cardiac arrest patients present along a spectrum of coma ranging from vigorous withdrawal or localization to noxious stimuli to the complete absence of brainstem reflexes. 
Augment the physical examination with bedside point-of-care testing (ie, ECG, focused bedside U/S).
Radiographic Evaluation
A chest radiograph is typically obtained to confirm endotracheal tube placement for obvious cardiopulmonary or intra-thoracic pathology.
Obtain an initial head CT to screen for intracranial hemorrhage as the etiology of cardiac arrest. This approach also provides useful prognostic information (ratio of Hounsfield units in gray matter and white matter) to combine with the clinical neurologic examination and establish initial estimates of neurologic recovery that are subsequently revised with additional testing. 
Additional CT imaging (eg, CT angio thorax, CT abdomen/pelvis) may be used to screen for the etiologies of cardiac arrest. These imaging orders are typically driven by clinical suspicion or elements of the pre-clinical history.
Some clinicians advocate for whole-body CT imaging after cardiac arrest to comprehensively screen for pathology and define iatrogenic injuries from CPR. 
Thoracic skeletal fractures are the most common iatrogenic injury after CPR, including rib fractures (70%-85%) and sternal fractures (8%-30%).
A smaller percentage of patients experiences mediastinal injuries, pneumothorax, or hemothorax. 
Post-cardiac arrest patients occasionally exhibit solid organ abdominal injuries. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Obtain a comprehensive panel of laboratory studies similar to that in other critically ill patients (ie, CBC, CMP, coagulation profile, UA, serum lactate, troponin, arterial blood gas, type and screen).
Lactic acidemia is common after ROSC. However, impaired or absent lactate clearance should prompt the re-evaluation of oxygen delivery and investigation for additional tissue sources of ongoing shock (ie, mesenteric ischemia).
Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidemia is typical after ROSC. An isolated source of acidemia or the presence of alkalemia should prompt further investigation into the etiology of cardiac arrest.
Reactive leukocytosis is common after ROSC and does not automatically indicate an infectious etiology of cardiac arrest. However, post-cardiac arrest patients are also at a higher risk for pneumonia and bacteremia.
Therapeutic Considerations
The post-cardiac arrest syndrome manifests as hypoxic brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, and systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury, in addition to the underlying etiology of cardiac arrest.
Patients suffer from different combinations and severities of these injuries, and therapy should be tailored to each patient. The overarching therapeutic goals are to correct physiologic derangements, restore normal organ function, and minimize secondary brain injury.
Cardiovascular Considerations
Unless the patient is awake and following commands with a native airway, the clinician should place central venous and arterial catheters early after ROSC in preparation for vasopressor infusion. Post-cardiac arrest patients often hemodynamically deteriorate 30-60 min after ROSC.
Myocardial stunning, impaired cardiac output, and vasoplegia are common but often transient (hours to days). Even after sufficient volume replacement with isotonic fluids, most patients initially require continuous vasopressors and/or inotropes.
Vasopressors:
Norepinephrine is a reasonable first choice vasopressor in the post-cardiac arrest setting.
Additional or alternative agents (eg, dobutamine, epinephrine) may be required for inotropic support depending on the degree of myocardial stunning.
Escalate myocardial support in a graded fashion to match the degree of cardiogenic shock. Some patients require temporary mechanical circulatory support (ie, intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device, veno-arterial ECMO). 
Acute Coronary Syndrome:
ACS is a common etiology of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
The 12-lead ECG is a screening tool for the detection of ACS.
Coronary lesions amenable to emergency treatment are found in 70%-85% of patients with ST segment elevation, and as many as 25%-50% of patients without ST segment elevation.  (AHA ECC Guidelines Part 8: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; AHA ECC Guidelines Part 9: Acute Coronary Syndromes; Guidelines for Resuscitation Section 5: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; ILCOR CoSTR).
Numerous observational studies demonstrate the association between invasive coronary angiography with revascularization, survival, and neurologic recovery in post-cardiac arrest patients with ST elevation. A few observational studies demonstrate the same associations in post-cardiac arrest patients without ST elevation. All of these studies are hindered by at least some degree of selection bias. Several prospective randomized trials are currently underway  (AHA ECC Guidelines Part 8: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; AHA ECC Guidelines Part 9: Acute Coronary Syndromes; ERC Guidelines for Resuscitation Section 5: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; ILCOR CoSTR).
STEMI:
Although there are minor variations in the phrasing of recommendations from international consensus guidelines, post-cardiac arrest patients with ST elevation should typically receive emergency invasive coronary angiography regardless of whether the patient is comatose or awake.
Patients without STEMI but suspected of ACS:
Patients with potential “STEMI-equivalents” (eg, an initial shockable cardiac rhythm or ongoing hemodynamic/electrical instability) are at higher risk for coronary lesions amenable to emergency treatment and are more likely to benefit from the definition of coronary artery anatomy, revascularization, or percutaneous mechanical circulatory support. Discuss these cases with Interventional Cardiology (AHA ECC Guidelines Part 8: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; AHA ECC Guidelines Part 9: Acute Coronary Syndromes; ERC Guidelines for Resuscitation Section 5: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; ILCOR CoSTR).
Risk-stratification for invasive coronary angiography:
There is mounting interest within the cardiology community to risk-stratify comatose post-cardiac arrest patients with respect to death from neurologic injury when selecting patients for invasive coronary angiography.
One such framework was recently proposed in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.  It is helpful for the ED clinician to be familiar with this algorithm and the ‘‘unfavorable resuscitation features” to facilitate discussion with the interventional cardiologist.
Timing of invasive coronary angiography:
Even in the absence of STEMI, patients with an initially shockable rhythm or ongoing hemodynamic/electrical instability are at higher risk for unstable coronary lesions and are more likely to benefit from access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
The COACT trial provides the only available randomized data on post-cardiac arrest invasive coronary angiography. A total of 552 subjects with OHCA and an initially shockable rhythm were randomized to immediate coronary angiography or coronary angiography delayed until after neurologic recovery. Subjects with shock were excluded. The study concluded that there were no statistical differences in survival or neurologic recovery at 90 d. 
Patients with ongoing hemodynamic/electrical instability likely require more urgent cardiac catheterization, whereas the stable patient without ongoing shock may tolerate a delay of cardiac catheterization until signs of neurologic recovery.
Eight additional randomized trials comparing immediate and delayed invasive coronary angiography are currently in process. 
Neurologic Considerations
Minimize secondary brain injury by ensuring adequate cardiac output and oxygen delivery and avoiding hyperoxia.
Titrate FiO2 to goal SaO2 94%-98%.
Cerebrovascular autoregulation is commonly upregulated or impaired in post-ROSC patients, and a higher MAP is sometimes required to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion.
Conversely, cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity is typically preserved in post-ROSC patients, so titrate the ventilation to goal PaCO2 35-40 mm Hg.
Seizure:
An initial EEG is useful to screen for subclinical seizures and to distinguish shivering from myoclonic jerking.
Patients who have received neuromuscular blockade should also have continuous EEG monitoring.
Treat clinical or electroencephalographic seizures with a bolus of benzodiazepines, upward titration of propofol (if already infusing), and anti-epileptic medications (AHA ECC Guidelines Part 8: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; ERC Guidelines for Resuscitation Section 5: Post Cardiac Arrest Care).
Benzodiazepines delay the timing of neuroprognostication in patients receiving targeted temperature management (TTM) or with ischemic hepatitis due to delayed metabolism.
Temperature regulation:
Reduce cerebral metabolic demand by targeting a body temperature of 32-36°C and meticulously avoid hyperthermia (≥38°C).
The failure to control body temperature is associated with hyperthermia and worse neurologic outcome.
The terminology “therapeutic hypothermia” has been largely replaced with “targeted temperature management” (TTM).
Post-cardiac arrest patients treated with temperature management have lower odds of mortality and higher odds of good neurologic outcome.
Choice of target temperature:
When combined with a standardized post-cardiac care bundle, lowering the core body temperature to 32-34°C improves neurologic outcome compared with not controlling the patient’s body temperature. 
However, when body temperature is controlled, there is not a clear difference in neurologic outcome when the temperature is maintained at either 33°C or 36°C. 
Within this range, a lower body temperature may prolong the metabolic clearance of sedation and neuromuscular blockade, but a higher body temperature allows for the possibility of “temperature creep” into the hyperthermic range with associated deleterious effects.  (AHA ECC Guidelines Part 8: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; ERC Guidelines for Resuscitation Section 5: Post Cardiac Arrest Care).
Regardless of the temperature target selected, initiate TTM as soon as possible after ROSC.
There are no contraindications to targeting normothermia (ie, 36°C). Relative contraindications to targeting hypothermia (ie, 33°C) include hemodynamic instability, known coagulopathy, and uncontrolled sources of bleeding.
Sedation:
Sedative infusions must be carefully considered.
The brief half-life of propofol is desirable but may adversely impact hemodynamics.
Benzodiazepine infusions tend to accumulate and cloud the neurologic examination, especially with lower body temperature or hepatic/renal dysfunction.
If hemodynamically tolerated, propofol is a reasonable first choice. 
Alternatively, fentanyl or dexmedetomidine may be considered because both are short-acting and should enable more reliable neurologic assessments compared with benzodiazepines when assessing for early awakening. 
Neuro-prognostication
Avoid the pitfall of premature neurological prognostication.
In the absence of clear advance directives, underlying terminal disease, or formal brain death, the earliest time to prognosticate a poor neurologic outcome using clinical examination in patients not treated with TTM is 72 h after ROSC.
The earliest time to prognosticate a poor neurologic outcome using clinical examination in patients treated with TTM, where sedation or neuromuscular blockade could confound the exam, may be up to 72 h after return to normothermia.
Neurology consultation will be required for EEG monitoring and the interpretation of somatosensory evoked potentials.
Neurologic prognostication should occur in a Bayesian fashion  with a baseline estimate of recovery (informed by case features, initial bedside neurological examination, and initial head CT) that is successively revised by the addition of new data from serial clinical neurological examinations, EEG findings, evoked potentials, brain imaging, and serum biomarkers of brain injury (AHA ECC Guidelines Part 8: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; ERC Guidelines for Resuscitation Section 5: Post Cardiac Arrest Care).
The European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine have developed a visual algorithm to guide clinicians through a clear, step-wise approach to neurologic prognostication. Algorithm
Respiratory Considerations
Most patients display a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidemia. This type of acidemia is typically corrected with mechanical ventilation and adequate treatment of shock. Temporarily correct severe acidemia that is adversely affecting hemodynamics by increasing minute ventilation or judiciously administering serum buffers.
Target normocarbia (PaCO2 35-40 mm Hg) to avoid hypocapnia-induced cerebral vasoconstriction.
In observational studies, normocarbia was associated with better clinical outcomes compared with higher or lower PaCO2  
Target oxygen saturation 94%-98%. Both hypoxia and prolonged hyperoxia (PaO2 >300 mm Hg) are associated with worse clinical outcomes (AHA ECC Guidelines Part 8: Post Cardiac Arrest Care; ERC Guidelines for Resuscitation Section 5: Post Cardiac Arrest Care).
Metabolic Considerations
Most patients display a mixed respiratory/metabolic acidemia.
Measure serial serum lactate values to ensure clearance. Impaired or absent lactate clearance should prompt the re-evaluation of oxygen delivery and identification of residual tissue sources with ongoing shock (eg, mesenteric ischemia).
Support acute kidney injury with the adequate restoration of circulation and oxygen delivery. Use renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis if indicated.
Support ischemic hepatitis (“shock liver”) with the adequate restoration of circulation and oxygen delivery.
There is no demonstrated additional benefit of tight serum glucose control compared with more liberal management after cardiac arrest. A goal serum glucose range between 140-180 mg/dL is reasonable.  Lower target ranges are associated with hypoglycemia. 
Infectious Considerations
Treat any infections suspected as the etiology of cardiac arrest (ie, septic shock with multisystem organ failure and cardiovascular collapse).
Post-cardiac arrest patients are at higher risk of pneumonia (aspiration or ventilator associated). 
Use institutional ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention bundle (ie, elevate the head of the bed by approximately 30°; institute proper oral hygiene).
Post-cardiac arrest patients are at higher risk of bacteremia from the translocation of bacteria across intestinal mucosa during the cardiac arrest period.
TTM may mask a febrile response.
Treat bacteremia when clinically suspected.
The value of prophylactic antibiotics is not clear, and must be weighed against cost and adverse effects (allergy, GI effects, Clostridium difficile infection, and development of antibiotic resistance).
A 2019 systematic review of primarily OHCA subjects found low or very low quality evidence from mostly observational studies suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis is not associated with improvements in clinical outcomes or a reduction in pneumonia incidence.  Subsequent investigations with high-quality controlled trials could revise this finding.
Two narrative reviews with best practice protocols for antibiotic administration following cardiac arrest recommend that only patients with positive respiratory microbiology or objective evidence of aspiration should be treated with antimicrobials. 
Disposition
All post-cardiac arrest subjects, even those who are awake with a native airway, should be admitted to the ICU. If available, the precise subspecialty ICU should be determined based on the underlying pathology and type of critical illness.
Given the complex nature of post-cardiac arrest patients, regionalized receiving hospitals with the complete spectrum of multidisciplinary services have been proposed, similar to existing regionalized systems of care for trauma, STEMI, and stroke. In a recent meta-analysis of observational studies, patients cared for at a self-designated cardiac arrest center had higher odds of survival with favorable neurologic outcomes than patients cared for at hospitals without a designation. When feasible, post-cardiac arrest patients should be transferred to a suitable tertiary care center. 
Special Designation
Documentation
Be meticulous and precise about documenting the pre-clinical features leading up to cardiac arrest, as well as the salient historical questions noted above (eg, witnesses, bystander CPR, no-flow interval, low-flow interval, number of defibrillation attempts, number of epinephrine doses). These data tend to be propagated in the medical record, and it is easy to introduce factual discrepancies into these historical elements.",Post-Arrest Care
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can quickly become right heart failure with any changes in clinical status.
Hypotension, hypoxemia, or hypercapnia can provoke or exacerbate right ventricle (RV) failure.
Once PH is recognized, early consultation with a PH specialist is mandatory.
If the patient does not have a PH physician, consider consultation with a pulmonologist, cardiologist, or intensivist.
Patients with acute RV failure should be transferred to an ICU for early pulmonary artery (PA) line placement.
Unless there is clear evidence of volume depletion, IV fluid boluses should be avoided.
If fluids are indicated, use 250-mL aliquots and reassess.
Blood pressure should be supported with vasopressor infusions to prevent RV ischemia.
Norepinephrine initial dose 7-35 µg/min is first-line, rapidly titrate as needed and initial doses may need to be higher.
Vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min is second-line, or in patients with tachycardia.
Inotropes can be initiated for persistent hypoperfusion once the blood pressure is supported.
Dobutamine initial dose 2.5 µg/kg/min is first line, rapidly titrate as needed and initial doses may need to be higher.
Epinephrine 2-10 µg/min to be titrated as needed. Epinephrine is second-line.
Hypoxemia and hypercapnia should be corrected through non-invasive means, including a high-flow nasal cannula.
Intubation should be avoided if at all possible.
If intubation cannot be avoided, hypotension during and after the procedure must be prevented.
Hang a norepinephrine drip prior to intubation and initiate immediately if hypotension develops during or after intubation.
Key Concepts
EM:RAP 2016 audio review EM:RAP Audio
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is elevated pressure in the pulmonary vascular system, defined as a mean pressure >25 mm Hg by pulmonary artery (PA) catheterization.
Echocardiography is only a screening test, but any patient with elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) or right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) should be suspected of PH.
Bedside U/S is critical to evaluate evidence of elevated right ventricular (RV) pressure.
PH can lead to RV failure, and RV failure can be very difficult to correct once deterioration begins.
Volume status is difficult to appreciate, but patients with PH are more likely to be volume overloaded than depleted.
Standard resuscitative techniques, including large volume fluid administration and intubation, may be detrimental in PH.
Early consultation with a PH expert is essential in any unstable patient.
PH patients may be on a chronic infusion of a pulmonary vasodilator.
Malfunction of these pumps is an emergency requiring prompt restoration of medication to prevent rebound PH and cardiopulmonary collapse.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Approximately 1% of patients in the ED have PH.
Early in PH, the physical exam is often normal.
With progressive RV dysfunction, patients will demonstrate signs of volume and pressure overload, including elevated jugular venous pressure, abdominal distention, hepatomegaly, and pedal edema.
Tricuspid regurgitation leads to a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
In isolated PH with RV failure (but without LV involvement), the lungs will be clear to auscultation without evidence of pulmonary congestion.
If available, review prior echocardiogram data for:
Dilation and systolic function of the RV
RV hypertrophy
RVSP or PASP values >35 mm Hg
Tricuspid annular systolic excursion (TAPSE) <1 cm
Tricuspid regurgitation
Bedside U/S
“D sign” on parasternal short
Dilated RV on apical 4-chamber view
ECG and chest X-ray are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific.
Treatment
The most important aspect of treating PH in the ED is recognition.
Do not make stable PH patients unstable by administering large doses of opioids, benzodiazepines, or performing procedural sedation.
Consult a PH specialist for all unstable patients.
Address preload.
Do not give fluids if there is evidence of volume overload.
If fluids must be administered, give 250 mL over 30-60 min and reassess.
May benefit from diuresis.
Optimize contractility.
Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg to prevent RV ischemia.
Initiate vasopressor infusions early.
Norepinephrine 7-35 µg/min is first-line, rapidly titrate as needed and initial doses may need to be higher.
Vasopressin 0.03-0.04 units/min is second-line, or in patients with tachycardia.
Inotropes can be initiated for persistent hypoperfusion once adequate MAP is achieved.
Dobutamine 2.5 µg/kg/min is first-line, rapidly titrate as needed and initial doses may need to be higher.
Epinephrine 2-10 µg/min to be titrated as needed. Epinephrine is second-line.
Hypoxemia and hypercapnia should be corrected through non-invasive means, including a high-flow nasal cannula.
Avoid intubation if at all possible.
If intubation cannot be avoided, hypotension must be prevented during and after the procedure.
Disposition
Home
Patients with known PH who are at their baseline, without new symptoms, and with a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygenation may be discharged.
Well-appearing patients with suspected PH should have a walking oxygen saturation evaluation. Those who do not desaturate may be discharged with outpatient follow-up, with strong consideration for echocardiogram.
Admission
All patients with PH who are off their baseline (ie, hemodynamic or respiratory abnormality) should be admitted.
Those patients who are on a stable dose of supplemental oxygen may be admitted to the floor.
Those patients with escalating oxygen requirements or on hemodynamic support (ie, continuous infusion of a vasoactive agent) should be admitted to the ICU.",Pulmonary Hypertension
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
Approximately 0.75%-1% of ED patients have PH.
The condition is heterogeneous, under-appreciated, and poorly documented.
One study in patients with pulmonary artery systolic pressures over 60 mm Hg by echocardiogram found that only 17% had a diagnosis of PH documented in their medical record.  Conversely, approximately 20% of patients with dyspnea and negative work-ups in the ED later had echocardiograms concerning for PH. 
Approximately 65%-70% of Group 1 PH patients are women, and hospitalization and mortality rates are higher in women.  However, among all PH patients, there is a male predominance at a ratio of 1.8:1. 
Pathophysiology
The pulmonary vascular bed is normally a high-flow, low-pressure system. When there is an increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), the RV cannot adapt as well as the LV, leading to dilation. 
When faced with an acute increase in PVR, the RV can only generate systolic pressures up to 40-50 mm Hg. 
With gradual, chronic changes, the RVSP can become equal to systemic pressures, up to 80 or even 110 mm Hg.
Volume overload, pressure overload, and dilation eventually lead to tricuspid regurgitation. Figure
Normally, the RV is perfused in both systole and diastole, given the low RV pressures. Upon increased pressures within the RV, the wall tension leads to decreased right coronary artery perfusion and eventual RV ischemia. 
RV failure can develop with PH progression or an acute or chronic insult, particularly one that decreases RV perfusion or further increases PVR. This is why hypotension, decreasing RCA perfusion, or hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or positive-pressure ventilation can be so detrimental. 
The relationship between the RV and LV cavities is known as interventricular dependence. When the RV bulges with volume and pressure overload into the LV, the LV has decreased filling.  Figure
The RV is a conical structure and contracts in systole against the interventricular septum. Distortion of the RV not only decreases LV filling but also further decreases effective RV contractility.
There are 5 groups of PH, corresponding to the underlying etiology. 
Group 1: Includes idiopathic PH, PH related to medications or toxins, and PH from congenital heart disease.
Group 2: Originates from left heart disease, including LV dysfunction and valvular disease. This is the most common cause of PH in industrialized nations.
Group 3: Develops from chronic hypoxemia and pulmonary diseases, such as COPD, interstitial lung disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. This is the second-most common cause of PH.
Group 4: This is known as chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH) and arises when there is incomplete resolution of a pulmonary embolism (PE), representing approximately 3% of PE patients.
Group 5: This is miscellaneous; nonetheless, it is important to recognize that the conditions included in this group are associated with PH, such as hemodialysis.
This classification was not intended to guide management decisions; however, understanding the etiology can influence appropriate management in the ED. For example, patients with PH from Groups 2 and 3 are best managed by aggressively treating the underlying condition.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Exertional dyspnea is the most common symptom of PH. 
Patients may present with chest pain from demand ischemia of the RV. 
With progressive RV failure, cardiac output becomes fixed and eventually falls, and patients may present with exertional syncope or presyncope.
In 20% of patients with Group 1 PH, the time between symptom development and diagnosis is >2 y. 
Patients do not usually present with hypoxemia at rest until the late stages of the disease.
PH patients will often present with exacerbations of the underlying condition, such as COPD or left-sided congestive heart failure exacerbation.
Given the tenuous hemodynamic state of PH, small physiologic insults can result in RV failure.
RV failure from PH is also challenging to recognize and may be confused for left-sided heart failure, a pulmonary embolism, a COPD flare, or sepsis. Further complicating the presentation, all these conditions and others may coexist in a patient with PH.
In addition to dyspnea, patients with RV failure may complain of chest pain from RV ischemia.
The physical exam in PH commonly demonstrates evidence of volume overload, with elevated jugular venous pulsations, pedal edema, and abdominal distention. With progression, patients may develop the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation, with a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. 
Patients may be in cardiogenic shock, with cool extremities, slow capillary refill, a narrow pulse pressure, and evidence of volume overload.
PH and RV failure will not present with pulmonary edema on exam or imaging unless associated with concomitant LV failure.
Some patients are maintained on continuous infusions of pulmonary vasodilators in the community. If these patients present with a disruption of their vasodilator, this is an emergency and should be addressed promptly. The prescribing physician should be contacted immediately while additional access or medication is obtained to resume the administration. 
PH patients may also present with emergencies completely unrelated to their PH. In these instances, one must recognize the PH and avoid exacerbating the condition, such as not performing a procedural sedation or administering unnecessary large volume fluid boluses.
ECG
ECG in PH is non-sensitive and non-specific, in part due to the heterogeneity of the condition. 
Findings can include enlarged, peaked P waves in the inferior leads (P pulmonale) from right atrial enlargement. ECG
Right ventricular hypertrophy manifests in the ECG as an R/S ratio >1 or an R wave >7 mm in lead V1. Other findings include R-axis deviation or right bundle branch block. ECG
T wave inversions in the precordial leads, especially V2-3, can be signs of RV strain. ECG
Radiographic Evaluation
Comprehensive echocardiography is the most common and important screening test for PH. Although PA line placement is required for diagnosis, confirming a mean PA pressure >25 mm Hg, PH should be suspected in patients with an RVSP or PASP >35 mm Hg or a tricuspid jet velocity >3.4 m/s. 
The RV or RA may demonstrate enlargement, and RV function may be decreased. Patients with PH may also demonstrate RV hypertrophy. These parameters are assessed in the apical 4-chamber view. Image
RV volume and pressure overload can be evaluated in the parasternal short-axis view. The normally round LV may be flattened at the interventricular septum, which is known as the “D sign.” Image Image
The echocardiogram should be reviewed for TAPSE. Normal values are >1.6 cm. Image
Mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding on echocardiogram; however, moderate or severe TR is concerning for chronic PH. Image
Bedside cardiac U/S is a particularly useful imaging modality in the ED.
While this cannot distinguish acute from chronic changes, emergency physicians can check for RV dilation on the apical 4-chamber view and intraventricular septal deviation on the parasternal short-axis view.
A study comparing ED-limited bedside studies with contemporarily performed comprehensive echocardiograms found that the kappa for fellowship-trained physicians and cardiologists was 0.55 in identifying RV dilation.
The ED U/S studies had a high specificity for RV dilation at 98% but marginal sensitivity at 26%. 
Chest radiography is non-specific. Patients may have enlarged, globular hearts, but determining RV or PA enlargement on plain films is challenging. Unless associated with LV failure or pulmonary disease, the lung fields will be clear. Image Image A normal chest radiograph does not exclude PH. 
CT can be useful for evaluating the pulmonary vascular system. Unlike the aorta, which has an established upper limit of normal for diameter, definitions of PA enlargement are more nebulous. However, a PA diameter >2.9 cm suggests PH and correlates with the symptoms of dyspnea.  Image
RV changes on CT also indicate PH, including hypertrophy, defined as an RV wall thickness >4 mm or dilation with an RV:LV ratio >1.  Image
Rapid reflux of IV contrast back into the hepatic veins indicates tricuspid regurgitation. 
Chest CT can also assist in identifying associated conditions or etiologies of PH. For example, CT may demonstrate CTEPH or interstitial lung disease.
Laboratory Evaluation
CBC are usually normal but may show elevated hemoglobin levels if the patient is chronically hypoxic. 
LFT may demonstrate congestive hepatopathy. Congestion is indicated by elevations in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubins.  In severe cases of RV failure, transaminases may be elevated from shock liver. The classic finding in shock liver is an alanine aminotransferase:lactate dehydrogenase (ALT:LDH) ratio <1:1.5. 
Creatinine may be normal early in the condition but elevations can occur due to renal dysfunction from decreased perfusion and venous congestion. 
Lactate elevations indicate cardiogenic shock from RV failure. 
Brain natriuretic peptides are usually elevated.
Therapeutic Considerations
In patients presenting with an exacerbation of an underlying condition, such as COPD or left-sided chronic heart failure (CHF), that condition should be treated aggressively.
PH patients presenting with other conditions should be treated with care to avoid worsening PH and RV failure, such as avoiding sedation and resulting hypercapnia or administering large IV fluid boluses.
The traditional resuscitation techniques of “airway, breathing, and circulation,” referring to early intubation, positive-pressure ventilation, and assertive IVF administration, should be avoided in patients with PH.
A better therapeutic strategy is to focus on optimizing preload, contractility, and afterload in PH patients requiring resuscitation.
Patients with PH are very complex and challenging to manage in the best of circumstances.
Once the condition is recognized, early consultation with a PH specialist is warranted.
Preload
Preload should be optimized in all patients with PH. The classic teaching in acute RV failure from a right-sided MI, for example, is that these patients are preload-dependent; however, patients with CHF, including PH, are more likely to be volume-overloaded than dry due to upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. 
Additional fluids in the setting of marginal RV function can increase pulmonary pressures, worsen venous congestion, and paradoxically decrease cardiac output by shifting the interventricular septum to the left, decreasing LV filing and worsening RV contractility.
Standard assessments of volume-responsiveness do not apply to the chronic pathophysiologic changes of PH. Given the chronic venous congestion, U/S measurements of the inferior vena cava are of limited use.
If a patient with PH does seem dry, judicious fluid boluses of 250 mL should be administered with careful reassessment after each. 
More often, diuresis is indicated to improve RV contractility and LV filling.
Since gauging the volume responsiveness in patients with PH and RV dysfunction can be so challenging, and administering diuretics in the ED without clear data to guide management can be concerning, patients with RV failure from PH should be considered for early pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC) placement.  PACs do not improve outcomes in routine shock management but they may be useful in cardiogenic shock from RV failure. 
Contractility
Early vasopressor use is appropriate in PH to maintain RV perfusion and thereby maintain contractility.
There have been no studies regarding a target MAP goal in RV failure leading to cardiogenic shock, but 65 mm Hg is a commonly accepted target. 
Norepinephrine is the first-line agent.
Vasopressin does not result in an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and as such, is an excellent second-line agent. Vasopressin is especially useful if the patient is becoming tachycardic with norepinephrine. 
Once the MAP is optimized, the patient should be reassessed for their perfusion. In cases of continued poor perfusion, inotropes should be added.
Dobutamine is the first-line inotrope for the ED, since it is short-acting and does not accumulates in kidney injury. 
Milrinone is an excellent inotrope in RV failure, with purported pulmonary vasodilating properties; however, its onset of action and half-life are longer, making titration challenging. Moreover, milrinone accumulates in kidney injury, further reducing its titratability.
Epinephrine is an appropriate additional agent. Norepinephrine is preferred for hypotension with cardiogenic shock, but in cases of persistent hypotension, epinephrine should be added at 0.05-2 µg/kg/min to be titrated as needed to achieve blood pressure and distal perfusion.
Patients with PH do not tolerate arrhythmias well, and they should be cardioverted if possible to try to maintain a normal sinus rhythm.  Electrical cardioversion is appropriate if there are no contraindications, and amiodarone is a first-line agent for rhythm control. 
For PH patients with signs of RV failure, negative inotropes such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers should be avoided.
Afterload
In chronic PH, the major pathology lies in increased afterload, also known as PVR. Therefore, correcting the afterload, or at least preventing further increases in afterload, is critical.
PVR is increased by acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxia due to hypoxic vasoconstriction,  making correction of respiratory insufficiency important to protect the patient’s hemodynamic status.
Positive-pressure ventilation can decrease preload, increase PVR, and thereby precipitate cardiovascular collapse, especially if coupled with sedating agents that reduce adrenergic tone.  Accordingly, intubation should be avoided if at all possible.
A high-flow nasal cannula is an excellent alternative to reverse hypoxic vasoconstriction without the risks of intubation. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation may be attempted, noting that it can be removed if the patient does not tolerate the mask.
Note that patients with PH from left-sided heart failure or primary pulmonary disease usually benefit from non-invasive ventilation, since this represents aggressive treatment of their underlying condition.
If the patient must be intubated, this procedure should be recognized as being very high-risk. All necessary equipment, including back-up equipment, should be ready for immediate use. The most experienced clinician should manage the airway to minimize the apneic time in order to reduce hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
Hypotension must be avoided during the intubation. If the blood pressure is marginal, start norepinephrine prior to induction. Etomidate or ketamine should be used as induction agents to minimize the risk of hypotension.
Once the patient is intubated, use low tidal volume ventilation and low positive-end expiratory pressures to reduce PVR. However, atelectasis can also lead to increased PVR. Discussion with a PH specialist is essential for all intubated PH patients.
Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, including nitric oxide and epoprostenol, can offload the RV and reduce PVR.  Given the low systemic absorption, their effect on blood pressure is minimal but they can improve cardiac output.
Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators can be initiated via an endotracheal tube, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula.  These should not be used in patients with primary LV failure, since this can lead to increased volume delivery to the left side and worsening pulmonary edema.
Inhaled epoprostenol is initiated at 30 ng/kg/min with a range of 10-50. Once started, it should never be stopped abruptly, since this can provoke rebound PH. Consultation with a pulmonologist or pharmacist for dosing is recommended.
IV pulmonary vasodilators can precipitate cardiopulmonary collapse if used incorrectly. As such, these agents should only be used by a PH specialist in the ICU.
Patients with PH are often on oral medications, such as the phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors, tadalafil or sildenafil, or endothelin receptor antagonists such as macitentan or bosentan. These medications will never be initiated by an emergency physician, and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this work. However, ED patients may need to take these medications during their ED visit, and the dosages should not be missed if at all possible. If a patient is unable to take oral medications, discussion with the prescribing physician to develop an alternative plan is essential.
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
Patients who present with PH but have other, unrelated conditions and are at their cardiopulmonary baseline can be discharged. However, given the complexity of their condition, notifying their PH physician of the ED visit is appropriate, since even seemingly trivial or unrelated matters (eg, a sprained ankle treated with NSAIDs) may lead to complications.
Patients without critical illness but who require admission should be admitted to telemetry in most cases, given the risks of hemodynamic perturbations with any change in their physiology.
Patients with RV failure from PH will require ICU admission.
Some PH patients may have severe or refractory shock. These patients should be transferred to a center with mechanical circulatory support options, including ECMO. 
Prevention
Emergency physicians cannot prevent PH but do have an opportunity to identify its hallmarks. Patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea should have walking oxygen saturation checked in the ED. Those who do not desaturate are safe to be discharged but should be referred for an outpatient echocardiogram. Given the documented delays in diagnosis,  this is an opportunity for the emergency physician to recognize potential PH and change the course of illness.",Pulmonary Hypertension
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Place the patient on a cardiac monitor and establish IV access.
Obtain a 12-lead ECG.
If the patient is pulseless and presents with ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (VT), perform immediate defibrillation and chest compressions.
If the patient is unstable:
Perform synchronized cardioversion for monomorphic VT and other tachydysrhythmias under procedural sedation if possible (150−200 J biphasic). Ensure that the device is not syncing to the T-wave.
Unstable polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT) may require defibrillation if electrical cardioversion is not possible due to the very rapid rates.
Assess whether the suspected tachydysrhythmia is the cause of the patient’s instability or whether the tachycardia is a compensatory effect (ie, rapid atrial fibrillation [AF] secondary to sepsis).
Use bedside U/S to help determine the underlying etiology. Evidence of left ventricular (LV) volume overload implies that the rapid response is primary, whereas evidence of LV volume depletion points toward a compensatory response. Bedside U/S can also assess for pericardial tamponade, LV function, right ventricular (RV) function, volume, and pulmonary edema.
Consider a trial of calcium chloride 1 g IV bolus through a reliable IV access if there is any concern for hyperkalemia as the cause. This treatment is safe even if the diagnosis is not confirmed.
Order labs, including electrolytes, renal function, and troponin. Use the clinical context to decide whether to order D-dimer and brain natriuretic peptide.
Patients with refractory or recurrent ventricular dysrhythmia secondary to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should undergo emergency coronary angiography.
Even in the absence of myocardial infarction (MI), an elevated troponin level suggests that the tachycardia is not well tolerated; therefore, it is reasonable to check troponin levels in all patients presenting with tachydysrhythmias, with the exception of younger and otherwise clearly healthy patients.
See the table- Management of Unstable Tachycardia Table for patients who remain unstable despite the above-mentioned therapies.
Key Concepts
Simplified approach to tachycardia video lecture EM:RAP Video
Clinical presentations of tachydysrhythmias range from asymptomatic patients with prior non-specific symptoms to sudden cardiac death.
ED evaluation begins by determining whether the dysrhythmia is the primary cause of the clinical symptoms or a compensatory response to another pathology.
Rhythms can be categorized based on the QRS width (wide vs. narrow) and the rate variation (regular vs. irregular).
Categorization of rhythms offers an immediate approach to the differential diagnosis and treatment without requiring a specific rhythm diagnosis. Table
A narrow QRS complex is supraventricular, while a wide QRS complex implies either ventricular origin and/or abnormal conduction by structural (fascicular or bundle branch blocks [BBBs]) or metabolic (hyperkalemia, acidosis, Na+ channel blockade) causes.
In the absence of hyperkalemia or other toxicologic/metabolic causes of QRS widening, the differential of a wide regular tachycardia is VT vs. supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy. It is safest to assume VT until proven otherwise.
Stable vs. unstable is the initial branch point in management.
Unstable conditions confer an imminent risk of further deterioration, irreversible organ injury, or cardiac arrest and include the following:
Symptomatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure [MAP] <65 mm Hg) with hypoperfusion to vital organs believed to be causing imminent and irreversible dysfunction
Acute altered mental status or obtundation
Ischemic chest pain
Dyspnea from pulmonary congestion
Extremely rapid ventricular rates approaching 300/min, as seen with PMVT and AF with ventricular pre-excitation
Pearls and Pitfalls
All atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents, including adenosine, should be avoided in wide complex tachycardias (WCTs) that are irregular and polymorphic (ie, beat-to-beat variation in QRS complex morphology) and/or with an extremely short R-R interval (less than 250 ms), since these are indicators of AF with an accessory pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome) that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF).
Application of a magnet is indicated for recurrent inappropriate shocks and/or pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, since a magnet can stop the anti-tachycardia function (defibrillation and cardioversion) of an implanted cardiac device (ICD) as well as the sensing function of a pacemaker. (See Chapter: Pacemakers)
The management of stable primary AF and atrial flutter (AFl) typically involves rate vs. rhythm control via pharmacologic and/or electrical therapy. (See Chapter: Atrial Fibrillation)
Key Diagnostic Elements
ECG is the cornerstone of diagnosis.
ECG prior to and following termination of tachydysrhythmia can reveal important information regarding structural disease, acute ischemia, or arrhythmia syndromes including WPW syndrome, arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Categorization of the QRS as wide vs. narrow and the rate as regular vs. irregular offers an immediate approach to differential diagnosis. Table
Among regular tachycardias, sinus tachycardia (ST) is commonly misdiagnosed as a tachydysrhythmia. ST is best identified by a biphasic, up-down, P-wave in lead V1 that is simultaneous with a fully upright deflection at the corresponding location in lead II.
Patients with intermittent symptoms of anxiety or panic often have unrecorded paroxysmal SVT (PSVT) (or other dysrhythmias). Ambulatory monitoring is helpful in such cases.
When the differential is VT vs. SVT, VT is more common.
The likelihood of VT increases further with increasing age, cardiac history, and QRS duration.
A QRS duration >140ms is more likely to be VT. The wider the QRS, the more likely it is to be VT. By 200 ms, the rhythm is almost always due to either classic VT or a toxicologic/metabolic condition (eg, type Ia medication toxicity, hyperkalemia).

Disposition
Ventricular Tachydysrhythmias
Disposition of VT generally requires admission for reversal of the underlying cause, telemetry, and cardiology consultation.
Ongoing electrical instability in the setting of ACS (regardless of the presence or absence of ST elevation) is an indication for emergency transfer to the catheterization suite, according to the 2014 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) NSTEMI guidelines and the 2011 European NSTE ACS guidelines.
Supraventricular Tachydysrhythmias
Disposition is based on patient comorbidities, post-conversion ECG findings, and severity of symptoms during the episode, in addition to the patient’s ability to tolerate the symptoms should they return after discharge.
Older patients with comorbidities and evidence of hemodynamic intolerance, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or syncope during SVT, likely require admission.
Charting Pearls
Document the clinical findings of instability that qualify the patient for unstable tachydysrhythmia treatments.
Acute altered mental status or obtundation.

Introduction
Tachydysrhythmias are common and potentially dangerous disease processes that often require rapid evaluation and intervention in the ED.
Emergency physicians must be able to accurately diagnose the condition and subsequently determine the need for and type of intervention.
Assessment of the patient’s stability is paramount, since unstable patients often require synchronized cardioversion, while stable patients can usually be treated by methods ranging from non-pharmacologic maneuvers to antidysrhythmic medications.
Abbreviations
Abbreviations- Table
Supraventricular Tachydysrhythmias (SVT)
Epidemiology
The term “SVT” refers to a group of tachydysrhythmias that require the atrium, AV node, or bundle of His for origination and propagation.
In this review, the term SVT includes AVNRT, AVRT, AT, MAT, SNRT, IST, and JT. Although AFl and AF satisfy this definition, they are generally not included in the term SVT. (See Chapter: Atrial Fibrillation)
The term paroxysmal SVT (PSVT) refers to a clinical syndrome of tachycardia with abrupt onset and termination.
The results of a retrospective NHAMCS database study suggest approximately 50,000 U.S. ED visits per year for SVT, with most patients being <65 y old, female, and Caucasian. 
Women are twice as likely as men to develop PSVT during their lifetime, and elderly patients >65 y old have 5 times the risk of those aged <65 y. 
Men with PSVT are generally more likely to have coexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) than females (90% vs. 48%, P = .05). 
“Lone SVT” describes a clinical syndrome of PSVT without any other known CVD.
Lone SVT accounts for almost half of all females who present with SVT but only 10% of males.
Those with lone SVT are younger (37 vs. 69 y old), have PSVT with higher heart rates (186 vs. 155 bpm), and have a higher proportion of AVNRT.
Pathophysiology
All SVTs are disorders of abnormal action potential formation (automatic dysrhythmias) and/or abnormal conduction (reentrant dysrhythmias).
Automatic dysrhythmias
Caused by rhythmic action potentials (APs) from a single focus, as determined by phase 4 of the cardiac AP, similar to the sinoatrial (SA) node during sinus rhythm.
Characterized by gradual acceleration and deceleration, significant beat-to-beat variability, and poor response to electricity or adenosine given their recurrent nature.
Includes most atrial tachycardia (AT), junctional tachycardia (JT), and multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT).
As in ST, adrenergic stimulation is a common underlying cause of enhanced automaticity rhythms.
Further subdivided into enhanced automaticity (normal pacemaker cells) and “triggered automaticity” (abnormal pacemaker cells, usually due to insults such as myocardial ischemia or recent surgery).
Reentrant dysrhythmias
Can be characterized by the location and mechanism of reentry.
Due to continuous propagation of APs in loop formations through the myocardium.
Require 2 separate pathways that differ in conduction speed and refractory periods, such that a properly timed additional AP can enter one pathway while the other is initially refractory, enabling the AP to access the second pathway retrogradely and create a continuous loop by accessing the 2 pathways in series rather than in parallel.
Includes AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), AFl, and some forms of AT.
Their reliance on a continuous loop of conduction makes them well suited for treatments that involve transient blockade, including vagal maneuvers, adenosine, or electricity.
The 2 most common forms of reentrant dysrhythmias (AVNRT and AVRT) are also the most common causes of SVT.
Classification of SVTs
Sinus Tachycardia (ST)
ST is defined as sinus rhythm ≥100 bpm.
Sinus rhythm is the normal, automatic rhythm from the SA node producing the characteristic sinus P-wave and PR interval.
Sinus P-waves are usually best visualized in lead II as a monophasic positive deflection and lead V1 as a biphasic (up-down) deflection.
The QRS complex in ST is regular and narrow unless there is intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), BBB, or some form of aberrancy.
As in other automatic rhythms, the ventricular rate will gradually rise and fall, with the maximum rate approximated by the formula (220 – age) or [200 – ½(age)].
“Appropriate” sinus rhythm is considered a normal physiologic response to any physical, pharmacologic, or emotional stressor and is mediated by autonomic tone, in addition to neuroendocrine and other unknown factors.
Thus, ST is best perceived in the ED as a sign of underlying pathology, and the treatment is dependent on the underlying cause.
“Inappropriate” ST (IST) is a diagnosis of exclusion, defined as a persistently elevated resting heart rate (greater than 100 bpm) without, or out of proportion to, any such stressor.
Sinus Node Reentry Tachycardia (SNRT)
SNRT is a rare etiology of SVT.
The mechanism is essentially the same as that for AVNRT, but the micro-reentry loop is located in the SA node rather than in the AV node.
Similar to a normal sinus rhythm, the P-waves will usually have normal morphology on the surface ECG, and there will typically be a normal PR interval.
Similar to AVNRT, the rhythm should be regular and paroxysmal.
Premature Atrial Complexes (PACs)
During sinus rhythm, PACs produce a regularly irregular supraventricular rhythm with two distinct P-waves.
The PR intervals may be slightly different.
The rate of PACs may range from occasional to every other sinus beat (termed “atrial bigeminy”).
Atrial Tachycardia (AT)
AT may be micro-reentrant (most common, the focus of this section) or macro-reentrant.
AT is produced by a non-sinus atrial focus anywhere above the AV node and can be automatic or reentrant.
P-waves with normal or abnormal morphology and PR intervals will usually be seen before each QRS.
AT is regular, typically with a rate of 150-250 bpm, but the change in rate is dependent on the underlying mechanism (reentrant or autonomic).
Automatic AT begins gradually and is usually due to adrenergic stimulation of otherwise healthy atrial tissue.
Reentrant AT is paroxysmal and is usually caused by an abnormal atrium, such as following atrial surgery.
Causes of AT include a fever, electrolyte disturbances, acid−base disorders, drug toxicity (especially digitalis toxicity), hypoxia, and hyperthyroidism.
Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)
MAT is an uncommon cause of irregularly irregular SVT, which requires the presence of ≥3 distinct atrial foci.
The ventricular rate is usually 100-180 bpm, and the rhythm is termed “wandering atrial pacemaker” if the rate is <100 bpm.
MAT is caused by enhanced automaticity of multiple atrial foci of various etiologies but is most commonly associated with chronic pulmonary disease.
Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT)
The rhythm is regular, and P-waves of various morphologies may be absent or seen before, during, or after the QRS complex. ECG
The reentrant mechanism gives AVNRT its paroxysmal onset and termination and explains its responsiveness to vagal maneuvers and adenosine.
Pathophysiology
Made possible by “dual AV nodal physiology,” in which the AV node is thought to contain 2 pathways that separate briefly and reunite inside the AV node, both conducting from the atria to the bundle of His.
The “fast pathway” exhibits faster conduction but a longer refractory period than the “slow pathway.”
In sinus rhythm, each AP propagates simultaneously down the dual AV nodal pathways without the opportunity for reentry, since the 2 pathways block each other at the point of reunification. Figure
The normal time between beats ensures that both pathways are available for the next AP.
However, a properly timed premature atrial beat may arrive early at the AV node, at a time when the fast pathway is still refractory but the slow pathway is fully repolarized and able to accept the oncoming AP.
The AP then proceeds anterogradely down the slow pathway only, during which the fast pathway completes its repolarization.
The AP arriving at the reunification point is then able to access the fast pathway, continuing retrogradely up the fast pathway and subsequently anterogradely down the slow pathway, sending APs to both the atria and ventricles.
This creates a regular tachycardia with retrograde P-waves that may occur before, during, or after the QRS complex.
Atrioventricular Reciprocating Tachycardia (AVRT)
AVRT is the second most common cause of PSVT. 
Pathophysiology
Macro-reentrant tachycardia requires an abnormal AV accessory pathway in addition to the AV node, similar to WPW syndrome.
The abnormal pathway is called an “accessory pathway,” “bypass tract,” or the “bundle of Kent” and may be available for anterograde conduction, retrograde conduction, or both.
Bypass tract capabilities may be permanent or transient based on various conditions.
In sinus rhythm, the AP originates at the SA node and enters the AV node and accessory pathway simultaneously (in parallel).
Although the AV node normally has slow conduction (causing the delay between the P-wave and the QRS), the bypass tract does not, and depolarization through the bypass tract begins first (“pre-excitation”).
Because the bypass tract does not connect directly to the specialized conduction system, the impulse traverses slowly through the myocardium.
Since slow conduction creates a wide QRS complex, this results in a wide initial deflection known as a “delta” wave.
When the AP from the AV node transmits down the conduction system, it rapidly converges with the AP from the bypass tract.
This manifests as a fusion beat, with an abnormal initial part of the QRS (delta wave) and a more normal-appearing latter part.
An appropriately timed premature contraction may find one pathway refractory, while the other is able to accept the premature impulse.
By the time the AP arrives at the other pathway, it has fully repolarized and can continue the circuit in series.
The macro-reentrant loop may proceed in an orthodromic or antidromic fashion. In both cases, P-waves may be absent or present before, during, or after the QRS complex.
Orthodromic AVRT
Proceeds down the AV node and subsequently up the bypass tract (narrow or baseline QRS complex). Orthodromic AVRT activates the ventricles using the intrinsic conduction system, resulting in QRS morphology identical to the patient’s baseline (unless rate-related BBB is present). ECG
Antidromic AVRT
Proceeds from the atria down the bypass tract into the ventricles and subsequently retrogradely up the AV node (wide QRS). Antidromic AVRT involves the spread of conduction through the myocardium without using the intrinsic conduction system, resulting in a WCT that is often indistinguishable from VT. ECG
Atrial Fibrillation
See Chapter: Atrial Fibrillation
Junctional Tachycardia (JT)
JT is an uncommon rhythm originating from the AV node or the bundle of His.
The mechanism is usually enhanced automaticity producing a regular ventricular rate rarely exceeding 140 bpm.
Retrograde P-waves may be seen or may be buried within the QRS complex.
The most common etiologies include digoxin toxicity, ischemia, cardiomyopathy, and increased adrenergic stimulation including stimulant drugs.
Ventricular Tachydysrhythmias (VT)
Epidemiology
Tachydysrhythmias originating in the ventricles include “classic” VT, idiopathic VT, PMVT, and pacemaker-mediated tachycardia.
Of these, “classic” VT ECG is overwhelmingly the most common and most important etiology encountered.
As with SVT, presentations range from asymptomatic to sudden cardiac death.
VF or pulseless VT occurs in 25−36% of witnessed cardiac arrests at home and 38−79% of witnessed cardiac arrests in public. 
VT is an important source of mortality in patients with structural heart disease.
The cause of VT varies widely with age, with a higher prevalence of channelopathies and cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, and substance abuse among younger patients, while older populations suffer more ventricular dysrhythmias due to chronic degenerative diseases (CAD, valvular heart disease, and congestive heart failure [CHF]).
Pathophysiology
Since all VTs originate in the ventricles, they do not access the intrinsic conduction system and therefore produce a wide QRS complex.
The mechanisms of ventricular dysrhythmias are more commonly reentrant, with perhaps the most common etiology being “scar-mediated” reentrant circuit VT, but some ventricular tachydysrhythmias may also be generated by automatic rhythms.
Primary VF and PMVT without the presence of QT prolongation on the baseline ECG most commonly occur in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction. ECG
In contrast, monomorphic VT most commonly occurs in association with a myocardial scar due to prior MI.
PMVT with the presence of QT prolongation (“torsades de pointes”) on the baseline ECG occurs due to congenital or acquired causes, but can also occur during the subacute phase of MI, roughly 7 d post-onset. 
Classification of VT
Classic VT
The most common cause of wide complex regular tachycardia.
Originates in the (usually pathologic) myocardium, which is associated with advanced age, CVD, structural heart disease, and/or ischemia.
Classic VT is associated with the prognosis of its underlying etiology and is generally considered to have a significant rate of deterioration and hemodynamic compromise.
Basic Differences Between Classic and Idiopathic VT Table
Idiopathic VT (IVT)
Refers to a group of tachydysrhythmias originating below the AV node and bundle of His but differing from classic VT in etiology, prognosis, and treatment.
The term “idiopathic” is becoming increasingly inappropriate, since various specific subgroups and etiologies are constantly being discovered.
IVTs are more commonly seen in younger, healthier patients than in the typical classic VT patient and are generally considered to have excellent prognosis with low rates of hemodynamic compromise and rhythm deterioration.
The much better prognosis of IVT is largely due to the absence of pathologic myocardium and the corresponding normal contractility and ejection fraction.
These dysrhythmias often respond to antidysrhythmic medications that would ordinarily be ineffective or even contraindicated in classic VT.
In addition to many other obscure rhythms, there are at least 3−4 subgroups of IVT:
Right Ventricular Outflow Tract VT (RVOT VT)
Mechanism: Triggered activity originating in the RVOT, which subsequently accesses part of the nearby conduction system (thought to be the right bundle branch [RBB] within the septum)
Basic ECG characteristics: Precordial left BBB (LBBB) pattern with inferior frontal plane axis
Treatment: Usually responsive to adenosine
Associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (AVRC)
Variants: A similar arrhythmia has been described to originate from the LV outflow tract, with RBBB morphology and an inferior frontal plane axis (RBBB + left posterior fascicular block morphology). Response to treatment is unknown
See ECG
Fascicular Left Ventricular Tachycardia
Mechanism: Reentrant arrhythmia originating in or near specific parts of the intrinsic conduction system of the LV 
Subtypes: There are at least 3 subtypes based on the location, with the two most important being posterior fascicle VT (most common by far) and anterior fascicle VT
Basic ECG characteristics
Posterior fascicle VT: Precordial RBBB morphology with left axis deviation (or left anterior fascicular block morphology) in the frontal plane
Anterior fascicle VT: Precordial RBBB morphology with right axis deviation (or LPFB morphology) in the frontal plane
Treatment: Posterior fascicle VT is usually thought to be sensitive to verapamil, while anterior fascicle VT does not appear to have a consistently reported pharmacologic treatment
See ECG
Bundle Branch Reentrant Tachycardia (BBRVT)
Mechanism: Reentrant loop including at least one portion of the intrinsic conduction system. Unlike other IVTs, BBRVT is more often associated with underlying structural heart disease.11 Figure
Basic ECG characteristics: Depending on the bundles/fascicles involved and the direction of conduction, any combination of bundle branch and/or fascicular block morphology can be produced. The most common type reported appears to access the RBB anterogradely and the LBB retrogradely, causing the ECG to show LBBB morphology.
Treatment: This group of arrhythmias does not appear to have an effective pharmacologic treatment. Neither adenosine nor verapamil have been reported to be consistently effective for these rhythms; however, these rhythms are so rare that research is severely limited.
ECG
Pacemaker-mediated Tachycardia (PMT)
An increasingly rare group of VTs characterized by a ventricular-paced rhythm that is inappropriately tachycardic, in which the pacemaker itself is part of the cycle causing tachycardia
Generally occurs in the setting of a dual-chamber pacemaker
Mechanism(s)
PMT can occur in a patient who still has an intact AV node and is initiated by a premature ventricular contraction (PVC), which causes a retrograde AP up the AV node followed by retrograde atrial depolarization.
The atrial lead of the dual-chamber pacemaker is designed to detect inherent atrial activity; thus, it detects the retrograde P-wave and triggers an impulse via the ventricular lead.
The resulting ventricular AP starts from the ventricular lead and arrives at the AV node after it has repolarized and is ready to accept another retrograde AP, thereby continuing the reentrant loop. 
Another mechanism of PMT occurs when a patient with a dual-chamber pacemaker develops any AT that is sensed by the atrial lead, triggering a matching ventricular-paced beat up to the maximal ventricular output rate setting of the pacemaker. 
Treatment: Application of a magnet turns off the anti-tachycardia function (including defibrillation and synchronized cardioversion) of an ICD, as well as the sensing function of a pacemaker (rendering the device simply a pacemaker at a set rate regardless of the patient’s intrinsic function).
Diagnosing Tachydysrhythmias
The targeted differential diagnosis of any tachydysrhythmia is readily available based on simple ECG findings.
SVTs are first divided into 4 categories based on whether the QRS complexes are regular or irregular and narrow (<120 ms) or wide (≥120 ms).
The resulting 4 categories each have limited differential and empiric treatment strategies, such that a specific diagnosis is not usually required for immediate management. Table Algorithm
Narrow vs. Wide
Narrow QRS
A narrow QRS complex is evidence that the rhythm originated no lower than the bundle of His and was transmitted down a functional conduction system.
All SVTs should therefore have a narrow QRS complex in the absence of aberrant conduction (which includes aberrancy due to hyperkalemia or sodium channel blockers), pre-existing BBB, or an accessory pathway.
Wide Complex QRS
A wide QRS complex implies either ectopic origin and/or abnormal conduction (aberrancy).
Almost all VTs must produce a wide QRS complex; the only theoretical exception being some cases of IVT that originate in the conduction system itself and may very rarely manage to create a QRS complex in just under 120 ms.
While narrow complex tachycardias can reliably be diagnosed as SVTs, WCTs may be either VT or SVT with IVCD or aberrancy.
Ectopic origin: Ventricular-paced rhythm, VT, and accessory pathway-mediated tachycardias.
In these cases, the AP spreads from cell to cell without using the specialized conduction system, resulting in a prolonged depolarization and a wide QRS.
Aberrancy: When the AP travels appropriately down the conduction system, aberrancy can result from either structural or metabolic causes.
Structural causes: Fascicular and bundle branch blocks (which can be fixed or rate-dependent) and cardiomyopathy of various etiologies
Metabolic causes: Electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia), acidosis, and drug effects
Further analysis of ECG findings can be used for more precise rhythm characterization and treatment options.
After determining whether the QRS complexes are regular or irregular and narrow or wide, the clinician should determine the following ancillary information, if possible:
Presence or absence of P-waves
The relationship between the P-waves and the QRS complexes
The ventricular rate
Whether the ventricular rate is changing suddenly, gradually, or not at all
Retrograde P-waves indicate a non-sinus rhythm and are usually due to retrograde reentrant conduction, but can also be seen in low atrial automatic tachycardias.
A sudden change in the QRS rate characterizes reentrant rhythms, whereas a gradual rise and fall is typical of automatic rhythms.
Regularly irregular QRS complexes usually represent either 1) a regular rhythm with variable AV conduction or premature beats or 2) two separate competing regular rhythms.
However, if there is uncertainty, the clinician should presume an irregularly irregular rhythm due to the potential dangers of AV nodal blockade in irregular WCT.
Tachydysrhythmia Algorithm Table
VT vs. SVT with aberrancy
When the clinician encounters a WCT, a rapid bedside approach is required to differentiate VT from SVT with aberrancy.
The clinician should assume VT until proven otherwise.
VT is more common than SVT with aberrancy in the general population of patients presenting with WCT. VT is even more likely with increasing age and cardiac history.
The greater the QRS width, the greater the likelihood of VT.
VT usually generates a QRS duration of at least 140 ms, but the family of fascicular VTs is an exception to this rule, since these rhythms originate in the ventricular conduction system itself.
Most idiopathic/fascicular VTs have a QRS duration of 140 ms or less. 
A QRS duration of 140−200 ms or greater is either classic VT and/or hyperkalemia until proven otherwise.
If the initial portion of the QRS is conducted in a wide, unorganized, irregular manner, then classic VT is far more likely.
Conversely, if the initial portion of the QRS is conducted in a rapid, steep, organized manner similar to RBBB or LBBB morphology, this implies usage of the intrinsic conduction system, which takes place in SVT with aberrancy and in some IVTs.
If the morphology of the QRS complex is identical to that of a patient’s prior known aberrancy (documented prior LBBB, for example), the rhythm can be diagnosed as SVT.  Care must be taken in ensuring that the QRS complex has identical morphology, since there have been documented cases of near-identical morphology due to VT. 
AV dissociation (P-waves that are dissociated from the QRS complexes and therefore not the source of the QRS complexes) strongly favors VT.
Fusion or capture beats result from a supraventricular rhythm competing against VT by intermittently conducting between ventricular beats.
Unfortunately, rare case reports from electrophysiology labs have also documented the opposite: fusion beats (but not capture beats) created by premature ventricular complexes during proven SVT with aberrancy.
If the rate does not change during the transition from narrow to wide complex rhythms, SVT is the likely cause.
Precordial QRS concordance (all precordial leads with QRS complexes depolarizing in the same direction, either positive or negative, without an RS complex in any lead) is a strong sign of VT.
Despite many attempts and promising derivations, there are no ECG criteria or algorithms that have shown external validity and inter-observer agreement in differentiating classic VT from SVT with aberrancy. 
Many IVTs originate in the conduction system and cause VT with a morphology indistinguishable from SVT with BBB aberrancy.
For experienced EM electrocardiographers who wish to differentiate classic VT from IVT, we recommend 1 of 2 approaches that are opposite in concept, but both reflect logical and guideline-supported reasoning.
1. “Honey badger” approach
In this approach, the EM provider essentially ignores the existence of IVTs, assuming all wide complex regular monomorphic VT to be classic VT, thereby ensuring that a mistake in treatment can never be made as a result of misdiagnosing a rhythm as IVT when in fact it is not.
This approach emphasizes the inability to differentiate IVT from classic VT, the paucity of evidence regarding particular medical therapies for IVTs, and the fact that our ACC/AHA guidelines do not have any recommendations suggesting that EM providers should attempt to recognize IVT or treat it any differently than classic VT.
2. “Fancy pants” approach
For experienced ED physicians who want an approach that allows consideration and treatment of IVTs while respecting current guidelines and avoiding pitfalls in the case of misdiagnosis, we recommend the following strategy, which is based on QRS morphology in the setting of a stable patient with regular monomorphic WCT.
RBBB + LAFB (leftward frontal axis) morphology
The rhythm differential for this morphology includes classic VT, SVT with RBBB + LAFB, posterior fascicle VT, BBRVT, and other rare and obscure rhythms.
If there is a high clinical suspicion of IVTs rather than classic VT or SVT with RBBB + LAFB, posterior fascicle VT may be the most likely etiology.
Posterior fascicle VT is usually sensitive to verapamil; however, one must consider the chance of inadvertently giving verapamil to a patient with classic VT, which is formally contraindicated. 
Synchronized cardioversion (assuming avoidance of shocking on the T-wave) is the only therapy that is both safe and effective among all etiologies in this category.
Experts may consider administering verapamil if electricity does not work and the patient has very good LV function on bedside U/S and no history of cardiomyopathy, MI, heart failure, etc.
RBBB + LPFB (rightward frontal axis) morphology
The rhythm differential for this category includes classic VT, SVT with RBBB + LPFB, anterior fascicle VT, BBRVT, LVOT VT, and other rare and obscure rhythms.
If there is a high clinical suspicion of IVTs rather than classic VT or SVT with RBBB + LPFB, anterior fascicle VT may be the most likely etiology.
Anterior fascicle VT is thought to be somewhat less sensitive to verapamil than posterior fascicle VT, but there are some cases with reported efficacy; however, one must again consider the chance of inadvertently giving verapamil to a patient with classic VT, which is formally contraindicated.
Synchronized cardioversion (assuming avoidance of shocking on the T-wave) is the only therapy that is both safe and effective among all etiologies in this category.
LBBB + inferior frontal plane axis morphology
The rhythm differential in this category includes classic VT, SVT with LBBB, RVOT VT, BBRVT, and other rare and obscure rhythms.
If there is a high clinical suspicion of IVTs rather than classic VT or SVT with LBBB, RVOT VT is the most likely consideration in this category, which is typically adenosine-sensitive.
This is convenient, since adenosine is already indicated and recommended in our guidelines for stable, monomorphic WCT.
Again, synchronized cardioversion is the only therapy that is both safe and effective among all etiologies in this category.
However, adenosine is also a safe, indicated, and less invasive strategy in this situation.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Clinical presentation of tachydysrhythmias ranges widely from asymptomatic patients complaining only of prior non-specific symptoms to those with sudden death.
SVTs.
Stable patients with ongoing SVT will most likely complain of palpitations, fast heart rate, dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain or may use terms such as “pounding” or “fluttering” to describe their sensation. 
The most common symptoms of SVT are palpitations (96%), dizziness (75%), and dyspnea (47%). 
Syncope is reported in 10−20% of patients. 
Patients with SVT may rarely present with unstable arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death.
VTs.
Much more likely than SVTs to present with hemodynamic instability or to deteriorate during evaluation.
However, when stable, VT may present with symptoms identical to those of SVT.
In patients who are asymptomatic at the time of evaluation but complaining of paroxysmal episodes of non-specific symptoms, there is difficulty in differentiating PSVT (and theoretically also VT) from anxiety and/or panic disorders.
Lessmeier et al. performed a retrospective survey in 107 patients with reentrant PSVT and found that 67% had symptoms fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder.  Only 48 (45%) patients were correctly diagnosed upon initial evaluation; 55% were undiagnosed for a mean of 3.3 y following initial presentation, including 13 patients with apparent pre-excitation on resting ECG. Physicians initially attributed symptoms to “panic, anxiety or stress” in half of these patients, with women more likely than men to have their symptoms attributed to psychiatric causes (65% vs. 32%; P <.04).
History
A focused history of present illness, review of systems, and past medical history should include an evaluation for ischemia, known arrhythmias (especially including prior episodes and/or prior ablations), heart failure, pulmonary disease, thyroid disease, and ingestions capable of causing or contributing to tachydysrhythmias, including sympathomimetic medications, recreational drugs, and dietary supplements.
A family history of syncope, heart disease, and dysrhythmias is relevant but often not volunteered.
Physical Exam
With the exception of vital signs, a physical exam in a stable patient is usually unremarkable and rarely helpful in the evaluation of patients with suspected tachydysrhythmia.
Exam findings supporting hemodynamically threatening tachydysrhythmia include altered mental status, hypotension, poor peripheral circulation, diaphoresis, and pulmonary edema.
Evaluate the patient for signs of hypovolemia, CHF, anemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism.
The presence of a fistula should raise suspicion of hyperkalemia contributing to the arrhythmia, while the presence of a sternotomy scar or recent groin puncture implies important historical events.
12-lead ECG
The most important diagnostic test is the 12-lead ECG. Aside from the 3-lead monitor, it is also the first and most easily acquired test.
If possible, a rhythm strip showing the events prior to, during, and following conversion may be helpful for diagnosis by the emergency physician or consulting cardiologist.
After termination, the ECG also provides important information regarding structural disease, acute ischemia, or arrhythmia syndromes, including the following:
Pathologic Q-waves or other evidence of prior MI or structural heart disease may suggest scarring or another structural focus for VT.
WPW syndrome (delta waves, short PR interval). ECG
ARVD (inverted T-waves in the right precordial leads and epsilon waves). ECG
Long QT syndrome (beware of the poor sensitivity of automated algorithms in the measurement of the QT interval).
Brugada syndrome (rSR’, with a wide R’, in V1-V2, downsloping ST segment elevation, and inverted T-wave). ECG
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) (high voltage, large narrow R-wave in V1, and deep narrow Q-waves most commonly in the lateral leads). ECG
Lewis Leads
If the 12-lead recorded during tachydysrhythmia does not determine the diagnosis, it may be useful to record the Lewis leads. ECG
Lewis lead vectors are aligned across the right atrium and are perpendicular to the maximal ventricular depolarization vector, thereby exaggerating the P-wave voltage and making P-waves easier to discern.
In regular narrow complex tachycardia, ST may be diagnosed by the detection of upright P-waves before every QRS.
In regular WCT, VT may be diagnosed by the presence of P-waves that are dissociated from the QRS (AV dissociation). 
Lewis leads may be recorded with a 12-lead ECG but are more easily recorded with the monitor leads using the following steps: Figure
Place the right arm electrode on the patient’s manubrium.
Place the left arm electrode on the fifth intercostal space, right sternal border.
Place the left leg electrode on the right lower costal margin.
Monitor lead I.
Laboratory Evaluation
Serum electrolyte measurements may identify hypokalemia as the trigger of premature beats that initiate tachydysrhythmias.
A low thyroid-stimulating hormone level strongly implicates hyperthyroidism as the etiology of ST or as a trigger of premature beats that initiate other tachydysrhythmias.
Sympathomimetics can cause both ST and premature beats.
Screening assays that target cocaine are both sensitive and specific for cocaine and its primary metabolite, benzoylecognine; however, screens for other sympathomimetics (eg, amphetamines and synthetic stimulants) may be prone to false positives and false negatives due to the ubiquitous medicinal use of substances possessing amphetamine or amphetamine-like structures and the increasingly diverse supply of synthetic amphetamine derivatives available on the illicit market. Thus, such screens rarely improve upon a good medical history.
Cardiac troponin.
Troponin measurement in VT is clearly indicated in most circumstances given the general association with pre-existing comorbidities and the high likelihood that ACS is a contributing factor.
In contrast, SVT is rarely initiated by cardiac ischemia or ACS. If there is suspicion of ACS, measurement of troponin will help confirmation. In a study of a high-risk SVT population, neither ST depression nor an elevated troponin level identified patients with significant coronary disease. 
Conversely and more commonly, the SVT may precipitate cardiac ischemia and troponin elevation.
Some authors consider “positive” troponins in this situation to be a “false positive.” However, by definition, these patients have a type 2 MI.  Moreover, even a single elevated troponin level in patients with SVT is associated with an increased risk of death, MI, or rehospitalization at 1 y, independent of other clinical and ECG findings. 
An elevated troponin level suggests that the SVT is not well tolerated; therefore, with the exception of younger and otherwise clearly healthy patients, it is prudent to measure troponin and, if elevated, either admit the patient or advise very close follow-up.
Radiology
Echocardiography
Utilize point of care bedside U/S in stable patients in the ED.
Evaluate LV function and size, RV function (suspect pulmonary embolism with a large RV), and volume (IVC collapsibility), and check for the presence of pericardial effusion/tamponade or pulmonary edema (presence of B-lines).
Assessment of LV volume is a rapid way to determine whether the tachydysrhythmia is the initiating factor or a compensatory response, especially for ST and AF with a rapid ventricular response. Any evidence of LV volume overload implies that the rapid response is primary, whereas evidence of LV volume depletion implies that the rapid response is compensatory.
Chest Radiography
Patients with ventricular arrhythmias generally warrant a chest X-ray as part of the evaluation.
In the setting of SVT, a chest X-ray may identify cardiomyopathy (cardiomegaly) and pulmonary edema. Both may be either the cause or consequence of the tachydysrhythmia.
In patients with rapid AF or a first episode of SVT, a chest X-ray may be useful in identifying a precipitating cause such as pneumonia.
Ambulatory Monitoring
Consider at discharge for the following cases:
A stable, low-risk patient whose tachydysrhythmia has resolved but was not well characterized at the time of occurence
If SVT is suspected but is not recorded by monitoring or by 12-lead ECG during the patient’s evaluation
In patients with episodic palpitations or even transient panic disorder
In a randomized crossover clinical trial in patients with palpitations, 3-mo event monitors were less costly and twice as likely to provide a diagnosis than 48-h Holter monitoring (67% vs. 35%). 
Patients discharged with such monitors should keep a journal of subjective events.
Therapeutic Considerations
Prehospital Care
Prehospital care of tachydysrhythmias focuses on initial stabilization employing basic life support (BLS)/advanced cardiac life support (ACLS).
EMS personnel should perform a targeted medical history and physical exam, with attention to prior cardiac history, as well as medication and social history, to check for antiepileptic, caffeine, and street drug use.
If available, EMS personnel should attempt to transmit a 12-lead ECG to the base hospital.
Prehospital SVT Treatment
Several studies have examined the prehospital diagnosis of SVT without physician involvement.
Honarbakhsh et al. recently demonstrated a 98% correlation between paramedic and electrophysiologist interpretation of ECGs, with independent treatment lowering the time to discharge and the cost in the paramedic group. 
However, a prior prospective study showed that paramedics operating independently correctly identified SVT in only 76% of cases, with AF being the most commonly missed diagnosis. 
Madsen et al. found even poorer results, with only 43 of 73 (59%) tachydysrhythmias correctly identified as SVT by paramedics and base hospital physicians, indicating that this may not be only a prehospital concern. 
Multiple studies have shown a similar efficacy, adverse effect rate, and rate of recurrence between prehospital adenosine vs. verapamil. 
Prehospital VT Treatment
Prehospital management of VT has not been extensively studied.
Foerster et al. reported a retrospective prehospital series of 61 patients with stable sustained VT who were treated with amiodarone by paramedics.  Patients in cardiac arrest who received amiodarone after the return of spontaneous circulation were excluded. A total of 52% of patients given amiodarone experienced successful termination of VT during prehospital care. Two patients became hemodynamically unstable following amiodarone administration, requiring cardioversion; one other patient experienced cardiac arrest after amiodarone but was successfully resuscitated.
Fundamentals of ED Management
Rhythm: Cause or Effect?
The provider must judge whether the heart rate is the primary cause of the clinical symptoms or a compensatory response to another pathology.
Heart rates less than 150 bpm are unlikely to be the cause of unstable symptoms unless the patient has abnormal myocardium at baseline due to valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, etc.
If ST is present, the clinician should identify and treat the underlying cause (ie, sepsis, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, or volume depletion).
If the rhythm is suspected to be the cause of the patient’s symptoms, the next step is to assess the hemodynamic stability.
“Stable vs. Unstable”
ACLS guidelines define unstable as “a condition in which vital organ function is acutely impaired or cardiac arrest is ongoing or imminent,” yet suggest overly broad criteria to satisfy these conditions, including “ischemic chest discomfort” and “acute heart failure.” 
The ACLS dichotomy is confusing and oversimplified and does not align well with the wide spectrum of stability seen in clinical practice.
The presence of the following findings are more useful when determining a patient’s imminent risk of further deterioration, irreversible organ injury, or cardiac arrest:
Decreased mental status or obtundation
Symptomatic hypotension (SBP <90 mm Hg or MAP <65 mm Hg)
Hypoperfusion to vital organs believed to be causing imminent and irreversible dysfunction
PMVT
Pre-excited AF
Refer to Algorithm for a treatment algorithm that combines ACC/AHA ACLS and SVT guidelines with author recommendations Table.
Managing Unstable Tachycardia
Patients with unstable tachydysrhythmias should receive immediate synchronized cardioversion (150−200 J biphasic) under procedural sedation (when possible), with some exceptions and provisos (I, B). 
When performing synchronized cardioversion, the clinician must ensure that the monitor is not syncing on the T-wave to avoid the R-on-T phenomenon. ECG ECG
PMVT is treated as VF with unsynchronized defibrillation.
Sedation is unnecessary and dangerous if the patient is already obtunded.
Precordial thump may be considered for “witnessed, monitored, unstable VT if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use” (IIb, C). 
The use of adenosine in the setting of unstable tachycardia is controversial and depends on differentiating wide vs. narrow and regular vs. irregular tachycardia.
Both the ACLS and SVT guidelines caution that AV nodal blocking agents (including amiodarone) should be avoided in irregular or polymorphic WCT (with the exception of AF with known aberrancy), regardless of the QRS width or patient stability.
For patients with a regular monomorphic tachycardia (narrow or wide) who are symptomatic but not in extremis or at a high risk of immediate decompensation, consider adenosine and/or vagal maneuvers as an initial option prior to cardioversion if SVT is strongly suspected clinically or based on the ECG.
Adenosine for unstable narrow complex tachycardia
An initial trial of adenosine or vagal maneuvers (if feasible) is recommended in patients with undifferentiated regular narrow complex tachycardia unless the patient is truly unstable (IIB,C). 
Adenosine for unstable wide complex
Adenosine is contraindicated in “unstable” undifferentiated WCT (III, C)  unless the rhythm is regular and known to be supraventricular (I, B-R). 
Amiodarone is used in critically ill patients and those with monomorphic VT associated with clear ongoing ACS and/or cardiac arrest. See Chapter: Acute Coronary Syndromes and See Chapter: Cardiac Arrest
Recurrent or Refractory VT/VF
Recurrent or refractory VT or VF is often termed “electrical storm.”
VT may be refractory to electrical therapy or recur shortly after termination.  In these situations, recurrent electrical therapy may be nonproductive and possibly harmful. 
Electrical storm classically occurs in the setting of ischemic cardiomyopathy, but not necessarily during acute ischemia or MI.
Beta blockade or even sedation with propofol to decrease sympathetic tone can be helpful. 
In combination with amiodarone, the non-specific beta blocker propranolol appears to be more effective than metoprolol to calm electrical storm in ICD patients without obvious acute ischemia. 
In patients with acute ischemia and recurrent VTs, expeditious reperfusion is usually the greatest priority.
VT in Acute MI
Acute MI, particularly ST-elevated MI (STEMI), may present primarily as sudden death due to VT/VF, or these rhythms may occur during ED evaluation for ACS.
Note that VT in the setting of cardiac ischemia is usually polymorphic rather than monomorphic.
Recurrence of VTs in these settings is common. 
Recent studies suggest that lidocaine, procainamide, and the class III agent amiodarone do not improve the neurologic outcome or mortality to hospital discharge when administered acutely to prevent recurrent or refractory VF after sudden cardiac death.  Amiodarone, however, improves survival to hospital admission, possibly due to suppression of subsequent events. 
There is ample evidence that beta blockade lowers the risk of VTs and mortality both acutely and chronically in the setting of acute MI. 
However, beta blockade can be detrimental in patients with CHF or a low ejection fraction. 
Reperfusion is the best treatment for prevention of VT.
Managing Stable Tachycardia
Subdivision into 4 categories by QRS width and regularity allows for a manageable differential diagnosis and provides immediate empiric therapy without the need for a precise rhythm diagnosis. Table
In general, reentrant arrhythmias will respond to short-term therapy directed at blocking the AV node, whereas recurrent reentrant rhythms and automatic arrhythmias will typically require long-acting therapies for suppression while the underlying cause is found and corrected.
Stable Narrow Complex, Regular Tachycardia
Attempt vagal maneuvers if feasible (I, B-R).
If vagal maneuvers fail or are contraindicated, first-line pharmacologic options include adenosine (I, B-R) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as verapamil or diltiazem (IIa, B-R).
If short-term AV nodal blockade fails or if the arrhythmia recurs after conversion, sustained AV nodal blockade is indicated with verapamil or diltiazem (IIa, B-R) or beta blockers (IIa, C-LD).
When pharmacologic treatments fail or are contraindicated, synchronized cardioversion is an effective alternative (I, B-NR).
However, if the rhythm is spontaneously terminating and reinitiating, synchronized cardioversion is inappropriate, since the rhythm may simply recur after cardioversion.
Stable Narrow Complex, Irregular Tachycardia
Stable narrow complex irregular tachycardia is usually caused by AF, MAT, or AFl with irregular block.
MAT typically does not induce a sufficiently high ventricular rate to cause hemodynamic compromise and usually does not warrant specific treatment other than that of the underlying cause.
AF and AFl are common and exist on a spectrum of disease that frequently requires acute management in the ED. (See Chapter: Atrial Fibrillation)
As with all tachydysrhythmias, the initial consideration is whether the rhythm is primary or secondary to an underlying cause that can be efficiently addressed.
Important causes of secondary AF include sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeds, ACS, pulmonary embolism, alcohol withdrawal or recent excess, various acute metabolic disorders, and thyrotoxicosis.
If primary AF or AFl is believed to be causing hemodynamic instability, emergency synchronized cardioversion is indicated. 
The management of stable primary AF and AFl typically involves rate vs. rhythm control via pharmacologic vs. electrical therapies.
Stable AF
See Chapter: Atrial Fibrillation
The management of stable primary AF and AFl typically involves rate vs. rhythm control via pharmacologic vs. electrical therapies.
Stable Wide Complex, Regular Tachycardia
Empiric management of stable, regular WCT is more challenging and controversial than its narrow complex equivalent.
The clinician should always consider regular WCT to be VT or hyperkalemia until proven otherwise. If there is a suspicion of hyperkalemia as the cause of the ECG findings, immediate treatment (IV calcium) should be given regardless of patient stability, followed by reassessment of the ECG and laboratory confirmation.
In the absence of concern for hyperkalemia or other toxicologic/metabolic causes of QRS widening, the differential that guides empiric management is VT vs. SVT with aberrancy.
Vagal Maneuvers and Adenosine
Current guidelines do not comment on the use of vagal maneuvers for undifferentiated stable regular WCT.  However, since vagal maneuvers are essentially a physiologic version of adenosine, they may be employed in situations where adenosine is indicated.
As described above, adenosine may be used for both known SVT and undifferentiated regular monomorphic WCT (IIb, B). 
Another smaller retrospective series of 93 patients with undifferentiated wide complex regular tachycardia treated with adenosine documented no adverse events, with a similar conversion rate of 59%. 
Electrical cardioversion
If adenosine fails to convert the rhythm, synchronized cardioversion using procedural sedation with etomidate 0.2−0.3 mg/kg and 150−200 J biphasic is recommended.
Chemical cardioversion
Options include procainamide (IIa, B), amiodarone (IIb, B), and sotalol (IIb, B).  ECG
Patients with stable monomorphic VT can be treated with amiodarone or procainamide; however, most studies of either drug show substantial rates of inefficacy and hypotensive events requiring electrical cardioversion.
Stable Wide Complex, Irregular Tachycardia
Empiric management of stable wide complex irregular tachycardia reflects the most dangerous potential etiologies, including pre-excited AF and PMVT.
For this reason, all AV nodal blocking agents including adenosine and amiodarone are contraindicated in the presence of any irregular or polymorphic rhythm (regardless of stability) due to concern of degeneration of the rhythm into VF (III, C) (III, C-LD). 
Despite this caveat, the most common cause of stable wide complex irregular tachycardia is AF with conduction aberrancy (a condition in which AV nodal blockade is commonly used).
PMVT
Sustained PMVT is almost always unstable and is treated with immediate unsynchronized cardioversion, as if the rhythm were VF. 
Treatment for intermittent or recurrent PMVT depends on the patient’s presentation and the QTc interval during the intermittent sinus rhythm.
A long QTc interval during sinus rhythm between episodes of PMVT constitutes torsade de pointes. Treatment includes discontinuation of all QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte and magnesium repletion, and pharmacologic or electrical overdrive pacing if bradycardia is present.
Patients with a normal QTc interval during sinus rhythm are more likely to have ischemia as the underlying cause of PMVT. ECG Antidysrhythmic infusions may be a bridge to definitive ischemia management.
Pre-excited AF
Pre-excited AF is characterized by irregularly irregular polymorphic WCT with characteristically short R-R intervals, sometimes as short as 200−250 ms.
Sustained stable pre-excited AF should be treated with synchronized cardioversion if procedural sedation can be performed safely.
Otherwise, procainamide (I, C-LD) and ibutilide (I, C-LD) are recommended in this situation. Amiodarone is contraindicated because of its AV nodal blocking properties (III, C-LD). 
Although many case reports exist documenting this rhythm deterioration with AV nodal blockers,  there are also retrospective studies suggesting that harm may not actually be common in this scenario. 
Supraventricular Irregular WCT
The supraventricular origin of a WCT may be diagnosed with classic RBBB/LBBB morphology or by identical morphology compared to a prior known SVT.
The most common etiology is AF with BBB; therefore, diagnosis of a supraventricular origin enables therapy with AV nodal blocking agents.
Nonpharmacologic Treatment of Stable SVT
Vagal Maneuvers
Refers to a group of physical interventions performed with the goal of increasing parasympathetic tone, thereby lengthening the refractory period of the AV node and breaking a reentrant arrhythmia. 
Historically, vagal maneuvers include the Valsalva maneuver, carotid massage, cold water facial immersion, ocular pressure, and many other less-reported techniques. Ocular pressure is no longer recommended due to its potential harm. 
Valsalva maneuver
Refers to a variety of techniques designed to cause vagal stimulation by increasing intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure.
Most versions of the maneuver involve forcing air out against a closed glottis and/or simultaneously bearing down as if in preparation for a bowel movement for 15−30 s, creating an intrathoracic pressure of at least 30−40 mm Hg. (Lim, 1998) 
Many variations and combinations have been described, including supine or Trendelenburg positioning, passive leg raise, and abdominal pressure applied by the operator. 
The 2015 SVT guidelines recommend that the Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage (CSM) be performed in the supine position based on this study and prior observational data (I, B-R). 
Evidence.
Prior to 2015, high-quality clinical evidence of the comparative efficacy of various types of Valsalva maneuvers was limited to 3 small randomized controlled trials, with only 1 study relevant to SVT management in the ED, showing a 28% rate of conversion using a semi-recumbent form of Valsalva maneuver and/or carotid massage. 
Appelboam et al. published the REVERT trial in 2015,  a pragmatic multicenter randomized trial that now constitutes the largest and most methodologically rigorous available evidence supporting the use of the Valsalva maneuver in SVT.  The REVERT postural modification of the Valsalva maneuver is now considered the first-line technique.
A total of 428 adults with stable narrow complex regular tachycardia were randomized to receive either the standard Valsalva maneuver or a modified maneuver. Both groups performed the Valsalva strain maneuver to a target pressure of 40 mm Hg for 15 s while sitting at a 45° angle. Subsequently, the intervention group was made supine with a passive leg raise for 15 s immediately after the strain phase, while nothing further was performed in the control group. The technique was repeated once if unsuccessful. A higher rate of conversion to sinus rhythm at 1 min after intervention was demonstrated in the postural modification group as compared with the control group (43 vs. 17%, P <.0001). No serious adverse events were documented in either group.
Carotid sinus massage (CSM)
CSM is described as “applying steady pressure over the carotid sinus for 5−10 seconds” and is usually performed in the supine position. 
The reported efficacy of CSM to restore sinus rhythm is 13.5−32.4%, depending on the setting and methodology. 
CSM carries a very small but documented risk of stroke, which is believed to be caused by traumatic rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery. Carotid bruit is reported to be unreliable for predicting these events. 
Evidence.
Several large observational studies exist based on thousands of patients undergoing carotid massage as an outpatient work-up for syncope, with rates of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke ranging from 0 to 0.9%. 
Furthermore, a variety of case reports involving CSM for SVT describe complications including TIA/stroke,  cervicomediastinal hematoma causing airway compromise,  non-fatal VF and VT,  and fatal VF. 
Given the low-to-moderate efficacy and rare but potentially devastating harm, we believe CSM should be avoided.  However, CSM is still recommended in both the 2010 ACLS and 2015 SVT guidelines.
Cold water facial immersion
Cold water facial immersion utilizes the human dive reflex and is recommended by the current SVT guidelines. 
Very little data exist documenting the efficacy of this maneuver.
In practice, this technique is generally only used in pediatric patients using a cold pack to the face or forehead, since the Valsalva maneuver is not feasible in this population.
Smith et al. reviewed the available evidence and concluded that the optimal conditions to elicit maximal vagal tone require complete facial immersion or coverage by a cold pack (10°C or colder) for a duration of 30−40 s. 
Several case reports have documented SC fat necrosis as a complication of this technique when used in pediatric patients recurrently or for prolonged periods, leading to recommendations for short applications of cold packs to less fatty areas of the face using a cloth barrier. 
Pharmacologic Treatment of Stable SVT
Adenosine
Adenosine triphosphate inhibits adenylyl cyclase, reducing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and thereby increasing outward potassium flow, which hyperpolarizes cells of the AV node and prevents propagation of the AP.
Adverse events.
Major adverse effects recorded in prospective studies are extremely uncommon but include transient hypotension (0−0.6%).
Conversely, minor and transient adverse effects are very common, ranging from 10 to 75% depending on the criteria used, with most estimates between 10 and 30%. 
These minor side effects generally last <30 s and include nausea, chest tightness, shortness of breath, facial flushing, headache, dizziness, and a sense of impending doom.
The transition from SVT to sinus rhythm is frequently accompanied by transient rhythm disturbances such as PACs, PVCs, and AF. 
Additionally, many case reports have documented rare but potentially serious arrhythmias, including persistent bradycardia or asystole, AF,  pre-excited AF with hemodynamic compromise,  paradoxical increase from 2:1 to 1:1 AV conduction of AFl,  bradycardia with hypotension,  sustained PMVT,  and VF, even in the absence of any accessory pathway or any other structural heart disease.  When administered via IV, adenosine has a rapid onset and an extremely short half-life of 10−20 s or less.
The resulting transient AV nodal blockade can be used diagnostically to uncover hidden atrial activity or therapeutically to terminate reentrant arrhythmias dependent on the AV node.
Evidence: Meta-analyses of high-quality trials demonstrate that the efficacy of adenosine to convert SVT to sinus rhythm is 90-95%. 
Dosing
The guideline-recommended doses of adenosine are 6 mg followed by 12 mg administered into a proximal antecubital vein via rapid IV push followed by immediate flush, classically with the use of a 3-way stopcock. An alternative technique has been described as a rapid push using a single 20-mL syringe containing adenosine added to normal saline.
Although there are case reports describing the safe use of escalating doses, the available data do not support doses greater than 12 mg. 
Dosing adjustments.
Via a central line: Initial adult dose reduced to 3 mg 
Heart transplant: 1-3 mg 
Initial dose should also be lowered in patients taking medications that potentiate adenosine, such as carbamazepine and dipyridamole 
Conversely, adenosine is antagonized by theophylline and caffeine.
Contraindications
Relative contraindications to adenosine include patients also taking verapamil or diltiazem, those with asthma, and the elderly.
Absolute contraindications include irregular or polymorphic rhythms and ventricular pre-excitation.
Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) for SVT
For conversion of PSVT, non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) are an effective and viable alternative to adenosine.
Moreover, these agents may control the ventricular rate in a variety of SVTs, including AF and AFl. (See Chapter: Atrial Fibrillation)
Given their longer duration of action, CCBs (in comparison with adenosine) may prevent recurrence when administered as a prolonged infusion.
Evidence
In a study by Lim et al., infusions of verapamil (1 mg/min up to 20 mg) and diltiazem (2.5 mg/min up to 50 mg) were compared in a randomized trial of 160 patients.  A total of 57% of the patients were converted with a total of 8.0 mg verapamil (8 min) and 17.5 mg (7 min) diltiazem, with one patient in each group experiencing a non-fatal adverse cardiac event.
A meta-analysis of randomized trials by Delaney et al. showed no difference in conversion rates between adenosine and verapamil (90% for both), with more minor transient adverse events among adenosine recipients (17−76% vs. 0−10%) and more hypotension with verapamil (3.6%) than with adenosine (0.6%).  In both groups, a 60% success rate was achieved by using the other agent when the first failed. The average time to conversion was 20 s with adenosine vs. several minutes with verapamil. 
Adverse effects and contraindications.
Verapamil and diltiazem can cause hypotension, which may be attenuated by slow infusion  or pretreatment with calcium gluconate (1-3 g). 
Neither agent should be used in patients with impaired LV function or systolic heart failure, since they are negative inotropes.
If given to patients with VT, CCBs can cause hemodynamic collapse, whereas adenosine is safe. 
Furthermore, CCBs may be dangerous in patients on beta blockade or those with liver failure (as they are hepatically metabolized) or known sick sinus syndrome.
Dosing.
Verapamil
Dosed at 2.5-5 mg IV over 2 min (over 3 min in elderly patients).
A follow-up dose of 5-10 mg (0.15 mg/kg) IV is administered 15-30 min later if the SVT persists and no adverse reaction occurs.  The maximum dose is 20-30 mg.
This may be followed by an infusion of 0.005 mg/kg/min.
Diltiazem
Dosed at 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 min.
A subsequent dose of 0.35 mg/kg IV is administered if no response is seen and no significant drug-induced adverse event occurs.
Beta Blockers
In a randomized trial of esmolol (0.5 mg/kg) vs. diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg), diltiazem terminated PSVT in 16 of 32 patients. The 12 patients who did not respond to esmolol were effectively treated with diltiazem. Both medications were safe. 
No other evidence of beta blockade in SVT was found. Based on this study, diltiazem appears to be superior to esmolol in PSVT.
Cardioversion and Further Therapeutic Considerations for Stable PSVT
Electrical Cardioversion
If stable PSVT does not respond to adenosine or a CCB, electrical cardioversion with appropriate sedation is indicated.
The commonly recommended dose is 50-100 J monophasic or 30-50 J biphasic, but there is evidence that doses above 200 J are safer. 
In the rare case of PSVT that is refractory to adenosine or a CCB, synchronized electrical cardioversion will almost always be effective.
If cardioversion is ultimately ineffective, it is always due to recurrence of the rhythm rather than persistence of the rhythm.
Pharmacologic Cardioversion
Chemical cardioversion with amiodarone is an effective alternative.
Dosing: 150 mg IV infusion over 10 min, followed by 1 mg/min infusion over 6 h and subsequently 0.5 mg/min maintenance over 18 h. 
The major adverse effects of amiodarone in the acute setting are hypotension and bradycardia, which are partly caused by the diluent and can be alleviated by slowing the rate of drug infusion.
Other pharmacologic agents include beta blockers, ibutilide, propafenone, and flecainide.
Overdrive pacing may also be attempted to terminate PSVT (transcutaneous pacing with bursts of 2-10 impulses at least 20-60 bpm faster than the PSVT rhythm). 
The last resort is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which has been used in infants with refractory SVT and hemodynamic compromise. 
Special Circumstances/Populations
Pediatric PSVT
PSVT is the most common dysrhythmia in children. 
It should be suspected in a child with a heart rate over 180 bpm or an infant with a heart rate over 220 bpm.
Young infants may tolerate rates up to 300 bpm asymptomatically.
Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for hemodynamic instability or refractory SVT.
The initial energy dose is 0.5-1 J/kg; subsequent doses can be doubled to a maximum of 2 J/kg.
PSVT in children who are stable is treated similarly to PSVT in adults, and varying success may be obtained with vagal maneuvers, including Valsalva maneuvers or cold water facial immersion. 
Adenosine dosing.
The initial dose of adenosine, which can be used in very young infants, is 0.1 mg/kg. 
Subsequent doses are increased by 0.1 mg/kg to a maximum of 0.3 mg/kg (maximum dose = 12 mg).
In stable patients who do not respond to adenosine, amiodarone may be useful and should be considered in consultation with a pediatric cardiologist. 
Verapamil has developed a reputation as being dangerous in infants, but this danger has been exaggerated. All reported adverse events occurred in children aged <6 wk, while only one child >6 wk with appropriate dosing experienced an adverse event. 
SVT in Pregnancy
The management of tachydysrhythmias in the pregnant patient differs only slightly from that in the nonpregnant patient.
Vagal maneuvers, adenosine, synchronized cardioversion, beta blockers, CCBs, and procainamide are considered safe and acceptable in pregnancy. 
Amiodarone is considered unsafe in pregnancy (class D) due to multiple possible fetal effects and is not recommended unless the dysrhythmia is life-threatening and other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. 
Disposition
VT
The disposition of VTs generally requires admission for reversal of the underlying cause, telemetry, and cardiac consultation.
Ongoing electrical instability in the setting of ACS is an indication for emergency (<2 h) transfer to the catheterization suite according to the 2014 ACC/AHA NSTEMI guidelines and the 2011 European NSTE ACS guidelines. 
SVT
There is limited evidence and no consensus statements regarding disposition for SVT patients.
The decision should be based on the patient’s comorbidities, post-conversion ECG findings, severity of symptoms during the episode, and ability to tolerate the symptoms should they return after discharge.
If the post-conversion ECG reveals evidence of a serious arrhythmia predisposition, such as WPW, HOCM, ARVD, Long QT, or Brugada syndrome, the patient should be treated accordingly and in conjunction with cardiology as early as possible.
If the patient did not experience significant symptomatology during the episode and has no concerning comorbidities and a normal post-conversion ECG, the clinician should consider discharge with close outpatient cardiology follow-up after a short period of observation.
Older patients with comorbidities and evidence of hemodynamic intolerance, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, acute heart failure, or syncope during SVT, likely require admission to telemetry monitoring for further inpatient evaluation.",Tachydysrhythmias
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Place the patient on continuous cardiac monitoring.
Obtain a 12-lead ECG to evaluate for any signs of ischemia.
Obtain diagnostic studies including coagulation studies and chest radiography.
Perform a bedside echocardiography if available and if the provider has the requisite skills to look for signs of acute valvular disease.
Assess for papillary muscle rupture or displacement secondary to myocardial ischemia in patients with acute mitral valve regurgitation (MR).
Consider aortic dissection in patients with acute aortic valve regurgitation (AR).
Start inotropic agents for patients with hypotension/cardiogenic shock.
Treat arrhythmias aggressively with cardioversion if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, or medically if the patient is stable. Follow standard management protocols.
Avoid decreasing preload in patients with aortic stenosis.
Involve Cardiothoracic Surgery early in patients with severe valvular disease.
Consult Interventional Cardiology for possible intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in patients with acute severe mitral regurgitation as a temporizing measure.
Consult Interventional Cardiology for possible valvuloplasty in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are too unstable to undergo a valve replacement.
Start antibiotics early if endocarditis is suspected.
Key Concepts
An acute valvular disorder should be considered in patients who present with cardiogenic shock and/or acute respiratory failure. A history of a recent myocardial infarction can suggest acute valvular dysfunction.
Patients with acute regurgitation will present with pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, and cardiogenic shock. They may also display signs and symptoms consistent with the underlying disease that caused the acute regurgitation.
Consider point-of-care echocardiography to rapidly diagnose acute valve disorders at the bedside, if the provider has the requisite skills to do so.
Consider inotropic agents for patients with cardiogenic shock.
Acute symptomatic valve regurgitation requires emergency surgical repair or replacement. Consult or transfer the patient as soon as clinically and logistically possible.
Patients with acute mitral regurgitation (MR) may benefit from an IABP if surgery is not immediately available.
IABP is contraindicated in patients with aortic regurgitation (AR), as it precipitates regurgitation through the aortic valve.
Patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) will classically present with exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, and syncope.
These patients are preload-dependent and sensitive to brady- and tachydysrhythmias.
Treat dehydration and arrhythmias aggressively.
Avoid preload decreasing drugs.
Acute prosthetic valve dysfunction
Acute prosthetic valve regurgitation will present with heart failure and may progress to cardiogenic shock.
Patients with prosthetic valves who present with hemorrhage require special consideration. The risks and benefits of the discontinuation and possible reversal of oral anticoagulation (OAC) need to be carefully considered.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Acute left-sided valve regurgitation (mitral regurgitation [MR] and aortic regurgitation [AR])
Patients with acute valve regurgitation will present with pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Peripheral edema can also be present.
Acute or subacute myocardial ischemia is often the cause of acute MR.
Consider aortic dissection in unstable patients with acute AR.
Auscultation to detect a new murmur is unlikely to be helpful in the setting of acute MR, as only 50% of patients will have a new murmur. Moreover, it is important to recognize the limitations of auscultation in the ED setting.
Point-of-care echocardiography with color doppler assessment should be used to diagnose acute regurgitation at the bedside.
A regurgitant jet filling >30% of the left atrium (LA) in MR or >30% of the left ventricular outflow tract in AR is diagnostic for moderate to severe MR or AR, and should raise concern for regurgitation as the cause of cardiogenic shock.
Aortic stenosis
The symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) patient presents with exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, and (pre)syncope.
Physical examination will reveal a crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the right upper sternal border and radiates to the neck. The absence of this murmur is concerning, as this may indicate the severe impedance of forward flow.
Bedside echocardiography can assist in the diagnosis of AS.
Prosthetic valve regurgitation
Acute prosthetic valve regurgitation will present with heart failure, and may progress to cardiogenic shock.
Use point-of-care echocardiography to evaluate the prosthetic valve at the bedside.
Evaluate these patients for hemolysis, as severe hemolytic anemia can cause a functional valve stenosis due to high pressure gradients.
Treatment
Acute left-sided valve regurgitation (MR and AR)
Acute MR and AR require emergency surgical valve repair or replacement.
Immediately involve Cardiothoracic Surgery.
Transfer if needed.
Treat the underlying cause of the regurgitation.
For example: broad spectrum antibiotics for endocarditis, percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and surgery for aortic dissection.
Consider using inotropic agents for hypotensive patients.
Patients with MR may benefit from an IABP if surgery is not immediately available.
IABP is contraindicated in AR, as backflow during diastole exacerbates the regurgitation and precipitates decompensation.
Aortic stenosis
Patients with AS are preload-dependent.
Administer intravenous fluids liberally if dehydration is suspected.
Avoid preload-decreasing drugs (eg, vasodilators, diuretics, etc).
Patients with AS are very sensitive to both bradyarrhythmia and tachydysrhythmias.
Treat both aggressively to avoid (further) decompensation.
Patients with decompensated aortic stenosis will benefit from aortic valve replacement, balloon aortic valvuloplasty or transcatether aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
Consult a cardiothoracic surgeon and/or the interventional cardiology service early.
Prosthetic valve regurgitation
Patients with severe symptoms may be candidates for revision surgery.
Consult a cardiothoracic surgeon and/or the interventional cardiology service.
Those who present with symptoms of heart failure should be treated symptomatically with diuretics.
Patients with symptomatic hemolytic anemia will require a blood transfusion.
Hemorrhage and anticoagulation reversal requires special consideration. See the criteria below to determine if the patient would benefit from reversal.
Disposition
Home
Patients with chronic valve disorders may be discharged home if they are hemodynamically stable and have no signs or symptoms of disease progression.
Admission
Patients with acute valve regurgitation require admission.
Cardiorespiratory status will guide bed disposition to either an acute or critical care unit.
Patients with AS or mild to moderate AR or MR who require admission but are hemodynamically stable and have no signs of cardiogenic shock may be admitted to a non-ICU setting.
Patients with an unstable cardiorespiratory status due to acute valvular dysfunction require admission to the ICU.
Those patients who require a valve repair or replacement typically require observation in a cardiothoracic/surgical ICU.",Valvular Disorders
"Deep Dive
Background- Aortic regurgitation (AR)
Epidemiology
The incidence of AR increases with age. The prevalence of AR is 4.9% for mild AR and 0.5% for moderate to severe AR. 
The incidence of acute AR is not well described in the literature. 
Pathophysiology
In acute AR, the regurgitation volume fills the left ventricle (LV), leading to increased LV diastolic pressure that results in both a decrease in forward flow as well as increased left atrial (LA) and pulmonary venous pressure.
Decreased forward flow leads to hypotension and cardiogenic shock.
Increased LA and pulmonary venous pressure leads to the development of pulmonary edema.
This progression is in stark contrast to patients who develop AR chronically. In these latter patients, the LV dilates slowly over time and is able to adapt to changes in pressure.
The pressure and flow changes seen in acute AR are even more profound in patients with a small and non-compliant LV from pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction.
The two most common causes of acute AR are endocarditis and aortic dissection.
Endocarditis leads to AR due to leaflet destruction or periaortic valvular abscess rupture.
Aortic dissection can lead to AR through a variety of mechanisms, including extension of the dissection flap into the valve, involvement of a valve commissure that may result in inadequate leaflet support, dilation of the sinuses leading to incomplete coaptation of the leaflets, and/or prolapse of the dissection flap across the aortic valve, which impedes valve closure.
Other causes of AR include rupture of a congenital fenestrated cusp, rupture of valve leaflets due to blunt or deceleration trauma, or iatrogenic causes (eg, following TAVR or IABP placement).
Background- Aortic stenosis (AS)
Epidemiology
AS is common in the developed world. The incidence of AS increases with age.
Approximately 2% of individuals older than 65 y.
Approximately 10% of those older than 80 y. 
AS does not develop acutely, and is typically slowly progressesive over time.
Pathophysiology
Patients with AS develop symptoms gradually.
This gradual progression leads to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Thickened, hypertrophied muscle decreases the volume of the LV cavity, thereby decreasing end diastolic volume.
Reduced end diastolic volume decreases forward flow, which can ultimately lead to cardiogenic shock and decreased coronary perfusion.
Causes of AS include a congenital bicuspid aortic valve, calcific stenosis, and rheumatic heart disease.
Background- Mitral regurgitation (MR)
Epidemiology
MR affects approximately 1-2.5% of the population.  The exact overall incidence of acute MR has not been described in the literature.
Ischemia-related MR has been described over a broad range of patients, including 11-59% of patients after treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 
Pathophysiology
In acute MR, the regurgitant volume fills the LA, increasing LA pressure and leading to elevated pulmonary vascular pressure and pulmonary edema.
The LV volume is simultaneously decreased due to the regurgitant volume, causing a decrease in forward flow and leading to hypotension and cardiogenic shock.
This progression is in contrast to the patient with chronic MR, in whom changes occur more slowly, giving the LA time to dilate as it accommodates for the changes in volume and pressure.
This dilation occurs up to a point, after which the signs and symptoms of chronic MR develop.
MR may be the result of myocardial ischemia or non-ischemic insults, including myxomatous disease, endocarditis, trauma, rheumatic heart disease, and spontaneous rupture.
Ischemic MR:
MR develops due to the rupture or displacement of a papillary muscle secondary to myocardial ischemia.
Patients are most likely to present with MR immediately following a cardiac ischemic event.
Any of the papillary muscles may be involved depending on the area of ischemia.
ECG findings are not specific for ischemic MR.
Background- Prosthetic valve regurgitation
Epidemiology
The exact incidence of transvalvular regurgitation is unknown.
It is most commonly seen in bioprosthetic valves.
In one registry, 20-50% of patients developed structural valve deterioration at a 15 year follow up. However, the study also included patients with valve stenosis, and the exact number of regurgitation cases was not noted. 
Paravalvular regurgitation is more commonly seen in mechanical valves. Paravalvular regurgitation was diagnosed in 7-17% of patients with mitral mechanical valves, compared with 2-10% of patients with aortic mechanical valves. 
Transvalvular regurgitation occurs across the leaflets of the prosthetic valve, whereas paravalvular regurgitation occurs around the valve apparatus or ring.
Pathophysiology
Mechanical valve regurgitation results from structural valve deterioration (mechanical failure, deterioration), non-structural valve dysfunction (pannus or thrombus) or paravalvular leakage.
Bioprosthetic valve regurgitation can be caused by leaflet deterioration, leaflet calcification, thrombus formation, endocarditis or pannus formation.
Mechanical prosthetic valves are actually designed to permit trace/mild regurgitation to prevent valve thrombosis.
Importantly, trace to mild regurgitation can be seen after valve repair and is considered normal.
Diagnostic Consideration- Aortic regurgitation
Clinical Presentation
Moderate to severe acute AR will present with sudden cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema.
Physical examination findings will include hypotension, pallor, cold extremities, and pulmonary edema. The cardiac apex is usually neither displaced nor hyperdynamic.
Patients will also endorse symptoms consistent with the underlying cause of the acute AR (eg, chest pain and back pain in aortic dissection, fever with endocarditis, etc.).
Patients can present with a new murmur.
The heart sounds typically seen in patients with acute AR include a low-pitched, early diastolic murmur that begins after S2 and a soft or absent S1. A S3 is commonly appreciated.
A soft systolic murmur due to increased volume over the AV may be heard.
The combination of a soft systolic and low-pitched diastolic murmur can produce a “to-and-fro” murmur at the cardiac base.
A new murmur will often be absent or soft due to the small diastolic gradient between the aorta and the LV. 
ECG
There are no specific ECG changes associated with AR.
Patients with acute AR due to aortic dissection can have extension into the right coronary artery and may therefore have ECG changes consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction and/or tamponade.
Radiographic Evaluation
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)
The primary imaging modality used to diagnose acute AR.
Can assess AR severity.
Color doppler reveals a regurgitant jet over the aortic valve.
The jet width, direction and vena contracta width (narrowest segment of the color doppler jet), holosystolic flow reversal in the descending thoracic aorta, pressure half time, and mitral deceleration time can aid in the assessment of the severity of acute AR. EM:RAP Video
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
Indicated in those patients with suspected AR and an inconclusive TTE.
TEE can also be helpful in suspected endocarditis, as vegetations, abscesses, and thrombi are more easily visualized and can be missed on TTE.
The dissection flap and/or aortic root dilation seen in an aortic dissection can also be more easily appreciated with TEE.
Chest X-ray
Will typically show a normal cardiac silhouette with signs of pulmonary edema.
X-ray is not reliable in the diagnosis of an aortic dissection but may reveal a widened mediastinum or an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
CT angiography
Order for patients with a suspected aortic dissection.
Laboratory Evaluation
Elevated (pro) brain natriuretic peptides are non-specific.
Blood cultures should be obtained if endocarditis is suspected.
Troponins should be included for patients with suspected ACS.
Diagnostic Consideration- Aortic stenosis
Clinical Presentation
Patients classically present with syncope, chest pain, and dyspnea.
Symptoms at presentation range from asymptomatic to cardiogenic shock.
A loud, holosystolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur, a loud S2, and a S4 may be appreciated.
ECG
There are no specific ECG changes seen in AS. In some patients, signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or LA enlargement may be seen. LVH in a patient with AS is indicative of more severe tissue damage and is associated with worse outcomes. 
Radiographic Evaluation
TTE is used in the diagnosis of AS.
TTE assessments of leaflet thickness, leaflet calcifications, lack of leaflet mobility as well as peak velocity, peak gradient, main gradient, and pressure half time calculations are used to diagnose and grade the severity of AS.
TEE can be performed if the TTE is inconclusive, and can aid in preoperative planning.
Laboratory Evaluation
There are no specific laboratory tests that help diagnose AS.
Hemolytic anemia is a common complication of AS. Hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are helpful for screening for this condition. 
Elevated (pro) brain natriuretic peptides can be seen in those presenting with cardiogenic shock, but these values are non-specific.
Diagnostic Consideration- Mitral regurgitation
Clinical Presentation
Moderate to severe acute MR will present with sudden pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right-sided heart failure.
Physical examination findings will include hypotension, pallor, cold extremities, pulmonary edema and peripheral edema. The cardiac apex is usually not displaced but can be hyperdynamic.
Approximately 50% of patients with acute MR will not have any murmur. Hence, the absence of a murmur does not exclude acute MR. 
ECG
There are no specific electrocardiographic (ECG) changes seen in MR.
Patients with MR due to ACS will display changes consistent with ischemia or infarction.
Radiographic Evaluation
Echocardiography
TTE will reveal mitral regurgitation.
A regurgitation color doppler jet can be seen going from the LV to the LA. The LA size will most likely be normal in acute MR. A flail leaflet or vegetations can often also be appreciated, if present.
TEE is indicated in those patients with suspected MR and an inconclusive TTE. It can also be helpful in patients with suspected endocarditis, as vegetations, abscesses, and thrombi are more easily visualized with TEE. EM:RAP Video
Exercise echocardiography
May be indicated in patients with ischemic acute MR that is mild to moderate on TTE, as changes may become severe with exercise. Worsening of MR during a stress echo is thought to be secondary to papillary muscle displacement or altered papillary muscle position due to hypokinesis of the ischemic left ventricular wall.
Chest X-ray
Will reveal a normal cardiac silhouette with signs of pulmonary edema, which are normally bilateral. However, pulmonary edema is unilateral in about 9% of patients and is most frequently seen in the right upper lobe. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Troponins should be drawn in patients with suspected ACS.
Blood cultures should be obtained when endocarditis is suspected.
Elevated (pro) brain natriuretic peptides may be found, but this is non-specific.
Diagnostic Consideration- Prosthetic valve issues
Clinical Presentation
Some degree of trace/mild regurgitation can be normal. These patients are asymptomatic.
Patients with significant prosthetic valve regurgitation will present with the signs and symptoms of acute heart failure. Physical examination findings may include pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, elevated jugular venous pressure and, in severe cases, cardiogenic shock.
Changes in prosthetic valve sounds or a new murmur can be heard on auscultation.
Special situations:
Patients with endocarditis may present with a fever.
Valve thromboembolism
Presents with signs of acute regurgitation including heart failure (dyspnea, peripheral edema, pulmonary edema) as well as new thromboembolic events, such as cerebrovascular vascular accident, pulmonary embolism, mesenteric ischemia, and arterial thrombosis to the extremities.
Severe hemolytic anemia
Some degree of hemolysis is normal in patients with a prosthetic valve.
However, severe hemolytic anemia can cause a high-flow state that results in high pressure gradients across the valve, which will cause a state similar to valve stenosis.
These patients will present with signs of congestive heart failure, hemolysis, and cardiogenic shock.
Radiographic Evaluation
Echocardiography
TTE is used to detect regurgitation across the affected valve.
Valve structure, valve motion, LV size, jet width, jet density, jet deceleration rate, diastolic flow reversal (aortic valve), and PISA (mitral valve) can aid in the diagnosis and quantification of regurgitation.
TTE can be limited due to prosthetic acoustic shadowing. 
TEE
Obtain if TTE images are inconclusive or suboptimal.
Can be particularly helpful in the visualization of vegations/abscesses in endocarditis, thrombi, masses or a dehiscence.
TEE is also used for preoperative planning.
A cardiac MRI may be helpful in diagnosing prosthetic valve regurgitation when TTE and TEE are inadequate. 
Chest X-ray
May reveal signs of heart failure such as pulmonary edema, but there are no radiographic findings that are specific to prosthetic valve regurgitation.
Evaluation of the position of the valvular ring or the valve itself can be helpful to determine what type of prosthetic valve the patient has (bioprosthetic versus mechanical), and to identify which valve has been replaced if that information is unavailable.
Laboratory Evaluation
Hemolysis
Patients with both bioprosthetic and mechanical valves will have some degree of hemolysis due to shear stress. This rarely leads to anemia.
If hemolysis and anemia are detected in a patient with a bioprosthetic valve, structural valve deterioration or a paravalvular leak should be suspected, as the shear stress across the prosthesis leads to hemolysis.
Elevated LDH, decreased serum haptoglobin, and an elevated reticulocyte count are seen in patients with significant hemolysis.
Elevated (pro) brain natriuretic peptide can be found in patients who present with heart failure due to prosthetic valve regurgitation, but this is non-specific.
Blood cultures should be obtained when endocarditis is suspected.
Therapeutic Considerations- Aortic regurgitation
The treatment for acute severe AR is emergency surgical valve repair or replacement. 
If untreated, patients with severe AR have a near 100% mortality rate. Hence, aggressive therapy is indicated unless declined by the patient or if intervention is considered futile.
If surgical intervention is not immediately available, patients can be temporized with inotropic medications, preferably dobutamine. 
AR with aortic dissection:
Patients with acute AR due to an aortic dissection require urgent graft replacement of the ascending aorta.
Graft placement alone is often sufficient for restoring normal valve function, thereby making a valve repair or replacement unnecessary.
While usually indicated in patients with an aortic dissection, beta blockade needs to be used with extreme caution in patients with acute AR due to aortic dissection because it can block the compensatory tachycardia that is beneficial for maintaining cardiac output in patients with acute AR.
Endocarditis:
Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.
Antibiotic treatment alone can be sufficient for the treatment of acute AR in some patients, unless there is another indication for acute valve repair or replacement.
An IABP is contraindicated in patients with AR, as the inflation of the balloon worsens the regurgitant flow across the aortic valve during diastole.
Left ventricular assist devices will not be helpful, as regurgitant flow will persist across the aortic valve.
Disposition:
Patients with mild to moderate acute AR who are hemodynamically stable should be closely monitored.
Therapeutic Considerations- Aortic stenosis
Treatment of severe symptomatic AS requires urgent surgical valve repair or replacement.
Balloon valvuloplasty can be considered for patients who are deemed to not be immediate candidates for valve repair or replacement.
If surgical intervention is not immediately available, medical therapy can be considered. 
Patients with AS are very preload-dependent. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is indicated in those patients with suspected hypovolemia.
Preload-decreasing medications are contraindicated in patients with AS. These include diuretics and nitrates.
Vasopressors should be used for patients in cardiogenic shock. Phenylephrine or vasopressin are recommended first-line agents. 
Patients with AS do not tolerate bradycardia or tachycardia well. If bradycardia is present, dobutamine can increase both heart rate and contractility. Tachycardia should be treated with rate-reducing medications (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin), with careful avoidance of bradycardia. 
Therapeutic Considerations- Mitral regurgitation
The treatment for acute severe MR is emergency surgical valve repair or replacement. 
If surgical intervention is delayed, patients can be temporized with medical therapy.
Dobutamine is the preferred inotrope of choice.
Nitrates and diuretics can reduce the filling pressures of patients with symptoms of heart failure. 
Afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside can decrease the degree of mitral regurgitation. 
An IABP can be considered in the treatment of acute MR; this approach is not contraindicated as it is in patients with acute AR. 
Special situations:
ACS
Patients with acute MR due to ACS will benefit from revascularization. This may be sufficient to reverse acute MR, with the exception of MR caused by chordae tendineae/papillary muscle rupture. Consult Interventional Cardiology early for possible left heart catheterization and revascularization if indicated/possible.
Endocarditis (See Chapter: Endocarditis)
Patients with acute MR due to endocarditis require broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment alone can be sufficient for the treatment of acute AR in select patients. Others may require operative intervention.
Disposition
Patients with mild to moderate acute MR who are hemodynamically stable should be admitted to a hospital bed with cardiac monitoring capabilities.
Therapeutic Consideration- Prosthetic valve issues
Treatment options for prosthetic valve regurgitation include close monitoring, medical therapy, and surgical management, which includes revision valve replacement or a transcatether valve-in-valve procedure.
Medical treatment:
Initial therapy should focus on the underlying etiology:
Antibiotics for endocarditis.
Surgery and blood transfusion for severe hemolytic anemia.
Thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulation for prosthetic valve thrombosis. 
Symptomatic treatment is indicated for patients with clinical signs of heart failure.
Employ diuretics for volume overload and ACE inhibitors for afterload reduction.
Patients with acute heart failure from valve regurgitation will likely require definitive surgical repair.
Patients with hemolysis require treatment with iron and folate supplementation, with blood transfusions for symptomatic anemia.
Patients with continued significant hemolysis despite medical therapy should be considered for surgical therapy. 
Surgical treatment with valve replacement is indicated in those with signs of heart failure or intractable hemolysis due to severe mechanical valve regurgitation.
Disposition
Asymptomatic patients with severe regurgitation who are low to intermediate perioperative risk should be considered for valve replacement.
Asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate regurgitation should be conservatively treated and closely monitored by their cardiologist.
Anticoagulation & Bleeding Considerations in Prosthetic Valves
Thromboembolic and anticoagulation-related problems are common in patients with prosthetic valves. These are more common in the first 30 days after valve replacement, and in those patients with subtherapeutic anticoagulation.
Patients with bioprosthetic valves are generally at a lower risk of thromboembolic events compared to those with mechanical valves.
Anticoagulation for mechanical valves:
Current guidelines recommend a long-term vitamin K antagonist, with an INR target of 2.0-3.0.
For patients with both aortic and mitral mechanical valves, an INR target of 2.5-3.5 is recommended.
The addition of an antiplatelet agent such as low-dose aspirin (50-100 mg) is also recommended for patients with a mechanical valve and a low risk of bleeding. 
Anticoagulation for bioprosthetic valves:
Current guidelines recommend a vitamin K antagonist for at least 3 months following mitral valve replacement, with a target INR of 2.0-3.0. After 3 months, aspirin is recommended. 
For patients with a bioprosthetic aortic valve, low-dose aspirin is recommended over the use of a vitamin K antagonist if the patient is in sinus rhythm and there are no other indications for a vitamin K antagonist.
Aspirin plus clopidogrel is recommended for the first 3 months following TAVR. 
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs):
There is currently insufficient data for the use of DOACs following mechanical valve replacement.
There is some data to support the use of DOACs in patients with bioprosthetic valves. 
Bleeding:
Patients with prosthetic valves who present with bleeding require special consideration.
The risks and benefits of the discontinuation and possible reversal of oral anticoagulation need to be carefully considered. Refer to the ACC Guidelines for additional guidance. 
The ACC defines a major bleed as one of the following:
Bleeding at a critical site
Intracranial hemorrhage
Intraocular hemorrhage
Intra- or extra-axial spinal hemorrhage
Pericardial tamponade
Airway bleeding including posterior epistaxis
Hemothorax
Intra-abdominal bleeding
Retroperitoneal bleeding
Intramuscular or intra-articular bleeds
Clinically overt bleeding with a decrease in hemoglobin ≥2 g/dL or requiring the administration of ≥2 units of packed red blood cells. 
In patients with major bleeding, first attempt to control the bleeding.
If the bleeding is stopped, is not life-threatening and is not from a critical site, reversal agents are not needed.
Reversal agents are required when bleeding cannot be controlled, originates from a critical site or is life-threatening. Refer to the 2017 ACC Guidelines for further specific management of reversal agents.  (See: Rapid Access)
For non-major bleeding, it is recommended that OAC be stopped if the patient requires hospitalization because of the bleeding, requires surgical/procedural intervention, or needs a transfusion. If no hospitalization, intervention or transfusion is required, OAC should be continued. 
Restarting OAC:
Delay restarting OAC following major bleeding when:
The bleed originated from a critical site.
The patient is at a high risk of re-bleeding or at risk of death or disability from a re-bleed.
The source of the bleed has not yet been identified.
Surgical or invasive procedures are planned.
The patient does not wish to restart OAC at this time.
Restart OAC if none of the above factors are present.
Discontinue OAC if the patient no longer has an indication for the medication. 
Decisions to stop or restart OAC should be made in conjunction with the patient’s cardiac surgeon and/or cardiologist.",Valvular Disorders
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
When available, consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to bridge to a more definitive therapy.
Utilize pressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine) to avoid hypotension and bridge to a more definitive therapy.
Right heart failure may be worsened by excessive volume resuscitation. Be careful with aggressive fluid boluses.
When available, consider inhaled nitric oxide to bridge to a more definitive therapy.
Administer an anticoagulant:
If thrombolysis is possible, use unfractionated heparin:
80 U/kg IV bolus, followed by 16-18 U/kg/h infusion. Titrate to factor Xa inhibition.
If thrombolysis is not possible, then use fractionated heparin:
Enoxaparin: 1 mg/kg q12h SC
If anticoagulation is contraindicated, consider an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and start anticoagulation when safe.
Thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for massive pulmonary embolism (PE; persistent hypotension lasting >15 min due to large embolic burden). Algorithm
Pharmacologic: IV thrombolysis
Alteplase is FDA approved for PE
>65 kg: 100 mg IV: 10 mg IV push followed by 90 mg over 2 h
<65 kg: adjust to maintain dose at <1.5 mg/kg
Tenecteplase is not FDA approved for PE
Single weight-based IV bolus:
<60 kg: 30 mg
≥60 kg to <70 kg: 35 mg
≥70 kg to <80 kg: 40 mg
≥80 kg to <90 kg: 45 mg
≥90 kg: 50 mg
Check the absolute and relative contraindications Table
Catheter-directed therapy is a promising new approach without sufficient data to demonstrate superiority over IV systemic thrombolysis.
Open thrombectomy:
Thrombectomy is reserved for patients with absolute contraindications to systemic thrombolysis.
Use as rescue after failed systemic thrombolysis.
Call Cardiothoracic Surgery early. Contraindications to open thrombectomy are relative and vary by surgeon.

Hemodynamic Management of Massive PE EM:RAP Video
Key Concepts
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which constitutes deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
DVT and PE often occur concurrently and may be considered similar entities when risk stratifying patients.
The clinical severity of DVT and PE occurs on a spectrum ranging from clinically insignificant to a massive embolism causing obstructive shock and death.
DVT usually initiates in the calf area of the leg and may present with unilateral extremity swelling and diffuse pain.
PE may present with any combination of shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, tachycardia, hypoxia, and hemodynamic compromise.
The diagnostic studies of choice, based on pre-test probability of disease, include
DVT
Low (<10%): D-dimer.
Moderate (11%-49%): Duplex U/S of the affected extremity (3-point adequate). Image
High (>50%): Whole leg or serial duplex U/S of the affected extremity (repeat in 1 wk).
PE
Low (<20%): PE Rule Out Criteria or D-Dimer.
Moderate (21%-40%): CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA).
High (>40%): Empiric heparin, CTPA, and may require additional testing to rule out (D-Dimer, extremity U/S). Algorithm
VTE (both PE and DVT) patients at high risk for serious morbidity and mortality may benefit from pharmacologic or mechanical thrombectomy.
VTE (both PE and DVT) patients at low risk for serious morbidity and mortality may be safely treated as outpatients. Table
Key Diagnostic Elements
History
Consider the presence of risk factors (prior VTE, recent surgery, immobilization, malignancy, oral contraception use/testosterone supplementation).
~80% of patients with acute PE have shortness of breath. 
49% of patients with acute PE have chest pain.
Physical Examination
Only 24%-30% of patients exhibit tachycardia. 
74% of patients have an oxygen saturation (SaO2) <94%.
Diagnostic Tests
D-dimer sensitivity (97%) and specificity (39%).  Use an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in patients aged >50 y.  Calculate as (age in years × 10 mg/L for assay with cutoff of 500 mg/L).
CT angiography sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 98%.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) looking for signs of right heart strain or clot within the right atrium. Only 40%-63% of PEs exhibit right heart strain on TTE.  Image
Treatment
PE - Classify as massive, submassive with right heart strain, or submassive without right heart strain.
Massive PE - Persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) lasting >15 min or a baseline systolic pressure decrease of >40 mm Hg. Evaluate the absolute and relative contraindications for IV thrombolysis.
If no absolute contraindications or a relative contraindication, then
Start unfractionated heparin if no contraindications.
Treat with IV systemic thrombolytics.
If absolute contraindication present, then
Start unfractionated heparin if no contraindications.
Call Cardiothoracic Surgery to evaluate for open thrombectomy.
If the patient is not a candidate for open thrombectomy or IV thrombolysis, then
Start fractionated heparin.
Submassive PE with right ventricular heart strain - Normotensive or intermittent hypotension with both radiographic and biomarker findings of heart strain.
Radiographic findings consistent with right heart strain
CTPA
Right ventricle (RV) > left ventricle (LV)
Reflux of contrast into the IVC or liver
TTE
Dilated Image or hypokinetic RV
Estimated RV systolic pressure of >40 mm Hg
Biomarker findings of right heart strain
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >90 pg/mL or pro BNP >900 pg/mL.
Troponin - Suspected acute elevation greater than lab reported borderline or higher.
Treatment is controversial. Patients with evidence of shock or hemodynamic compromise may benefit from thrombolysis.
Shock index >1
Intermittent hypotension
Lactate >2
SaO2 <92% with distress
Interventions include full-dose systemic thrombolysis, half-dose systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, or anticoagulation alone. Evaluate the risk/benefit due to the degree of shock and presence of contraindications. Expert consultation is advised.
Massive or submassive PE with high bleed risk and absolute contraindication to anticoagulation (eg, recent craniotomy, life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, or other high risk of intracranial hemorrhage), consult with interventional radiologists or cardiologists who are familiar with the use of the FlowTriever (Inari Medical, Irvine, CA) or another appropriate catheter for percutaneous clot aspiration.
Submassive PE without right heart strain - Minor PE.
Determine the patient’s eligibility for outpatient management  based on:
Hestia criteria
PE severity index (PESI) class I or II
Low-risk patients may be started on a direct oral anticoagulant (if no contraindications) and may be safely discharged home with appropriate follow up (14-30 d).
Non-low-risk patients may be started on direct oral anticoagulation or fractionated heparin and admitted to the hospital.
Subsegmental PE
Treatment is controversial. In the absence of co-existing DVT, and in patients without prior VTE, not treating with anticoagulation may be preferred.
DVT Treatment
Anticoagulation:
Direct oral anticoagulant
Unfractionated heparin (malignancies)
Impending venous gangrene (phlegmasia cereulan dolens, phlegmasia alba dolens) is an indication for catheter-directed thrombolysis. Photo 
Do not recommend bed rest following the diagnosis of acute deep venous thromboembolism after the initiation of anticoagulation therapy unless significant medical concerns are present. 
Disposition
Home
Patients with DVT or submassive PE without right heart strain who are at a low risk for adverse events may be started on anticoagulation and discharged home.
Risk stratification may be accomplished with PESI or Hestia criteria.
Admission
Patients with massive PE and at a high risk for hemodynamic collapse should be admitted to the ICU.
Charting Pearls
Testing is dictated by the pretest probability of VTE. Documentation should reflect the presence or absence of risk factors, signs, and symptoms of VTE. Medical decision-making should reinforce the rationale of the chosen work-up.
The decision not to test may be reinforced by clear documentation of the pre-test probability.
If thrombolysis is considered, document discussions of risk versus benefit with the patient and family (if applicable).",Venous Thromboembolism

Background
Epidemiology
VTE includes PE (~1/3) and DVT (~2/3). 
Of the patients with DVT, 40% have PE. 
Of the patients with PE, 70% have DVT.
The VTE total incidence is estimated at 600,000 to 900,000 per year in the U.S. 
10% of in-hospital deaths are due to PE. 
Risk factors for the development of VTE include: 
Odds ratio >10: Spinal cord injury, major surgery, major trauma, hip/knee replacement.
Odds ratio 2-9: Malignancy, hormone replacement therapy, postpartum, previous VTE, thrombophilia, congestive heart failure, central venous access.
Odds ratio <2: Prolonged sitting (car/plane), antepartum, obesity, age >50 y, laparoscopic surgery.
Pathophysiology
DVT occurs when a thrombus forms within the large veins of the extremities. Image
PE is a consequence of DVT and occurs when thrombus partially or completely occludes the pulmonary arterial circulation.
Pulmonary arterial circulation occlusion may lead to 
V/Q mismatch.
Increased pulmonary arterial pressures (via the release of thromboxane and vasoactive metabolites).
Right ventricular dilatation/failure.
Decreased coronary artery perfusion pressures.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The presentation of PE is highly variable.
The most common presenting complaints are dyspnea and tachypnea (81%), chest pain (39%), syncope (22%), hemoptysis (5%), unilateral leg complaints (38%). 
Physical exam findings vary depending on the severity of PE and include tachycardia (24%), crackles (18%), unilateral leg swelling (17%), fever (7%), cyanosis (6%).
The goal of evaluation is to risk stratify via gestalt or a clinical decision tool  each patient into one of three risk categories. The diagnostic evaluation is dictated by the patient’s pretest probability.
The D-dimer cutoff may be age-adjusted for patients >50 y of age.
Age (in years) × 10 = new threshold ng/mL, if the typical threshold is 500 mg/L. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Radiographic evaluation of VTE should be guided by the pretest probability of disease.
The options for evaluation include:
CTPA:
Currently, CTPA is the imaging test of choice for PE.
CTPA allows for the evaluation of PE and alternative etiology to symptoms.
The sensitivity of CTPA depends on the scanner technology generation. Older scanners (4-, 8-, or 16-slice) have a reported sensitivity of 83%, whereas newer scanners have higher sensitivities. 
Patients at high risk for PE (gestalt >40% or Wells >6) may require subsequent studies to rule out PE. Image
Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) scan:
Both the sensitivity (85%) and specificity (93%) are close to those of CTPA.
This approach is less valuable in determining an alternative etiology than CTPA.
V/Q takes longer to complete and requires a patient to obtain the correct positioning and then hold their breath.
V/Q is a good alternative in patients who are pregnant or who have concerns regarding adverse reactions to contrast agents.
Formal catheter-directed angiogram:
Historically, this method was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of PE. This test is now reserved for patients with a high risk for PE in whom V/Q or CTPA is non-diagnostic.
Laboratory Evaluation
D-dimer analysis may help rule out PE and DVT, with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 39%.  The strength of the evidence is highest in patients with a low pretest probability (<20% gestalt or Wells ≤4).
An age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff should be calculated for patients >50 y of age,  as follows: (Age in years × 10 mg/L for assay with a cutoff of 500 mg/L).
Markers for right heart strain:
The biochemical markers for right heart strain include troponin and BNP.
Randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of thrombolytics for submassive PE have used either elevated troponin or elevated BNP in the setting of radiographic evidence of right heart strain. 
Troponin: Elevated due to the inflammatory response triggered by a sudden increase in the pulmonary arterial pressure.
Troponin elevations secondary to PE are independent markers for adverse outcomes in PE (death, long-term pulmonary hypertension). 
BNP: Elevated due to RV stretch.
Either BNP >90 pg/mL or pro BNP >900 pg/mL is associated with increased mortality and long-term complications (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension).
Differentiation of chronic elevations in BNP due to heart failure from an acute PE may be difficult.
Renal function
Required at some institutions prior to IV contrast with CTPA due to the presumed risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
Decreased renal clearance of fractionated heparin and direct oral anticoagulants impact the dosing schedule (frequency and/or dosage) during the treatment of VTE.
Platelet count
Although thrombocytopenia is not an absolute contraindication to thrombolysis in PE, thrombocytopenia increases the risk for bleeding complications.
Thrombophilia evaluation
In general, the thrombophilia evaluation does not alter the treatment decisions or duration of therapy. Given the expensive nature of this testing, there is no indication for routine thrombophilia testing.
Risk Stratification Scores in PE
Clinical gestalt and validated clinical decision rules (Wells, modified Wells, revised Geneva) may be combined with D-dimer to safely exclude VTE, with both having similar sensitivities. 
The PE Rule-out Criteria (PERC) may be used in lieu of a D-dimer in low-risk patients. 
Therapeutic Considerations
VTE treatment is determined by weighing the risk of the adverse effects of the treatment against the severity of the patient’s symptoms and projected long-term morbidity and mortality.
PE:
Mortality and morbidity are predicted by the hemodynamic and pulmonary effects of the clot, rather than the size of the clot. Algorithm
Massive PE - Persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) lasting >15 min or a decrease in the baseline systolic pressure of >40 mm Hg.
The overall 30-d mortality is ~50%. 
Treatment with systemic thrombolysis reduces mortality (odds ratio = 0.45, number needed to treat = 10). 
In patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, consider catheter-directed mechanical thrombectomy versus surgical embolectomy.
Survival rates as high as 96% following surgical embolectomy have been reported. 
Such patients are unstable and often require bridge to a definitive therapy.
Be aware of patient wishes and quality of life.
Consider veno-arterial (VA) ECMO.
Consider inhaled nitric oxide. 
If cardiac arrest occurs, systemic thrombolysis can be considered but is very unlikely to favorably alter the outcome.
Submassive PE with right heart strain - Normotensive or intermittent hypotension with both radiographic and biomarker findings of heart strain.
Definitions range from biomarker elevation, radiographic findings, or both.
Radiographic findings consistent with right heart strain:
CTPA (less sensitive than TTE)
RV > LV
Reflux of contrast into the IVC or liver
TTE:
Dilated or hypokinetic RV
Estimated RV systolic pressure >40 mm Hg
Biomarker findings of right heart strain:
BNP >90 pg/mL or pro BNP >900 pg/mL.
Troponin - Suspected acute elevation above lab-reported borderline or higher.
This cohort contains a wide range of PE severity (from minimal strain to pending hemodynamic collapse).
Treatment is controversial. The most recent long-term data suggest that not all patients with PE and right heart strain benefit from full-dose systemic thrombolysis. 
Patients with evidence of shock or hemodynamic compromise may benefit from thrombolysis.
Shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) >1
Intermittent hypotension
Lactate >2 mM
SaO2 <92% with distress
Interventions include full-dose systemic thrombolysis, half-dose systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, or anticoagulation alone. Further research is required to determine the ideal treatments for submassive PE with right heart strain. Evaluate the risk/benefit due to degree of shock and the presence of contraindications. Expert consult is advised.
Submassive PE without right heart strain - Minor PE.
Determine the patient’s eligibility for outpatient management. 
Both Hestia criteria and PESI have data supporting risk stratification and outpatient management from the ED.
Compared with inpatient management, outpatient management of low-risk patients is associated with similar outcomes (recurrent VTE 0.6%-1.5%, major hemorrhage 0.3%-1.8%, mortality 0.0%-1.6%). 
PESI class I or II:
Low-risk patients may be started on a direct oral anticoagulant (if no contraindications) and safely discharged home with appropriate follow-up (14-30 d).
Non-low-risk patients may be started on direct oral anticoagulation or fractionated heparin and admitted to the hospital.
Subsegmental PE
Treatment is controversial due to a lack of high-quality evidence.
In the absence of co-existing DVT, not treating with anticoagulation may be appropriate. EM:RAP Audio

Do not recommend bed rest following the diagnosis of acute deep venous thromboembolism after the initiation of anticoagulation therapy, unless significant medical concerns are present. 
Compressive stockings do not appear to decrease the risk of postphlebitic syndrome. 
Care of Patients After the Successful Treatment of VTE
The duration of anticoagulation is guided by the risk of recurrent PE. In general, this extends from 3 mo (with temporary VTE risk factors) to lifelong therapy.
Long-term complications include:
PE:
Higher rates of overall morality (including death unrelated to PE directly).
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
Functional recovery (recovery of exercise capacity and resolution of dyspnea) may take up to 1 y. The development of persistent symptoms is related to the severity of PE (right heart strain, elevations in biomarkers, and elevated pulmonary pressures in the intermediate phase following acute PE).

Background
Tracheal intubation is commonly performed in emergency department (ED) patients. As the critical care volume continues to grow in EDs across the United States and worldwide, the number of patients requiring airway management is increasing. From 1997 to 2011, the number of intubations performed in United States hospitals increased by 56%. 
Indications and Special Considerations
Tracheal intubation is required in patients who cannot maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation. In essence, the patient is unable to maintain an adequate oxygen saturation, maintain an adequate blood pH, or protect their airway from collapse or aspiration. Some ED patients may also require intubation to facilitate a work-up for life-threatening conditions, such as a head computed tomography (CT) in a combative patient with a potential head injury.
Oxygenation failure: Intubation for oxygenation failure is typically pursued in patients with hypoxemia refractory to conventional oxygen therapy. While there is no oxygen saturation that defines or accurately identifies refractory hypoxemia in all patients, an oxygen saturation ≤88%-90% despite supplemental oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, humidified high-flow nasal cannula, or non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation is often used in clinical practice.
The decision to intubate for oxygenation failure must also consider the patient’s work of breathing. Consider the following 2 scenarios. Patient A has an oxygen saturation of 90% while receiving supplemental oxygen via at 30 L/min with 60% fraction of inspired O2. Patient A is resting comfortably with a normal respiratory rate and speaking in full sentences. Patient B also has an oxygen saturation of 90% on humidified high-flow nasal cannula at 30 L/min with 60% fraction of inspired O2 but is displaying signs of extremis. Patient B is tachypneic, using accessory muscles, and speaking in truncated sentences. Despite their identical oxygen saturations, Patient A will likely do well with continued management, whereas Patient B will likely benefit from emergency intubation.
Ventilation failure: Intubation for ventilation failure is typically pursued when a patient is unable to maintain an adequate blood pH. This most commonly arises in the setting of acute respiratory acidosis as a complication of reduced respiratory drive (eg, narcotic overdose or brainstem stroke), inadequate neuromuscular strength (eg, myasthenic crisis or Guillain-Barré syndrome), or ventilatory load failure (eg, COPD with acute exacerbation or the inability to adequately compensate for an acute metabolic acidosis). As with oxygenation failure, there is no absolute pH or arterial partial pressure of CO2 that identifies all cases of ventilation failure. However, intubation for ventilation failure should be considered if the following conditions are met: pH ≤7.25, arterial partial pressure of CO2 >50 (in patients without chronic CO2 retention), and increased work of breathing despite the use of humidified high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation.
Airway protection: The decision to perform tracheal intubation for respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia or hypercapnia is made with the aid of directly measurable variables (eg, oxygen saturation, pH, arterial partial pressure of CO2). However, this is not the case with intubation for airway protection, because no clearly defined clinical, radiographic, or lab data exist to guide clinical practice in this context. Intubation for airway protection is typically pursued in patients with a decreased level of consciousness, where it is assumed that depressed mentation will also result in blunting or depression of the reflexes that would normally prevent aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents. Intubation for airway protection is complicated for several reasons.
First, it is commonly assumed that aspiration is always harmful. While it is true that aspiration can result in oxygen desaturation, lower respiratory tract infection, and even progress to ARDS, the current evidence suggests that most aspiration cases will clear spontaneously without requiring antimicrobial therapy.  In fact, up to 50% of healthy patients may routinely aspirate during sleep or other periods of depressed consciousness.  Factors associated with aspiration that may lead to increased morbidity include advanced age, poor dental hygiene, debility, and the presence of chronic organ failure. 
Second, no reliable or reproducible methods are available for predicting aspiration risk. In patients with depressed mentation, attempts to elicit a gag reflex are routinely used as a surrogate to assess their ability to protect the airway. Importantly, the absence of a gag reflex is neither sensitive nor specific for predicting the ability to protect the airway and should not be employed in clinical practice when assessing the need for emergency airway management. The absence of spontaneous or volitional swallowing may be a better indicator of airway protection failure, although high-quality evidence for this association is lacking. 
Finally, while it is often assumed that the presence of an endotracheal tube in the airway creates a functional or anatomic barrier to aspiration, both the placement and presence of tracheal intubation are associated with aspiration. 
When intubation for airway protection is being considered, the decision should include a comprehensive assessment of the risks and benefits of both intubation and mechanical ventilation, expected clinical course, and goals of care. Where clinical equipoise exists, a reasonable approach to airway management may include foregoing intubation in favor of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.
Traditionally, ED intubation has been performed using direct laryngoscope with a Macintosh or Miller laryngoscope blade and rapid sequence intubation medications, with a high success rate. 
Cricothyrotomy is indicated in patients who cannot be intubated using this traditional approach or those who decompensate into a “can’t intubate/can’t oxygenate” scenario. This was required in ~3% of emergency intubations in the late 1980s, which decreased to 1% in the late 1990s, and is <1% today. 
Observational data have shown that patients with difficult airways, defined as requiring more than 2 attempts, are at an increased risk of complications. Mort showed that when >2 attempts were required, the incidence of desaturation increased from 12% to 70% and the risk of aspiration and cardiac arrest increased 10-fold. 
Predicting patients who will be anatomically difficult is challenging, and standard preoperative assessments are difficult to perform in critically ill patients.  Helpful mnemonics for assessing potential anatomic difficulty include:

Observational data from the ED have shown that patients successfully intubated on the first pass have an incidence of adverse events of 14%, which increases to 47% and 64% with 2 and 3 attempts, respectively.  This underscores the importance of first-pass success as the goal for ED intubations.
Some patients experience adverse events despite a first-pass success. These patients typically have physiologic derangements that make them intolerant of apnea, intubation, or the transition to positive-pressure ventilation. This has been termed the “physiologically difficult airway.” 
In the last 15 years, multiple advances in emergency airway management have emerged to enhance the safety of this procedure and improve both first-pass success and rescue oxygenation. Video laryngoscopes have been developed to overcome the difficulty of aligning the axes required to visualize placement of the endotracheal tube. Available in both reusable and disposable versions, most video laryngoscopes are of one of two types:
Hyperangulated:
GlideScope LoPro
CMAC D-blade
King Vision
McGrath X-blade
Traditional geometry:
CMAC
GlideScope DirectView

Randomized controlled trials comparing video laryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy have largely failed to demonstrate the improved first-pass success with video laryngoscopy originally reported in observational studies.  However, several important limitations must be taken into consideration when evaluating these studies, since each trial has specific design characteristics that limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions. In some studies, patients were excluded either directly  or indirectly  for a history of a difficult intubation or anticipated difficult intubation. In the most recent trial, the lack of a stylet may also have influenced outcomes. 
Some certainties can be concluded despite the limitations of existing research: (1) difficult airways are common in the ED, both procedurally and physiologically; (2) difficult airways are hard to predict; and (3) video laryngoscopy is at least as good as direct laryngoscopy and has improved outcomes in difficult airways.
PERSPECTIVES
The authors’ standard practice is to use a traditional geometry video laryngoscope blade as the standard device, with a hyperangulated blade in patients with a predicted anatomic difficulty that can be overcome with video laryngoscopy. These anatomic difficulties include a large tongue or short neck. In patients with contaminated airways, video laryngoscope remains the preferred device. 
Technique
Tracheal intubation requires several steps to ensure a safe transition from spontaneous respiration to invasive mechanical ventilation. These steps include preparation, preoxygenation, physiologic optimization, positioning, laryngoscopy and tube placement, and post-intubation care. Each step adds to the danger of intubation faced by the patient, regardless of any difficulty or lack thereof for the provider. 
Preparation
Preparing for intubation includes the following steps: Preoxygenation, physiologic optimization, difficult airway assessment, development of plans A, B, and C based on the assessment, positioning, pretreatment (if applicable), preparation of drugs for both intubation and post-intubation sedation, assembly of appropriate personnel and provider roles, and proceeding when all the above are completed. 
Preoxygenation
Patients breathing room air can experience critical desaturation (<88%-90%) as quickly as 45 seconds following administration of an induction agent and neuromuscular blocking agent. Preoxygenation is the administration of supplemental oxygen before intubation and is performed to extend the duration of apnea without desaturation. This “safe apnea time” is the theoretical duration following cessation of spontaneous ventilation until critical desaturation occurs. In a healthy, preoxygenated patient, the safe apnea time can be extended to 5-8 min with 100% fraction of inspired O2. However, there is tremendous variability in the safe apnea time from patient to patient. Examples of conditions that can decrease the safe apnea time include infection/inflammation, shock, shunt physiology, anemia, obesity, and pregnancy. In some critically ill patients, critical desaturation may occur almost immediately despite adequate preoxygenation. 
PEARLS
The primary mechanism by which preoxygenation extends the safe apnea time is through denitrogenation of the lungs’ functional residual capacity.
When the patient breathes 100% oxygen, nitrogen in the lungs is “washed out” and replaced with oxygen, thereby increasing the oxygen reservoir available to the body. During periods of apnea, this oxygen reservoir is available to resaturate hemoglobin as it passes through the pulmonary circulation.
Preoxygenation should be performed with high-flow, 100% oxygen. This is best achieved with either a tight-fitting face mask with no air leak (such as those in some non-rebreathing face masks), a non-invasive positive-pressure mask, or a bag-valve mask. Effective alternatives to tight-fitting face masks include regular reservoir-based non-rebreathing masks at flush-rate flow or humidified high-flow nasal cannula.
PEARLS
The target oxygen saturation with preoxygenation is 100%.
In most patients, this can often be achieved with 3 min of regular tidal volume breathing or 8 breaths at full inspiratory and expiratory capacity.
In patients at a low risk of aspiration, gentle mask ventilation with a bag-valve mask and PEEP valve after induction may prolong the time to desaturation. 
In patients with ventilation-perfusion mismatch, the fully denitrogenated oxygen reservoir does not efficiently interface with the pulmonary circulation and reduces the ability to resaturate hemoglobin. This clinically manifests as shunt physiology and a reduced oxygen saturation. In patients with oxygen saturations <95%, improving the ventilation-perfusion mismatch becomes important. This can include using positive-pressure ventilation for preoxygenation with non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, assisted mask ventilation with a bag-valve mask, or mask ventilation after induction. 
If the patient remains hypoxemic despite these best efforts to improve oxygenation, an awake approach should be strongly considered. 
Apneic oxygenation is the application of high-flow oxygen during apnea in order to prolong the safe apnea time. Apneic oxygenation involves continuous oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula into the nasopharynx, which is then drawn into the airway via an oxygen gradient. Data regarding the efficacy of apneic oxygenation are mixed, but the interpretation of these studies is limited by variables such as the efficacy of preoxygenation, the short duration of intubation, and the severity of intrapulmonary shunt. Animal data suggest that apneic oxygenation is effective; however, increases in shunt fraction are accompanied by a decreasing efficacy of this approach. Apneic oxygenation is a cheap (especially when using a standard nasal cannula at 15 L/min), low-risk intervention that should be considered in all emergency intubations. It may be most effective in patients with an unrecognized difficult airway in the absence of shunt physiology.  Patients with refractory hypoxemia are candidates for humidified high-flow nasal cannula for apneic oxygenation if performing rapid sequence intubation or preoxygenation in a patient intubated with an awake approach.
Physiologic Optimization
Physiologic derangements such as hypoxemia, hypotension, severe metabolic acidosis, and right ventricular failure increase the risk of cardiovascular collapse and death during emergency airway management. 
Hypoxemia is the most common intubation-related complication and the most frequent reason for an aborted first intubation attempt.  It is most effectively prevented with aggressive preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation strategies, as described above. However, when hypoxemia does occur during an intubation attempt, it is important to intervene with bag-valve mask ventilation once the oxygen saturation drops below 90%. Appropriate ventilation with a bag-valve mask ideally occurs with 2 providers; one provider secures the mask portion to the patient with a jaw thrust maneuver, while the second compresses the bag. If reoxygenation is not immediately achieved or in the presence of significant shunt physiology, a PEEP valve should be used in addition to a nasal trumpet and oral airway. Extraglottic devices can be helpful for reoxygenation in patients in whom bag-valve mask ventilation is unsuccessful, and may be used in a parallel attempt while preparing for a surgical airway in a “can’t intubate-can’t oxygenate” scenario. Regardless of a bag-valve mask or extraglottic device reoxygenation strategy, in-line end-tidal CO2 capnography should be prepared before induction in order to ensure the adequacy of mask ventilation.
Hypotension: There are multiple ways in which emergency intubation can cause a life-threatening shock state. As detailed below, multiple induction agents can cause hypotension. Additionally, the transition from spontaneous negative-pressure breathing to positive-pressure ventilation can reduce preload and cardiac output.
Common causes of shock, such as hypovolemia, vasoplegia, and cardiomyopathy, often necessitate emergency airway management and predispose the patient to peri-intubation hypotension. In the setting of acute critical illness, peri-intubation hypotension occurs in almost 50% of intubations and is a major risk factor for adverse events, including cardiopulmonary arrest, increased duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, and increased mortality.  Therefore, in patients with acute critical illness and hemodynamic instability, IV fluid resuscitation and vasopressor (norepinephrine preferred) support should often precede airway management.
Some clinicians advocate for half-dose induction agents with or without an increased dose of paralytic (only necessary if using succinylcholine) when intubating shocked patients. It is unclear whether such an approach presupposes that less pre-induction analgosedation or dissociation is required because shock is commonly associated with delirium, or if the sympathomimetic effects of pain are thought to transiently counter-balance the cardiac suppressive effects of the induction agent. Regardless, no evidence exists to support such an approach, and the authors recommend systematically optimizing the hemodynamics prior to emergency airway management, rather than simply reducing the sedative dose.
Unfortunately, peri-intubation hypotension is not limited to patients with obvious critical illness. Even among those without preceding hypotension, post-intubation hypotension occurs in 30% of patients and is associated with increased mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. 
The optimal pre-induction blood pressure target remains unclear, and predicting those who will develop peri-intubation hypotension is difficult. A recent pragmatic trial showed that empiric fluid loading every patient during intubation does not appear to be effective at reducing peri-intubation hypotension rates.  Therefore, the emergency physician must remain vigilant regarding the possibility of hemodynamic deterioration. A pre-intubation assessment of hemodynamics should be performed especially in patients with a shock index >0.8 and patients should be resuscitated accordingly prior to intubation.
In normotensive patients with unexpected post-intubation hypotension, “push-dose pressors” are an option to bridge the hypotensive response to intubation. Table
In at-risk patients or those already hypotensive before intubation, an IV fluid bolus should be given to those that appear to be both volume responsive and volume tolerant based on hemodynamic assessment. In addition, a continuous norepinephrine infusion should be started.
Severe metabolic acidosis: The compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis is alveolar hyperventilation. Severe metabolic acidosis, which frequently occurs with diabetic ketoacidosis, metformin toxicity, or salicylate toxicity, often requires the patient to increase their minute ventilation to >30-40 L/min (normal minute ventilation is 5-8 L/min). Despite such extreme alveolar hyperventilation, many of these patients persist with life-threatening acidemia. Even if a lung-protective ventilatory strategy is abandoned, it may not be possible to achieve a minute ventilation of 30-40 L/min with mechanical ventilation. During rapid sequence intubation, a period of apnea is inevitable, beginning with insertion of the laryngoscope and lasting until the endotracheal tube is placed. Even the briefest of apneic periods can potentiate a precipitous drop in pH, and a recent study showed for apneic periods >60 seconds, pH drops by 0.15 and partial pressure of CO2 increases by 12.5 mm Hg.  Intubation should be avoided whenever possible in patients with severe metabolic acidosis. In these cases, heated, humidified high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation should be considered, because both can improve effective alveolar ventilation while simultaneously off-loading the tremendous work of breathing.
If intubation cannot be avoided, awake intubation may be considered. Here, spontaneous respirations during the procedure are augmented with non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation. Following placement of the endotracheal tube, a support mode of ventilation (eg, pressure support) that allows a patient to set and maintain their own minute ventilation can be used.
Right ventricular failure: A failing right ventricle is exquisitely sensitive to changes in pH, preload, and afterload. Intubation in patients with right ventricular failure (eg, decompensated pulmonary arterial hypertension, submassive or massive pulmonary embolism) should be undertaken with an right ventricle-protective strategy. This includes augmenting the mean arterial pressure above the pulmonary artery pressure to maintain coronary perfusion, reducing right ventricle afterload with pulmonary vasodilators, managing fluids (administration vs. diuresis) depending on etiology (pulmonary embolism vs. decompensated pulmonary arterial hypertension), avoiding prolonged apnea and any period of hypotension. 
Positioning
Proper patient positioning is essential to maximize the chances of successful intubation. The goals of patient positioning are to align the visual axis with the larynx to maximize glottic exposure while also protecting against aspiration. In patients with poor chest wall compliance due to obesity, proper patient positioning may also serve to increase functional residual capacity by offloading excessive weight from the chest wall.
Two positions are frequently recommended for intubations performed outside the operating room: The sniffing position and ramped position. Both have been explored as measures to improve the laryngeal view, and both have been found superior in this regard compared with a neutral position and head extension.  However, these data are limited and neither approach has been shown to be definitively and clinically superior to the other for intubations performed in the ED.
The sniffing position is achieved with the patient in the supine position. The lower C-spine is flexed and the head is elevated, either manually or with pillows or towel rolls, until the ear is level with the sternal notch.
In the ramped position, both the torso and the head are elevated to ≥20°.
A recent multi-center, randomized controlled trial compared the ramped with the sniffing position in critically ill patients in the ICU. It was hypothesized that the ramped position would be superior with respect to oxygenation and first-attempt success. In this study, the ramped position not only failed to improve oxygenation during endotracheal intubation but was also associated with a poorer glottic view and more intubation attempts. 
In practice, the ideal patient position will likely depend on the clinical circumstances, patient anatomy, and disease process. The ideal patient position may necessitate a combination of 2 or more of the above. It is the authors’ practice to employ a combination of the ramped position and the sniffing position. Figure
Extension of the neck may be contraindicated in those at risk for cervical instability (eg, trauma, the elderly, patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis). In these patients, the increased difficulty with laryngoscopy requires a modified plan, such as a combined flexible endoscope/video laryngoscope approach.
Rapid Sequence Intubation
The most common method of intubation utilizes rapid sequence intubation, where a potent sedative is followed immediately by a neuromuscular blocking agent. This method has been shown to improve intubating conditions and is associated with a very high success rate compared with no paralytic administration. With this approach, the worst possible scenario is a patient with an induction dose of sedative who is no longer breathing or maintaining their airway but is not sufficiently relaxed to optimize the view of the airway or perform mask ventilation. Ideal drugs for rapid sequence intubation have a rapid onset of action, similar duration of action between the two drugs, and are hemodynamically neutral. The most commonly used drugs include the following:
Induction Medications Table
Paralytics Table
Sellick maneuver: Although it was once widely used and specifically recommended to prevent aspiration during rapid sequence intubation, direct cricoid compression has not been shown to be superior to sham procedures. Additional evidence suggests it may lead to airway obstruction and difficulty intubating; therefore, this approach is not recommended for rapid sequence intubation.  However, external laryngeal manipulation, where the larynx is moved by external manipulation of the thyroid cartilage while performing laryngoscopy, can improve the view of the airway and facilitate intubation.
Awake Intubation
Awake intubation is preferred in patients predicted to have difficulty with intubation or mask ventilation and in those with severe physiologic derangement. The awake intubation procedure involves several steps: Topical application/pharmacologic facilitation, laryngoscopy, and induction. Patients should receive supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula during the procedure. Additionally, the back-up plan is almost always rapid sequence intubation, and therefore, rapid sequence intubation drugs should be drawn up and the provider should be prepared to quickly transition to rapid sequence intubation with laryngoscopy, extraglottic device placement, or early cricothyrotomy in case of failure or rapid desaturation.
Topical application/pharmacologic facilitation involves topical application to the upper airway and glottic inlet to facilitate manipulation without stimulating the cough or gag reflexes. Although there are many ways to perform this step, the authors prefer the following:
Oropharynx: A dessicant such as glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV should be given at the beginning of preoxygenation to increase lidocaine adsorption to the mucosal surface. The dose of glycopyrrolate may be repeated. Topical application involves atomization of 2%-4% aqueous lidocaine to the soft palate, posterior oropharynx, and epiglottis and laryngeal inlet; 5% lidocaine paste can be placed on a tongue depressor and spread on the posterior one-third of the tongue, which dissolves to anesthetize the tongue, vallecular, and piriform recesses. Intermittent swallowing is allowed, since it promotes further topical application to the soft palate.
Nasopharynx: Atomization of the nasopharynx with 2% aqueous lidocaine followed by 2% lidocaine gel in each nostril will adequately anesthetize the nasopharynx if the nasal route is planned.
Pharmacologic facilitation is unnecessary if topical application is adequate. However, small doses of medications; for example, ketamine 10 mg IV, fentanyl 25-50 µg IV, midazolam 0.5 mg IV, or a dexmedetomidine infusion can be helpful.
Laryngoscopy can be performed with either a rigid laryngoscope in the mouth or flexible endoscope through the mouth or nose. The nasal route is technically less challenging; however, the oral route is preferred, if possible, to limit the risk of accidental extubation or sinusitis in cases of prolonged intubation.
Oral route: If using a rigid laryngoscope, either direct or video, the patient should be positioned in a ramped or semi-upright position. The laryngoscope should be slowly advanced down the tongue and into the vallecula. At this point, we atomize the vocal cords with 2 mL of aqueous lidocaine to allow further passage of the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube is then gently passed through the vocal cords as they open upon inspiration.
When using a flexible endoscope, the patient should be sitting upright facing the operator. We recommend inserting the endoscope over the back of the tongue, visualizing the vocal cords and spraying 1-2 mL 2% lidocaine onto the cords through the endoscope, then withdrawing the scope and letting the patient sit for another minute or two. The scope, with the tube loaded, is inserted into the mouth and advanced over the tongue and into the vocal cords. Special care should be taken to stay off the carina, because the trachea is not anesthetized unless topical application is performed using tools such as the EZ-atomizer. To get into the trachea, the endoscope must follow an S-shaped curve (anteriorly around the base of the tongue and then posteriorly over the arytenoids into the trachea). Thus, advancing the endotracheal tube can be challenging, because the bevel of the tube can “grab” an arytenoid and encounter significant resistance. In this case, withdraw the tube 1 cm, rotate it, and advance again. This can be avoided by using a Parker flex tube, which is curved at the end to fit the scope more snugly.
The procedure can be further enhanced by using an intubating oral airway such as a Berman, Ovassapian, or Williams airway.
Using a combination method can be quite successful in patients who cannot sit upright or have cervical immobility or precautions, or in those with limited flexible endoscopic experience. The rigid laryngoscope is used to control the upper airway soft tissues, and the flexible endoscope is used to guide the endotracheal tube through the cords and into the trachea.
Nasal route: When using the nasopharynx as the route to the airway, the patient should be sitting upright. The nare through which the patient can breathe the best should be chosen. The nasal cavity can be dilated using successive dilations with soft nasal trumpets. The endotracheal tube should be warmed in warm water or between warm blankets to make it more malleable. Blindly insert the lubricated tube straight back in a gentle manner until it “gives way.” At this point, the tube has advanced over the soft palate and turned the corner. If significant resistance is met, stop and withdraw the tube 1 cm and try again. Do not force the tube, because it can be caught at the ostia of the Eustachian tube and cause significant bleeding if forced. Once the tube has turned the corner, insert the flexible endoscope; once the endoscope exits the tube, the vocal cords will be directly visible. Advance the scope through the cords, and advance the tube over it. Ensure the ventilator connector is tightly secured in the tube to prevent it from becoming disconnected and losing the tube in the nasopharynx.
Induction: Once the tube is in the trachea, the patient will likely be coughing, because the trachea is not well anesthetized. At this point, the patient should be put fully to sleep with a rapid-acting sedative such as propofol or etomidate. The syringe is usually ready, and an assistant pushes the bolus when the trachea has been successfully intubated. A neuromuscular blocking agent is not necessary but can be used until the tube is secured. Reconfirm tube placement after induction, and then withdraw the scope and connect the ventilator.
Post-procedural Care
Post-procedural care is just as important as the intubation itself. The priorities after intubation to optimize patient care include post-intubation sedation, ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention, and ventilator management.
The post-intubation sedation strategy should adhere to the Society of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU. The “PADIS” guidelines recommend a systematic, stepwise progression to analgosedation, addressing analgesia first. 
PEARLS
Bolus doses of pain medication, typically a narcotic (eg, fentanyl, hydromorphone, or morphine), are initially given.
If multiple bolus doses of pain medication are unsuccessful in adequately treating pain, a continuous infusion of pain medication is initiated.
If sedation is inadequate despite continuous infusion of pain medication, a sedative medication should be administered (eg, propofol, dexmedetomidine).
PITFALLS
Benzodiazepines are used as a second-line agent, because newer evidence suggests a higher incidence of delirium with midazolam compared with propofol or dexmedetomidine.
If agitation manifests or persists despite continuous infusions of analgesics and sedatives, an antipsychotic (eg, haloperidol, quetiapine) may be used.
PEARLS
Preventative precautions against ventilator-associated pneumonia include elevating the head of the bed, decompressing the stomach with a nasogastric tube, and employing subglottic suction. 
Ventilator management: The goals of ventilator management are quite simple; to achieve and maintain adequate gas exchange while avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury. Unfortunately, the precise goals of oxygenation and ventilation are not entirely clear, although the lung may be injured through numerous mechanisms.
Oxygenation management: The target oxygen saturation during mechanical ventilation is unclear, although 88%-95% may be a reasonable goal for most patients. Oxygen saturations >88% appeared to be well-tolerated in the classic “ARMA” trial, which compared low tidal volume ventilation with usual care.  In contrast, the results of the Oxygen-ICU study suggest that targeting an oxygen saturation >96% may be associated with increased mortality. 
Ventilation management: The target pH during mechanical ventilation is also unclear. There is some evidence, albeit limited, for the use of permissive hypercapnia and targeting a pH ≥7.20. Animal studies have shown hypercapnic acidosis to be beneficial; however, whether hypercapnic acidosis is safe in ventilated humans remains to be fully determined. Data have shown improved outcomes in patients with ARDS, who benefited from a low tidal volume strategy that permitted hypercapnic acidosis. However, it is impossible to know whether the survival benefit, or even the presumed safety, was due to the low tidal volumes or permissive hypercapnia. 
PEARLS
Ventilator priorities focus on avoiding ventilator-associated lung injury. A lung protective tidal volume of 6-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight should be used.
Plateau pressure measurements (goal <30 cm H2O) can be performed with an inspiratory hold maneuver.
An evaluation should be performed for air trapping by assessing the expiratory limb of the flow-time waveform to ensure it returns to baseline before the next breath. Auto-PEEP should be evaluated in patients with asthma or COPD; this can be performed with an expiratory hold maneuver and by assessing the total PEEP.
PEARLS
Extrinsically applied PEEP should be used to reduce the fraction of inspired O2 to <60% and achieve a goal oxygen saturation >90%.
Waveform capnography should be used to check for accidental extubation, because newly intubated patients in the ED often require movements that increase the risk of extubation, such as in the radiology suite and during transfer to a hospital bed or the ICU.
Complications
Complications with tracheal intubation comprise several general categories, including injuries related to the intubation and injuries related to an indwelling endotracheal tube. The most life threatening complications in the ED include desaturation (18%-70%), cardiovascular collapse (10%-40%), and aspiration (1.2%-13%). Some laryngeal injuries have been shown to occur from styleted tube-related trauma on intubation, but most laryngeal injuries are a consequence of an indwelling endotracheal tube, which occurs in 75%-85% of patients. The most common injuries are edema, erythema, and ulcerations. Risk factors for laryngeal injuries include the duration of mechanical ventilation, not using a neuromuscular blocking agent on intubation, a large tube size, a large tube size for the height, high cuff pressures, and a difficult intubation.

Background
Arterial lines (or arterial pressure catheters) can be useful in the management of the critically ill patient.
Arterial lines can provide accurate, minute-to-minute recording of the patient’s blood pressure and allow for repeated blood sampling.
In a prospective comparison of non-invasive and invasive pressure monitoring, non-invasive blood pressure readings showed significant inaccuracy compared with invasive readings (95% confidence interval [CI] of −9 mm Hg to +14 mm Hg). 
Inserting an arterial line is an invasive procedure and risks and complications are associated with insertion.
Indications and Special Considerations
Unstable patient with the need for continuous arterial blood pressure measurements.
Monitoring the use of vasoactive drugs.
Monitoring allows more discrete and accurate measurement of the minute-to-minute changes associated with vasoactive medications than non-invasive blood pressure measurements.
Need for frequent arterial blood gas measurement.
Often in a patient with an unstable respiratory status, where determination of arterial concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide are imperative.
Major neurological insult (eg, head injury, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage).
These pathologies can result in increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
Appropriate management of increased ICP requires the accurate determination of the mean arterial pressure (MAP).
Emergency management of increased ICP often results in rapid changes in blood pressure. Arterial line monitoring assists with blood pressure management in the patient with increased ICP.
Need for functional hemodynamic and cardiac output monitoring.
Pulse pressure variation (PPV), systolic pressure variation (SPV), or pulse contour analysis-stroke volume variation (SVV).
These monitoring approaches can allow the clinician to predict the physiological response to fluid resuscitation.
Such monitoring approaches can be useful when it is not possible to place a pulmonary artery catheter.
Technique
Site Selection
Arterial lines can be placed in one of several sites including the radial, axillary, femoral, or dorsalis pedis arteries.
The brachial artery site should be avoided, because this site carries a higher risk of limb ischemia and compartment syndrome.
Although initial data did not appear to show differences between the readings recorded at these sites, more recent studies demonstrate that the femoral site may provide more accurate measurements than the radial site, especially in patients receiving higher-dose vasoactive medications.
In a prospective observation trial of 24 critically unwell patients on vasoactive medications, radial MAP readings were approximately 4 mm Hg less than femoral MAP readings (95% CI of −12 mm Hg to +4 mm Hg). 
In a comparison of 37 critically unwell patients with septic shock and on vasopressors, radial MAP readings were noted to be approximately 5 mm Hg less than femoral MAP readings (95% CI of −17 mm Hg to +7 mm Hg). 
Radial artery
The radial artery is the most common site because it is easily accessible.
The right radial artery is preferred in the setting of significant aortic pathology or if the patient is on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO).
Femoral artery
This is a viable access site.
The femoral artery often presents a larger target for cannulation than the radial artery.
The femoral artery can provide a safer site for insertion if an arterial line is placed during cardiac arrest, because this artery is far from the head and chest where other procedures are likely being performed.
The femoral artery can be used if the utilization of endovascular resuscitative measures such as VA-ECMO or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta is anticipated.
Due to the size of the introducer sheaths and/or cannulae required for these procedures, it is imperative to cannulate the common femoral artery. Cannulation reduces (but does not eliminate) the risk of vascular site complications, such as pseudoaneurysm or dissection flap formation.
The common femoral artery is the short segment because the iliac artery crosses the inguinal ligament. This artery is reliably accessed 1-2 cm below the midpoint of the inguinal ligament.
Most endovascular procedures require upsizing of the initial arterial catheter over a wire. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the arterial catheter’s internal diameter is sufficient to accommodate a 0.035-inch-diameter wire. To do so, placement of at least an 18-gauge catheter is usually required.
When working with patients who are obese, difficulty may be encountered during femoral artery line placement.
Axillary artery
The axillary artery site offers similar advantages to the femoral artery site in terms of central MAP measurement.
The presence of extensive collateral circulation to the arm minimizes the risk of limb ischemic complications at the axillary artery site.
The axillary artery site may be easier to access than the femoral artery in obese individuals.
The left axillary artery may be preferred to reduce the theoretical risk of cerebral air thromboembolism when placed on the right side (which communicates with the common carotid artery via the brachiocephalic trunk).
Modified Allen Test
When placing a radial arterial line, perform a modified Allen test to assess the appropriateness of circulation.
Elevate the hand.
Occlude both the ulnar and radial arteries by manual pressure for 30 s.
Once the hand has been drained of blood, release the pressure on the ulnar artery. If the hand returns to normal color within 15-20 s, then the ulnar artery supply to the hand is sufficient, and it is safe to proceed with radial artery cannulation.
Note: the Allen test is not universally reliable in predicting the adequacy of blood supply. 
A modified Allen test can also be performed prior to dorsalis pedis cannulation by compressing the dorsalis pedis artery and monitoring the nail bed of the great toe.
U/S Guidance
U/S-guided arterial identification and access is the recommended approach to arterial line placement.
U/S use can reduce the risk of first-attempt failure compared with placement with palpation alone. 
A more recent meta-analysis demonstrated that U/S-guided cannulation first attempt success rates were higher with U/S (odds ratio 2.76) and required the same amount of time as palpation. 
Either transverse or longitudinal views can be utilized for cannulation of the artery. Data regarding the benefit of one view over the other are limited, and such benefits could be due to individual clinician comfort and preference. 
Calibrating (“Zero-ing”) the Arterial Line
To ensure an accurate blood pressure reading, the arterial line must be calibrated. To do so:
Place the transducer at the level of the right atrium (termed the “phlebostatic axis”).
Ensure that the pressure tubing is free of air bubbles.
Using the three-way stopcock distal to the continuous flush device of the pressure tubing, turn the tubing “off” to the patient, and “open” to the atmosphere.
Press “Zero” on the monitor.
Once the monitor registers zero, turn the tubing “off” to the atmosphere and “open” to the patient.
This procedure must be repeated each time the patient’s position is changed.
Post-proceduralCare
Arterial Line Care
Ensure nursing staff have been trained to manage the arterial line.
Care should be taken when samples are drawn from the line to prevent the entrainment of air into the circuit and to minimize the risk of infection.
Documentation
The procedure should be documented in the patient’s medical record.
Documentation should include who witnessed the removal of the catheter wire and an assessment of post-insertion perfusion.
Removal
Assess the patient’s coagulation status prior to removal.
Wear personal protective equipment to prevent accidental body fluid exposure. These items should include non-sterile gloves, eye protection, and a face mask.
Clean the catheter site prior to removal.
Pull the catheter slowly while maintaining pressure over the cannulation site.
Remember that the actual arterial puncture site may be 1-3 cm proximal to the skin puncture site.
Inspect the catheter for signs of damage.
It is possible for part of a damaged catheter to embolize – see Complications below.
Apply direct pressure to the cannulation site using gauze.
For radial and dorsalis pedis arterial puncture, 5 min of pressure is appropriate.
For axillary or femoral arterial puncture, 10-15 min of pressure is appropriate.
These times should be doubled if the patient is coagulopathic.
Assess distal perfusion 15-20 min after removal of the catheter.
Assess the access site for hematoma formation.
Complications
Overall, arterial line complications are infrequent.
Bleeding
This can occur during insertion or from blood sampling.
Approximately 15% of radial arterial lines can be complicated by hematoma formation. In comparison, hematomas complicate femoral arterial line insertion in approximately 6% of patients.
Femoral arterial insertion can cause retroperitoneal hematomas, which are difficult to detect and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.
Thrombosis
Clinically significant thrombosis occurs in <1% of patients. 
Risk factors for thrombosis include arterial vasospasm, low cardiac output states, cannulation of smaller arteries, and prolonged duration of cannulation.
The use of heparin flushes can minimize the risk of thrombosis. 
If heparin is contraindicated, an alternative is to use sodium citrate to flush the catheter.
Infection
Arterial catheters are an under-recognized source of catheter (central line)-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). 
The precise rate is difficult to determine from the literature; however:
Bacteremia and sepsis can complicate 0.4%-5% of insertions
Local infection can occur in 10%-20% of insertions 
Risk factors for infection include:
Not adhering to sterile technique
Long duration of catheterization
Use of a cutdown procedure to place the cannula
Although Lorente and colleagues demonstrated a higher rate of infection due to the use of the femoral arterial site, the recent NEJM 3SITES study12 does not support this finding. Although the 3SITES study was performed using central venous catheters, it is reasonable to extrapolate the results to arterial catheter placement.
Embolization of Air
The accidental injection of air into arterial circulation can embolize to vital organs, and in particular, to the brain.
Arterial system air embolism can be more damaging than venous air embolism, because the arterial system is not filtered by pulmonary circulation.
Right axillary artery cannulation can increase the risk of air embolism.
Symptoms can include altered mental status or a focal neurologic deficit.
If suspected, immediately place the patient on 100% high-flow oxygen. Persistent symptoms warrant consultation with a hyperbaric medicine specialist.
Embolization of Catheter Parts
Catheter part embolization is a rare complication that occurs when the catheter becomes damaged and breaks into smaller parts within the arterial system.
The parts may occlude distal extremity circulation.
Immediate vascular surgical consultation is indicated.
Abnormal Damping Coefficient
A high damping coefficient can lead to reduction in the transmitted waveform.
Causes of underdamping include tachycardia, high cardiac output states, and excess length of the tubing.
Causes of overdamping include air bubbles in the tubing.
Square-wave test
Assesses the damping coefficient.
To perform, briefly open and then close the valve in the continuous flush device to generate a square wave.
The pressure wave then oscillates around the baseline before returning to normal.
Usually, only one oscillation occurs.
With overdamping, no oscillation occurs.
With underdamping, multiple oscillations occur.",Arterial Line Placement

"Deep Dive
Background
Temporary cardiac pacing was first described in the 1950s. 
The effectiveness of TCP as a rapid non-invasive treatment of unstable bradycardia is well established. 
Cardiac pacing restores rhythmic myocardial depolarization at a rate that can sustain a physiologic cardiac output (CO = SV x HR).
Two forms of cardiac pacing are used in the ED: TCP and TVP.
TCP is non-invasive, rapid, and less technically challenging than TVP.
TCP is less likely to capture in patients with obesity, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infiltrative heart disease, or pericardial or pleural effusions.
TCP delivers electrical impulses through the chest wall to the myocardium. In addition to depolarizing myocytes, TCP depolarizes muscles in the vicinity of the pacer pads, resulting in rhythmic chest muscle contractions.
TCP is painful due to the rhythmic sensation of electric shock and involuntary muscle contraction and is not well tolerated by conscious patients.
TCP requires sedative and analgesic medications, which can lead to hypotension and altered sensorium.
Although the only published studies comparing pad placement were conducted with electric models, most prefer the anterior-posterior pad position Photo by postulating that it minimizes transthoracic electrical impedance.  Variables such as chest hair, breast size, and patient immobility may necessitate anterior-lateral pad placement instead.  When in doubt, we recommend positioning pads according to the manufacturer’s images on the pads, as this can minimize delays to pacing.
Because of the relatively higher energy levels required to perform TCP and the resulting involuntary chest wall contractions, a cardiac monitor or ECG cannot reliably demonstrate the underlying cardiac rhythm. Modern portable pulse generators/defibrillators have a mechanism to cancel the noise from the pacer pad and show the pacer spike and the cardiac response.
Pseudopacing occurs when the monitor demonstrates the pacer spikes and what appears to be electric capture at the set pacer rate, but in reality, the myocardium is not contracting at the pacer rate.
The involuntary chest wall contractions will prevent confirmation of mechanical capture if the carotid pulse is checked. Alternatively, bedside echo and pulse oximetry are reliable methods for confirming mechanical capture.
The default setting for most modern portable pulse generator/defibrillator devices is the synchronous mode. Some device types allow the provider to choose between asynchronous and synchronous modes.  The asynchronous mode is needed for overdrive pacing. The synchronous mode is better tolerated and preferred for pacing unstable bradycardia unless the device sensor is malfunctioning and over-sensing.
TCP should only be used as a temporary measure until TVP is established or the etiology of the bradycardia is reversed. Skin burns at the pad sites, hyperkalemia, and rhabdomyolysis can occur with prolonged TCP. 
TVP involves placement of a pacing wire via central venous access into the right ventricle and internal depolarization of the myocardium.
TVP uses a much lower energy (measured in milliamps) and thus does not cause surrounding muscle contraction and is well tolerated by patients.
TVP placement is a skill integral to the practice of emergency medicine.  There are multiple publications describing emergency physician TVP placement. 
Indications and Special Considerations
Indications: Unstable bradycardia
Persistent bradycardia causing hypotension, cardiac chest pain, pulmonary edema, syncope, or altered mental status. 
Most often, the bradycardia is caused by a high-grade (Mobitz 2 or higher) atrioventricular (AV) nodal block, most commonly caused by acute myocardial infarction. 
Overdrive pacing of tachydysrhythmias
Refractory torsades de pointes (not responding to cardioversion or recurring) may be terminated or suppressed with overdrive pacing.  This is best accomplished via TVP because TCP has a lower incidence of capture. The clinician cannot rely on the ECG to determine capture with TCP and therefore cannot assess for resolution of the tachydysrhythmia (the electrical impulses from the pacer overwhelm the lower native heart voltage).
TVP overdrive pacing requires an asynchronous (low-sensitivity) mode with rates of 90-140 beats/min. Once the tachydysrhythmia is controlled, the rate can be reduced to the lowest level capable of suppressing further ectopy. 
In general, metabolic causes of bradycardia (hyperkalemia, hypothermia, acidosis, hypoxia) are less likely to respond to temporary cardiac pacing and are treated by addressing the primary insult.
Hypothermia is a relative contraindication to pacing because the cold myocardium is prone to refractory ventricular fibrillation.  Active rewarming should be the primary goal of resuscitating a hypothermic bradycardic patient.
Toxin-induced bradycardias (beta blocker, digoxin, calcium channel blocker) may respond to pacing.  Attempt pacing in the hemodynamically unstable patient while administering the appropriate antidotes.
U/S guidance for the placement of TVP was first described in the emergency medicine literature in 2000.  This method provides real-time visualization of catheter entry into the right ventricle and confirmation of mechanical capture. 
Technique
TVP Tools
The TVP pacer generator has 3 main controls. Photo
The rate dial sets the desired rate in beats per minute.
The output control sets the amount of electrical current and is measured in milliamps (mA).
The sensitivity dial programs the pacer to recognize the patient’s native cardiac electrical impulses based on the amplitude in millivolts (mV). If the detected intrinsic impulse is larger than the set mV, the pacer will function in a demand mode and withhold pacing. The higher the setting, the lower the sensitivity of the pacer. Ultimately, at very high settings (>10 mV), the pacer functions in asynchronous mode (pacing at a set rate).
Pacing catheter Photo
Rigid catheters without a balloon tip are typically not used in the ED.
Most ED-stocked catheters are 5 Fr flexible catheters with a balloon tip.
The catheter is marked with a hash mark at every 10 cm to denote the location of the tip.
The balloon is inflated with air once the tip of the catheter is past the introducer (20 cm) and helps guide the catheter towards the right ventricle by following the venous return.
The kit comes with a syringe that locks at 0.75-1.5 mL (depending on the manufacturer) to prevent over-inflation.
Most kits have adaptors to accommodate connections to different pacer generator brands.
The negative lead connects to the negative or distal port, and the positive lead connects to the proximal port.
Introducer kit
A 6 Fr central vein introducer accommodates the 5 Fr pacing catheter.
Some kits contain both the catheter and introducer. Alternatively, a separate kit may be needed for each component.
The introducer sheath (resembles an accordion) supplied with the kit allows the provider to manipulate the catheter while keeping it sterile.
TVP Procedure
Connect the patient to a cardiac monitor and the portable pulse generator/defibrillator.
Place the introducer in the right internal jugular vein (preferred) or left subclavian vein.
Turn on the pacer (set rate: 80, sensitivity: low (asynchronous), output: >10 mA).
Connect the pacer box with the extension wire to the pacing catheter (positive to proximal and negative to distal).
Test the balloon to ensure that there is no air leak using the special lockout syringe with a maximum setting of 0.75-1.5 mL (depending on the manufacturer).
Feed the wire through the sterile sheath (resembles an accordion) and then through the introducer.
Advance the catheter to the 20-cm hash mark.
Inflate the balloon and advance the catheter to capture (if available, look for the wire using U/S in the subxiphoid view).
Electrical capture will resemble a pacer spike followed by a wide QRS in a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern. Figure Here, the electrical impulses originate in the right ventricle, and there is a delay in reaching the left ventricle, thus simulating an LBBB.
Mechanical capture is confirmed by manual palpation of the pulse or pulse oximetry demonstrating the set rate. If available, U/S visualization of cardiac contraction can also confirm capture.
Once capture occurs, deflate the balloon and lock the wire.
Decrease output until you lose capture, then set the output to twice that value.
To set the sensing threshold, decrease the rate to 10 beats/min below the patient’s intrinsic rate, and set the sensitivity to the highest setting (decrease the mV). At this point, the pacer is no longer pacing but only sensing (indicated by the sensing light). Decrease the sensitivity (increase the mV) until the pacer starts to fire. Set the sensitivity to a slightly higher value (decrease the mV) than this sensing threshold to ensure that only native QRS complexes (not P-waves or T-waves) suppress the pacemaker.
Connect the distal end of the introducer sheath to the introducer, unravel the introducer sheath, and secure the introducer sheath onto the proximal aspect of the pacing catheter.
Apply a sterile dressing to the introducer site.
Post-procedural Care
If U/S is available, assess for a pneumothorax on the side of the chest on which the introducer was placed.
If U/S is not available, obtain a chest X-ray to assess for pneumothorax and confirm the pacing catheter position.
Obtain an ECG. A left bundle branch pattern following the pacer spikes should be visualized. A right bundle branch pattern may indicate coronary sinus placement or septal perforation.
Contact the appropriate consulting service (cardiology, intensive care, toxicology).
Frequently reassess the patient for a loss of capture.
Complications
The TVP complication rate in the United States is 14-30%. 
The majority of these cases are related to central-line-specific complications and the use of rigid pacing catheters. 
Emergency physicians instructed in the insertion of TVP have success and complication rates similar to their cardiology counterparts.  In the most recent publication evaluating outcomes from a single ED in which emergency physicians placed 5 Fr balloon-tipped bipolar pacers in 43 patients, the success rate was 95%, and there were no immediate or delayed complications. 
Central-line-related complications include pneumothorax, arterial puncture, infection, air embolism, guidewire looping/entrapment, and infection.
Pacing wire-related complications are outlined below.
Ventricular fibrillation can theoretically occur if a pacer spike occurs during a native T-wave. For this reason, it is important to have the defibrillator/pacing pads attached to the patient so that defibrillation can be readily accomplished. In practice, the patient is already connected to a defibrillator during TCP prior to the TVP placement.
Misplacement of the pacing catheter during placement can lead to positioning in the inferior vena cava, coronary sinus of the right atrium, or pulmonary artery, as well as perforation through the myocardium (more likely with rigid catheters). When a pacing catheter is misplaced, it may not successfully pace the heart with an LBBB pattern and/or it may require higher output (mA) levels.
A balloon rupture can cause the rare complication of an arterial air embolism if the patient has a right-to-left shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale.
Displacement of the catheter can result in failure to capture and failure to pace (see below).
There are three categories of TVP malfunction: Failure to capture, failure to pace, and failure to sense.
Failure to capture ECG
During the first two spikes above, normal capture occurs; however, the subsequent pacer spikes are not followed by wide QRS complexes.
The causes of this malfunction include a lack of contact between the catheter and the ventricle wall (reposition catheter), inadequate output (increase output), or the presence of a metabolic derangement such as hyperkalemia (treat the underlying cause).
Failure to pace ECG
During the first two spikes above, normal pacing and capture occur; however, there are no subsequent pacer spikes.
The causes of this malfunction include over-sensing (decrease the sensitivity), a low battery (replace), or a displaced connection or loose lead (reconnect or reposition catheter).
Over-sensing occurs when the sensitivity is too high and P-waves or T-waves are sensed as QRS, resulting in inappropriately withheld pacing.
Failure to sense ECG
In the rhythm strip above, pacer spikes are occurring at set intervals despite the coexistence of native QRS complexes. This is caused by under-sensing. Fortunately, the pacer spikes occurring during the refractory period of native depolarization (pace on a T-wave) in this example are not conducted but do have the potential to induce ventricular fibrillation.
Failure to sense is corrected by increasing the sensitivity (decreasing the mV amplitude required for the pacer to recognize a native QRS).
Pearls and Pitfalls
TVP
Tricuspid valve insufficiency may prevent a pacing wire from entering the right ventricle. In this case, deflate the balloon once near the valve, and twist the wire while advancing until it passes (best performed using U/S guidance). If a high output is required, the pacing catheter tip is likely in the coronary sinus or the pulmonary artery.
If using the left subclavian approach, insert the pacing catheter with the natural curve pointing towards the heart.
The TVP ECG guidance technique described in some textbooks involves connecting the distal (negative) lead of the pacing catheter to the V1 lead of an ECG machine and interpreting the location of the distal end of the catheter based on the PQRS morphology. This technique is not recommended by the authors, as it requires remembering various morphologies of the PQRS during an already complex and stressful procedure. We recommend direct visualization of the catheter tip by U/S while the pacer is in an asynchronous mode with high output.
One case report described the military transport of a patient with failed TCP in whom the team floated a TVP catheter, but because they did not have a pacer box, they used the external pacer/defibrillator by soldering the proximal wire of the pacing catheter to the external wire of the right pacer pad. The minimal output of the pacer/defibrillator was 8 mA, which was more than sufficient to perform TVP during the 8-h transport time. 
TCP
If chest hair prevents good pad contact with skin, the area should be shaved before the pads are applied. Manufacturers do not recommend multiple applications of the same pad.
In stable patients at risk of hemodynamic collapse (such as “stable” type 2 second-degree AV block or complete AV block), it is prudent to have the TCP pads placed and ready to pace when needed. In this scenario, it is wise to test capture by transiently performing TCP.
Sedation for TCP may be limited by the patient’s blood pressure. In cases of hypotension and intolerance of TCP, consider a dissociative dose of ketamine while preparing for TVP.",Cardiac Pacing

Additional pearls based on site selection
Internal jugular ultrasound-guided cannulation
Place the ultrasound probe at the apex of the triangle formed by the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
The internal jugular and carotid artery will be identified as paired anechoic structures. Survey both vessels inferiorly/superiorly to identify irregular anatomy, and identify the ideal cannulation point based on artery/vein orientation.
The internal jugular is generally superficial, lateral, larger, and compressible compared with the carotid artery.
Cannulate the vessel in either the transverse or longitudinal plane.
Internal jugular anatomical cannulation Image
Insert needle at the apex of the triangle formed by the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Use a 30° angle.
Palpate carotid artery during cannulation.
Direct needle towards the ipsilateral nipple.
Subclavian ultrasound-guided cannulation
Place the ultrasound probe inferior to the clavicle in the transverse plane. Begin in the middle-third of the clavicle and scan laterally. Ultrasound access is generally obtained laterally relative to where anatomical-guided cannulation occurs.
The subclavian artery and vein will appear as 2 anechoic structures, with the subclavian vein appearing slightly more superficial and caudal.
The vein will appear larger, compressible, and non-pulsatile.
It is possible to cannulate the vessel in both transverse and longitudinal views.
The transverse axis allows for a cannulation technique similar to that for the ultrasound-guided internal jugular, which will be more familiar for most providers.
The longitudinal axis allows for direct needle tip visualization relative to the pleura at all times.
Subclavian anatomical-guided cannulation Image Photo
Palpate for the deltopectoral groove and suprasternal notch.
The needle should be introduced 2-3 cm inferior to the clavicle in the deltopectoral groove.
Once through the skin, the needle should travel parallel to the floor towards the suprasternal notch.
Use the contralateral hand to provide downward traction on the needle tip to facilitate clearance of the inferior edge of the clavicle.
PEARLS
Successful venous cannulation may require hubbing of the needle and is attained only with slow withdrawal of the needle.
If unsuccessful, withdraw the needle to the superficial skin and change the trajectory of the next attempt to be slightly more toward the head (cephalad).
Femoral ultrasound-guided cannulation
Place ultrasound probe 2-3 cm distal to the inguinal ligament near a palpable femoral pulse.
The femoral artery and vein will be identified as paired anechoic structures. The vein is generally medial to the artery and will be easily compressible and non-pulsatile. The artery may be superior to the vein at certain anatomical locations. Scan up and down the vessel to identify the ideal artery/vein orientation for cannulation.
Femoral line anatomical cannulation
Palpate the femoral artery 2 fingerbreadths underneath the inguinal ligament.
The needle should be introduced 1 cm medial to arterial palpation at a 45° angle, directed towards the patient’s umbilicus.
Depth of insertion before flash is generally 2-3 cm but may vary.
Post-procedure
Confirming Placement
Chest X-ray
Use of chest X-ray allows for direct tip visualization.
Classically, the tip of an internal jugular or subclavian line should be placed in the lower superior vena cava.
It is generally acceptable if the catheter is located anywhere in the superior vena cava or right atrium.
Use of chest X-ray allows for assessment of pneumothorax.
Ultrasound
Confirm that the line is not in the contralateral internal jugular or subclavian vessel.

Background
The placement of a central line is a common procedure in emergency medicine and critical care. Placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) provides definitive venous access and can improve the ability to care for an acutely ill patient. Unstable patients may require urgent central venous access for multiple medication infusions, vasoactive agents, renal replacement therapy, or volume resuscitation. The ability to rapidly obtain vascular access is an essential technical skill for the emergency physician.
The modern Seldinger technique for CVC insertion was developed in 1953. This technique allows the advancement of a large-bore catheter over a wire after a vessel has been percutaneously accessed. 
Historically, CVCs have been placed using anatomically based landmark techniques. The widespread adoption of ultrasound in emergency medicine, critical care, and resuscitation has allowed for increased rates of successful insertion and decreased complications during CVC placement. A recent Cochrane review of internal jugular CVC placement reported decreased complications and an increased overall success rate with the use of ultrasound. 
Poiseuille’s law is a guiding principle of vascular access for volume resuscitation, which states that flow through a tubular structure is proportional to the radius of the tube to the fourth power and inversely proportional to the length. Thus, the ideal catheter for rapid volume infusion has a large bore and short length.
Central line complications are infrequent but can be devastating. Proper care, training, and attentiveness during insertion are required to limit complications. Complications can be mechanical (eg, pneumothorax, hemothorax, hematoma, arterial injury), infectious, and thrombotic. A landmark randomized, controlled trial reported that the subclavian site was associated with the lowest risk of infection or thrombosis but had a slightly higher risk of pneumothorax than the internal jugular or femoral sites.  The devastating complication of air embolism can also occur with CVC insertion.
Indications
Inability to obtain peripheral vascular access
Risk factors for difficult peripheral IV catheter access include IV drug use, diabetes, and sickle cell disease. Interestingly, obesity, dialysis, and chemotherapy have not been found to be predictors of difficult peripheral IV catheter access. 
If peripheral IV catheter access cannot be obtained and immediate CVC placement is not feasible, consider an alternative means of vascular access, such as an intraosseous (IO) line.  An (IO) line can be placed faster than a peripheral IV catheter during cardiac arrest.  First-attempt success is higher with an intraosseous catheter than with a peripheral IV catheter. 
The femoral and subclavian veins can be reliably cannulated with a CVC in a timely manner.  The femoral vein site provides the fastest time to CVC placement compared with the subclavian and internal jugular vein sites.
The femoral vein is a common site for CVC placement during cardiac arrest resuscitation, as it is spatially separated from chest compressions and the airway.
PERSPECTIVES
Groin pulsations may be venous rather than arterial.  Therefore, the use of ultrasound may ensure proper placement.
Hemodynamic monitoring
Central Venous Pressure (CVP)
Represents the pressure of blood against the walls of the venae cavae. While it has traditionally been used to guide fluid resuscitation in sepsis, 
PEARLS
CVP has been shown to be a poor indicator of volume responsiveness. 
At very low and very high values, it may be useful for guiding fluid therapy in concert with other clinical data.
Low: <8 cm H2O
Normal: 8-12 cm H2O
High: >12 cm H2O
Central Venous Oxygen Saturation
Can be a useful marker of oxygen delivery and extraction. Generally, it correlates with the mixed venous oxygen saturation measured in the pulmonary artery via a pulmonary artery catheter. The difference between central and mixed venous oxygen saturation readings is due to deoxygenated blood coming from the heart via the Thebesian veins (draining directly into the right atrium) versus blood from the abdomen and lower extremities (draining from the inferior vena cava). Conditions that exacerbate differences in oxygen extraction, such as increased myocardial oxygen, can widen the difference between central venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation. 
Central venous oxygen saturation is measured from a CVC placed in the internal jugular or subclavian vein with the distal tip positioned at the cavoatrial junction. This measures the oxygen saturation in the blood returning from the upper body. Central venous oxygen saturation may also be measured from a peripherally inserted central catheter line, port, or other indwelling CVC, as long as the tip of the catheter is positioned at the cavoatrial junction.
Interpretation of central venous oxygen saturation:
Normal central venous oxygen saturation: 65%-75%.
Values <65% indicate decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
Reduced cardiac output (due to low preload, high afterload, impaired contractility, or chronotropic insufficiency).
Values >80% indicate decreased oxygen extraction.
Increased cardiac output, high-flow state (eg sepsis, hyperthyroidism, liver failure)
Impaired tissue oxygen extraction, often due to cellular or mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis.
PEARLS
Routine measurements of CVP and central venous oxygen saturation to guide resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have not been found to improve mortality. In specific circumstances, clinical judgment may be applied regarding these measurements. 
Pulmonary Artery Catheter
Requires placement of the introducer sheath in the left subclavian or right internal jugular vein.
Provides measurements for multiple hemodynamic parameters, including CVP/right atrial pressure, right ventricular pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac output. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance may also be calculated.
PEARLS
Several large intensive care unit (ICU)-based trials have demonstrated no improvement in mortality and possible harm with the routine use of pulmonary artery catheters to guide therapy for patients with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
Administration of medications
CVCs allow for safer infusion of medications that can cause tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs at peripheral sites.  Some types of parenteral nutrition also require a CVC.
PEARLS
Vasopressor agents can be run safely through a peripheral IV catheter (18- or 20-gauge IV in the antecubital fossa or a more proximal IV) for ≤4 h.
Some data suggest that vasopressors can be infused for a significantly longer time in peripheral IVs if placed in a vein that is >4 mm, contralateral to a non-invasive blood pressure (BP) cuff, and confirmed with blood return every 2 h. 
PEARLS
Hypertonic saline can be safely administered through a peripheral IV in the setting of treatment for severe hyponatremia, traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or signs of impending herniation. 
Calcium chloride has an elemental calcium concentration 3-fold greater than that of calcium gluconate; in addition, it has increased bioavailability and is often available in crash carts. Calcium chloride is the preferred agent in cardiac arrest or peri-arrest patients. If a central line is not present, calcium chloride may be administered through a peripheral IV catheter.  Some data suggest that peripheral administration of compounded calcium chloride in 5% dextrose is associated with a low incidence of infusion site reactions during calcium gluconate drug shortages. 
Large-volume resuscitation
Adequate access for volume resuscitation is generally provided by two 18-gauge or larger peripheral IV catheters. An 18-gauge peripheral IV has a flow rate of 153 mL/min when 0.9% saline is delivered with a pressure bag at 300 mm Hg, which is slower than an 8.5-Fr introducer sheath (189 mL/min) but faster than the distal port of a triple-lumen catheter (63-116 mL/min). If adequate peripheral IV access is present, the patient may not require urgent central access. 
Flow rates of 0.9% saline delivered via gravity:
14-gauge peripheral IV catheter: 142-236 mL/min
16-gauge peripheral IV catheter: 131-154 mL/min
18-gauge peripheral IV catheter: 98 mL/min
Triple lumen
Distal port: 50-69 mL/min
If using all 3 ports: 114 mL/min
8.5-Fr introducer: 161 mL/min
Flow rates of 0.9% saline delivered via pressure bag at 300 mm Hg:
14-gauge peripheral IV catheter: 165-384 mL/min
16-gauge peripheral IV catheter: 155-334 mL/min
18-gauge peripheral IV catheter: 153 mL/min
Triple lumen
Distal port: 63-116 mL/min
If using all 3 ports: 145 mL/min
8.5-Fr introducer: 189 mL/min
Flow rates of saline using a rapid infusion system 
14-gauge: 799 mL/min
16-gauge: 524 mL/min
18-gauge: 263 mL/min
7.0-Fr rapid infusion catheter: 1,137 mL/min
8.5-Fr rapid infusion catheter: 1,200 mL/min
Double-lumen central line, 14-gauge: 277 mL/min
Multi-lumen access catheter
12-gauge: 337 mL/min
11.2-gauge: 1,200 mL/min
8.5-Fr introducer sheath: 1,156 mL/min
Transvenous pacing (See Chapter: Cardiac Pacing)
Requires an introducer sheath, preferably in the right internal jugular or left subclavian.
Many transvenous pacing kits come with an introducer sheath.
Endovascular temperature management
Commercial products are available that include a CVC with channels in which temperature-regulated fluid is circulated or with coils that are heated or cooled.
These are associated with a decreased induction time to targeted temperature and improved maintenance of target pressure. 
Extracorporeal life support
Frequent blood draws
Emergency or urgent renal replacement therapy
A temporary dialysis CVC may be placed percutaneously and used for emergency hemodialysis if a tunnelled catheter cannot be urgently placed or if the patient does not have a fistula or graft. 
Femoral and internal jugular dialysis catheters have similar rates of infection; however, the internal jugular vein site is associated with a higher mechanical complication rate. 
Special Considerations
Site Considerations
Subclavian
The right side of the chest has a lower pleural apex and is traditionally thought to have a lower risk of pneumothorax. However, right-sided CVC placement has higher rates of catheter malposition and vascular injury. 
Pneumothorax risk is 0.45%-3.1%  among experienced operators.
PEARLS
The subclavian site carries the lowest risk of catheter bacterial colonization and catheter-associated infections (0.5%) among all 3 sites. 
The subclavian site has a decreased risk of thrombosis compared with internal jugular and femoral sites, with a 0.5% risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism.
Ultrasound-guided subclavian catheterization results in decreased complications, including pneumothorax, and increased success rates. 
A randomized controlled trial involving 1,484 patients demonstrated that ultrasound-guided subclavian catheterization did not cause a significant difference in mechanical complications compared with ultrasound-guided internal jugular placement. The occurrence of pneumothorax for the former in this study was 0.1%. 
Femoral
A recent study found the following overall complication rates for femoral CVCs. 
1.2% infection risk
1.4% risk of thrombosis
0.7% risk of significant mechanical injury such as arterial injury or hematoma
A 2012 meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in catheter-associated bloodstream infection compared with internal jugular and subclavian sites. These findings were discordant with the results of a randomized controlled trial by Parienti and colleagues.  A 2017 meta-analysis found that the femoral site was associated with an increased risk of infection compared to other sites. 
It is important to note that femoral lines are more frequently placed urgently or in patients with difficult vascular access. 
For short-term central access (up to 4 d), the risk of infection was equivalent between femoral and internal jugular. 
The femoral site requires more intense care for cleaning compared with subclavian and internal jugular sites.
Internal Jugular
Based on a recent study, the overall complication rates for internal jugular CVCs are: 
1.4% infection risk
0.9% risk of symptomatic thrombosis
1.4% risk of significant mechanical complications, such as pneumothorax or arterial injury
0.2% risk of pneumothorax, <0.1% when ultrasound is used. 
PITFALLS
Prone to collapse with respiratory variation, which may cause cannulation difficulty in hypotensive patients. 
The internal jugular site should be avoided in patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) because of concern for venous obstruction during the procedure and worsening cerebrovascular compliance.  Due to postural changes and ICP, head of bed elevation is a preferred measure to reduce ICP when placing an internal jugular CVC.  Placing the patient in Trendelenburg could be detrimental to cerebral venous drainage.
Coagulopathy
Patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, medication-induced coagulopathy, platelet dysfunction, or liver disease may need central access. Central vein cannulation in patients who are at increased risk for bleeding can create a difficult situation for the resuscitationist. The incidence of major bleeding in anticoagulated patients is low. 
Femoral or internal jugular sites are preferred over the subclavian site in coagulopathic patients, as they are externally compressible. The risks of internal jugular placement in severely coagulopathic patients should be weighed against the risk of neck hematoma, which can compromise the airway. Femoral cannulation should occur below the inguinal ligament to reduce the risk of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The subclavian site does not allow for direct compression.
To limit the risk of vascular trauma, ultrasound guidance is preferred because it is associated with fewer vascular injuries. 
A recent review article noted that lab indices of coagulopathy do not correlate with bleeding risk.  Correction of platelet, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) values before CVC insertion remains controversial. Carino and colleagues recommend that prophylactic plasma not be used for an INR <3.0 and selectively used for higher INRs.  Further study is required to determine the minimum number of platelets and the maximum prothrombin time, PTT, and INR values for safe CVC insertion.
The complication rates of CVC insertion in coagulopathic patients are more closely associated with provider experience than with hemostasis abnormalities. 
Consider a micropuncture kit to reduce complications in these patients. 
Alternative Vascular Access Techniques
PEARLS
Intraosseous access may be used as a substitute in critically ill patients with shock, cardiac arrest, or difficult access.
In patients requiring immediate access for volume administration as well as vasoactive or critical medications, IO placement is faster, with a higher first-attempt success rate than CVC insertion or ultrasound-guided IV placement. 
The intraosseous flow rate may reach up to 150 mL/min in either the tibial or humeral route when the pressure bag is inflated up to 300 mm Hg. 
Ultrasound-guided peripheral IV catheters may be appropriate, especially in stable patients with difficult IV access due to factors such as previous IV drug use, end-stage renal disease, or sickle cell disease. 
Ultrasound-guided peripheral IV catheters were historically believed to have high failure rates; however, one study found that 7 of every 8 patients admitted to an inpatient service with an ultrasound-guided IV did not require CVC placement. Those that did require CVC placement were associated with an increased length of stay and a higher ICU admission rate. 
PEARLS
Factors associated with successful placement of ultrasound-guided peripheral IV catheters include a shallow (<2 cm) large-diameter vessel, as well as utilization of a long angiocatheter. 
CVC Substitutes
Rapid infusion catheter
The rapid infusion catheter is a device used to convert a small-bore peripheral IV catheter of 20 gauge or greater into a large-bore catheter (7 Fr or 8.5 Fr) via the Seldinger technique. This device has an 8.5-Fr diameter and is 6.5 cm long, much shorter than a Cordis introducer sheath.
PEARLS
In a 2017 study, the rapid infusion catheter outperformed all evaluated catheters, including an 8.5-Fr introducer, 14-gauge peripheral IV, and hemodialysis line, obtaining a flow rate of 1,200 mL/min with the use of a rapid infusion device. 
Rapid infusion catheters have been used with success in trauma resuscitations in both military and civilian settings, in pediatrics, and intraoperatively. 
Advantages of rapid infusion catheters over central lines include speed of placement, high flow rate, and lack of central line-associated complications. As the rapid infusion catheter is placed in the peripheral vein of an extremity, the rest of the patient's body is free for other procedures during a resuscitation.
Complications include loss of access from a previous peripheral IV catheter, hematoma, thrombophlebitis, and infection. Compartment syndrome can develop if infiltration and extravasation occur under high pressure. 
Steps for placement:
Place a peripheral IV 20 gauge or larger in a relatively straight, large-diameter vein (preferably in the antecubital fossa). Other locations, such as the forearm or saphenous, may be acceptable if the vein is straight for ≥5 cm.
Clean the previous venipuncture site with chlorhexidine.
Insert the guidewire into the existing cannula.
Remove the peripheral IV catheter.
Use a scalpel (preferably size #11) to make a small incision of approximately 5 mm over the wire.
Advance the sheath and dilator over the wire into the vessel.
Remove the dilator and guidewire together, leaving the sheath in the vessel.
Midline and short midline:
Another alternative route of venous access is the placement of a midline or “short” midline catheter. These catheters are placed in a peripheral vein and are longer than a standard angiocatheter. Standard midlines are 15-25 cm, whereas a short midline may be 6-15 cm. They are generally placed under ultrasound guidance via the Seldinger technique.
PERSPECTIVES
One advantage over ultrasound-guided peripheral IV catheters is improved longevity, as a longer catheter may be more difficult to dislodge. There may also be a higher rate of successful placement using the Seldinger technique. Scoppettuolo and colleagues demonstrated 100% placement success in a retrospective analysis of 76 patients, with a mean replacement time of 9.5 min. 
Advantages over central lines include decreased cost and the avoidance of central line-associated complications. 
Vasopressor administration through midlines was previously considered similar to that for a peripheral IV; however, the former have lower rates of infiltration. No data exist to support long-term vasopressor use in midlines compared with central lines.

20 cm Midline Tutorial Video
Easy (rapid) Internal Jugular (“easy IJ”)
The “easy IJ” is a rapid option for patients in whom IV access is difficult.
Moayedi and colleagues demonstrated this technique to be a safe, rapid alternative to CVC placement for emergency patients who require short-term access. An 88% success rate was achieved in 74 patients, with an average placement time of 4.4 min. There were no cases of arterial puncture, pneumothorax, or line infection. Loss of IV patency occurred in 14%.  In a separate study, this “easy IJ” was placed successfully in 34 of 35 patients with a mean placement time of 3.1 min, with no instances of arterial puncture, pneumothorax, or infection. 
In one study, post-procedural imaging demonstrated that a safety margin >2 cm between the catheter and pleura was not consistently maintained. Ultrasound or chest X-ray imaging should be considered to rule out pneumothorax after placement. 
An 18-gauge “easy IJ” (or larger) may be converted to a central line via the Seldinger technique if the patient requires improved access. 
PITFALLS
More research is required to establish guidelines for placement duration and infection risk for the “easy IJ.” For now, it should be assumed that the risk is comparable to that of a CVC, and full sterile precautions should be used.
Steps for placement:
Clean skin with alcohol swab or chlorhexidine prep.
Use ultrasound to visualize the internal jugular.
Sterile ultrasound probe cover and full sterile barrier precautions are recommended.
Cannulate vessel using an 18-gauge angiocatheter or peripheral IV catheter.

Upsizing peripheral IV technique
PEARLS
If large-bore peripheral access is desired in a hypotensive patient for whom a sufficiently large vein is not identified, a small distal IV may be placed in the hand while leaving the tourniquet on and infusing 50-100 mL of crystalloid IV against the tourniquet. This may distend the vein and allow cannulation with a larger-bore catheter.
Two studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique. Harvey and colleagues demonstrated success using this technique in 19 of 20 adult patients with hypovolemia, systolic BP <100 mm Hg, and heart rate >100, with a median of a 20- to 16-gauge IV. Similarly, Quin and Sheik demonstrated a 68% success rate in patients with otherwise failed peripheral access during hypovolemic shock. 
PERSPECTIVES
Based on limited existing data, this technique appears to be safe, requires no additional equipment, and may be applied in both hospital and prehospital settings.
Steps for placement:
Place a 20- to 24-gauge IV in a distal extremity such as the hand. Do not remove the tourniquet.
Infuse 50-100 mL of IV fluid with either multiple normal saline flushes or using a bag of isotonic crystalloid under pressure, with the tourniquet still in place. This will distend the vessel, allowing better proximal visualization.
Cannulate the now-distended vessel with a larger-bore 14- to 18-gauge peripheral IV catheter, proximal to the previous site.

Ultrasound needle tip visualization
PERSPECTIVES
If cannulating in the transverse plane, two motions with the ultrasound probe should be performed: fanning and sliding.
Fanning should be used to optimize needle visualization. Based on the principle of the angle of insonation, a 90° angle between the ultrasound probe and needle should facilitate optimal visualization. The scanning hand should be dynamic; sliding should be used to ensure that the needle tip is constantly in view as it passes through skin and soft tissue and approaches and enters the vessel. As the needle tip moves past the ultrasound field of view, slide the ultrasound probe distally to keep the needle tip in view.
In the longitudinal plane, stabilize the ultrasound probe and advance the needle to ensure that the needle is constantly in view. Slide laterally in both directions to ensure that the visualized vessel is maximal in diameter; this ensures that the center of the vessel is being cannulated. If the needle is lost from view, stop advancing and find the needle by sliding the ultrasound probe.

Use the “withdraw and clamp” technique. Withdraw the plastic sheath 3-5 cm, clamp down on the wire with the thumb, and then advance the wire-sheet apparatus together to feed the wire into the vessel.
The wire should be fed at an angle roughly parallel to the vessel.

Internal Jugular Incision Photo
Microskill 5 dilation Photo
Skin incision and dilation
Make an incision with a scalpel (preferably #11) by sliding the blunt edge of the portion over the wire and in to puncture the skin, taking care to avoid cutting the wire. The exact size of the incision depends on the catheter but is generally 0.5-1.5 cm; the incision only punctures the skin.
Rotate the wire around the incision to ensure that there is no skin bridge.
Dilation should occur at an angle roughly parallel to the vessel.
Grip the back of the wire just as it exits the dilator.
Slide the wire back and forth while dilating to ensure that it feeds easily and that the wire is not kinked.
Grip the dilator with the opposite hand 2 cm from skin. Push and twist gently until pressure is felt. Slide the wire back and forth to ensure that it is not kinked each time pressure is felt.
Twist and pull technique:
Insert dilator in a straight manner until pressure is felt.
Slide the wire to ensure that it is not kinked.
Twist the dilator for 2-3 rotations, and then retract the dilator to break the soft tissue.
Reinsert dilator and repeat the above steps.
Additional considerations
Ultrasound-guided internal jugular cannulation
Longitudinal
Ultrasound Internal Jugular longitudinal Image
The longitudinal axis allows for in-plane needle visualization, but the carotid artery cannot be visualized.
Similar success and complication rates have been noted in studies comparing the longitudinal and transverse approaches.  Some evidence indicates increased first-pass success with the transverse view, with improved needle tip visualization in the longitudinal view. 
Transverse
Ultrasound Internal Jugular transverse Image
Oblique approach
Ultrasound Internal Jugular oblique Image
The oblique view is found halfway between the transverse and longitudinal views of the internal jugular at approximately 45° to the vessel.
Allows for the needle to be placed in-plane with the ultrasound probe for improved needle visualization and direct visualization of the carotid artery.
No significant decrease in the rate of posterior wall rupture has been found between oblique and transverse views, and no significant difference in complications or first-past success has been found compared with transverse and longitudinal attempts. 
Subclavian ultrasound-guided cannulation
Longitudinal
Ultrasound subclavian longitudinal Image
Transverse
Ultrasound subclavian transverse Image
Avoid the pleura by directing the needle towards the subclavian vein to the point at which it intersects with the second rib, thereby providing a physical barrier between the needle tip and the pleura. This technique may also provide increased compressibility in the event of vascular injury. 
Short-axis cannulation has been found to provide higher success rates and a decreased risk of arterial injury compared with the long-axis approach. 
Shrugging the ipsilateral shoulder can open up the window, allowing more of the subclavian vein to be visible on ultrasound by reducing overlap with the clavicle. 
See: https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/shrug-subclavian/.
Supraclavicular anatomic cannulation
Identify the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid.
Insert the needle tip 1 cm lateral to the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and 1 cm posterior to the clavicle.
Direct the needle just inferior to the contralateral nipple or as to bisect the angle created by the clavicle and sternocleidomastoid clavicular head. The needle should be 10° above parallel.
Depth of insertion before flash is 2-3 cm.
Supraclavicular ultrasound-guided cannulation
Ultrasound supraclavicular Image
Place the ultrasound probe longitudinally along the superior edge of the clavicle and angle the probe caudally. The vein will be identified as a non-pulsatile vessel in its long axis.
Visualize the subclavian vein as it joins the internal jugular to the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein.
Insert the needle directly underneath the lateral aspect of the ultrasound probe in-plane and angled towards the sternal notch.
The needle tip should be visualized at all times. Track the needle tip as it successfully enters the vessel in the longitudinal view and flashback is attained.
Femoral line anatomical cannulation
The femoral vein is a common anatomic site of choice during cardiac arrest, as it is spatially separated from chest compressions and the airway. Groin pulsatations may be venous rather than arterial. 
Femoral ultrasound-guided cannulation Image
Internal jugular anatomical cannulation
Posterior approach
Insert needle at the lateral aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at approximately the midpoint along the length of the muscle.
Apply pressure on the sternocleidomastoid to gently lift the muscle away from the needle.
Direct the needle just underneath the body of the sternocleidomastoid at a 45° angle towards the suprasternal notch.
Flashback will occur at >5 cm.
Has a decreased risk of arterial injury, hemothorax, and pneumothorax compared with the anterior approach. 
Anterior approach
Insert needle at a 30-45° angle along the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid and 2 fingerbreadths above the clavicle.
Direct needle towards the ipsilateral nipple and away from the carotid pulsation.
Catheter tip location
Site selection with height-based equations: 
Right subclavian: (height/10) − 2 cm
Left subclavian: (height/10) + 2 cm
Right internal jugular: (height/10) cm
Left internal jugular: (height/10) + 4 cm
General guidelines: 
Right internal jugular: 16-18 cm
Left internal jugular: 18-20 cm
Right subclavian: 16 cm
Left subclavian: 20 cm
Femoral: 15-30 cm
Post-procedural Care
Confirming placement
Appropriate placement of the CVC is based on 2 components:
Ensuring a venous (rather than arterial) location
Determining the location of the catheter tip
Ensuring a venous location
Visual appearance
After the initial flashback upon accessing the vessel and removing the syringe, monitor the backflow for pulsatility.
PITFALLS
Bright red, pulsatile blood indicates a potential arterial puncture, whereas slow, dark, oozing blood is generally venous.
In profound shock states, this may not be reliable, as a dark non-pulsatile appearance may still represent arterial blood.
Pressure transduction
Use commercially available disposable pressure monitors to ensure venous (0-15 mm Hg) rather than arterial (55-75 mm Hg) pressures.
Tubing extension: Exchange the needle for an angiocatheter via the wire, and attach the tubing extension.
The provider may also use the wire sheath as tubing. Hold the tubing parallel to the ground and allow 20 cm of blood to fill the tubing. Raise the tubing straight up, perpendicular to the vessel. If the catheter is in a vein, the blood level will fall to that of the CVP. If the catheter is in an artery, it will continue to rise and may be pulsatile. 
Pressure transduction: Thread the angiocatheter over the wire and connect to a pressure transducer attached to a bedside monitor. Evaluate the pressure (central venous [0-15 mm Hg] vs. arterial [55-75 mm Hg]) and waveform.
Blood gas sampling: Draw a blood gas sample from the needle prior to dilation. Compare PO2 to arterial PaO2. Generally, the central venous PO2 should be 30-45 mm Hg, whereas arterial PO2 will be 60-100 mm Hg.
Ultrasound: When using, visualize the needle tip at all times. Visualize the needle tip as it enters the desired vessel. Visualize the wire within the desired vessel in both transverse and longitudinal views.
Apply skin pressure caudal to the wire insertion to improve visibility of the guidewire within the vein. 
PEARLS
Saline flush test: Obtain a subxiphoid or apical 4-chamber view of the heart. Inject 10 mL of normal saline and assess for bubbles in the right atrium and right ventricle. The presence of bubbles confirms that the catheter is in the venous system.  Bubbles should appear within less than 2 s. Non-agitated saline works equally well. 
EM:RAP HD: Saline Flush to Confirm Central Line Placement EM:RAP Video
Determining the location of the catheter tip
Ideal location
Classic teaching has stated that the tip of an internal or subclavian CVC should be placed in the lower superior vena cava.
The optimal catheter tip position remains controversial.
Generally, to limit arrhythmias or cardiac complications, the tip should sit outside the right atrium.
The right superior heart border on chest X-ray does not reliably determine whether the tip is within the atrium. 
In 2,348 critical care patients with CVCs, no difference was found in the incidence of complications for patients with the catheter in the right atrium compared with patients with the tip in the superior vena cava. 
Permanent hemodialysis catheters are generally targeted to have the tip within the right atrium. 
Malposition was generally well tolerated with no cases of vascular perforation, local thrombosis, or cerebral symptoms in a study of 1,619 patients. 
PERSPECTIVES
It is generally acceptable for the catheter to be located anywhere in the superior vena cava or right atrium. 
Ultrasound
The use of ultrasound allows for bedside assessment immediately after line placement.
Confirm that the CVC is not in the contralateral internal jugular or subclavian vessel.
Visualize the heart to assess for the line tip in the right atrium or right ventricle.
Perform a saline flush test to confirm venous location.
The exact location of the catheter tip cannot generally be confirmed. Assess for lung sliding to rule out pneumothorax.
Compared with chest X-ray, ultrasound is superior for detecting pneumothorax in supine trauma patients examined by experienced sonographers. 
Allows for faster confirmation than chest X-ray. 
A meta-analysis by Smit in 2018 noted that ultrasound is accurate and feasible for detecting CVC malposition and iatrogenic injury. Advantages over radiography include decreased radiation and speed. 
Hourmozdi and colleagues showed that ultrasound-guided internal jugular placement may not require routine confirmation radiography, given the exceedingly low levels of relevant complications. 
Further study is required with various ultrasound confirmation protocols before radiography can be definitively considered unnecessary.
See https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/does-central-line-position-matter-can-we-use-ultrasonography-to-confirm-line-position/.
Chest X-ray
Benefit: Allows for direct visualization of the catheter location.
Allows for the assessment of large pneumothorax and hemothorax.
Catheters occasionally travel into small veins, into contralateral central vessels, or caudally, and occasionally form loops or unexpected turns.
The right subclavian vein is associated with the highest rate of malposition. 
Complications
Arterial puncture
In rare cases, arterial puncture can result in severe bleeding, limb ischemia, or thrombosis.
In shock states, arterial puncture may not readily be recognized.
PEARLS
Ultrasound reduces arterial puncture in the internal jugular by 72%. 
Incidence of arterial puncture with ultrasound-guided internal jugular is 1.4%. 
If arterial puncture occurs:
Hold direct pressure for >10 min to limit hematoma formation.
Assess site for hematoma formation and re-examine the patient, including an airway and neurologic examination.
Generally, arterial puncture requires no surgical intervention, although lacerations may require repair.
Arterial dilation or arterial laceration
Hold direct pressure and correct coagulopathy.
For the internal jugular site, ensure airway patency.
PEARLS
Leave the dilator or central line in place if not already removed from the artery.
Consult Vascular Surgery.
Hemothorax and pneumothorax
Pneumothorax requiring a chest tube was found to occur in 1.5% of subclavian and 0.5% of internal jugular CVC cannulations. 
Hemothorax may occur with significant vascular injury.
If pneumothorax or hemothorax occurs:
Place a thoracostomy tube.
Consider a surgical consultation in cases of significant intrathoracic bleeding.
Wire-induced arrhythmias
Guidewire-induced arrhythmias may occur during CVC placement and may progress to malignant arrhythmias in some cases. 
PEARLS
Lee et al. found that the depth of wire was associated with arrhythmia incidence, noting that guidewire depths of 15-17.5 cm before tissue dilation were associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmia in comparison to 20 cm. 
If arrhythmias occur:
Retract the wire.
If arrhythmia persists and/or leads to hemodynamic instability, treat with antiarrhythmics or cardioversion, as appropriate.
Venous air embolism
Large venous air emboli may occlude the pulmonary arteries, leading to obstructive shock. Patients with right-to-left shunt may also experience strokes or systemic air embolism. Early recognition and treatment are key. 
Maintain occlusion over open needle hubs or catheter ports to reduce such risks.
If a venous air embolism is suspected:
Place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position.
Aspirate air and blood from the CVC.
If the patient is unstable, consider emergency thoracotomy to aspirate air directly from the right ventricle, and consider extracorporeal life support or hyperbaric oxygen treatment.
Catheter-associated venous thromboembolism
Catheter-associated venous thromboembolism occurs in 0.5%, 0.9%, and 1.4% of subclavian, jugular, and femoral CVC placements, respectively.
If catheter-associated venous thromboembolism occurs:
Most patients should receive anticoagulation unless contraindicated. 
Routine CVC removal is not recommended.
Infection
Central line-associated bloodstream infections are implicated in 28,000 deaths per year, with an average cost of $2.3 billion.  Central line bundling policies have been implemented, with a significant reduction in the incidence of central line-associated bloodstream infections. 
Infections occur in 0.5%, 1.4%, and 1.2% of subclavian, jugular, and femoral line placements, respectively. 
CVCs should be removed as rapidly as possible, as the risk increases with the duration (days) of catheter placement.
If central line-associated bloodstream infection is suspected:
Obtain blood cultures (one peripherally, one from the line).
Remove CVC in cases of severe infection or shock.
Consider advanced studies such as line tip culture or time-to-positivity study comparing cultures drawn from CVC and peripheral blood.
Administer antimicrobials as indicated.
Wire or catheter embolization
Embolization can occur if the catheter or wire is withdrawn through the needle or if the guard is not properly secured, with a mortality rate as high as 60%. 
May cause infection, thrombosis, arrhythmias, pulmonary emboli, myocardial injury, or perforation. 
Chest X-ray may be helpful in identifying the wire location.

Indications
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), also called extracorporeal life support, is a form of mechanical life support for the lungs and/or heart.
Venovenous ECMO provides a pulmonary bypass in the setting of multiple etiologies for respiratory failure:
Pneumonia
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
Severe status asthmaticus
Chronic lung disease as a bridge to lung transplant
Severe air leak syndromes such as a bronchopulmonary fistula
Airway obstruction and the inability to intubate or secure a surgical airway
Venoarterial ECMO provides cardiac and pulmonary bypass for conditions that cause cardiac failure with or without respiratory failure:
Cardiac arrest
Cardiogenic shock
Pulmonary embolism
Myocardial infarction
Myocarditis
Heart transplant rejection
Cardiotoxic drug overdose (eg, beta or calcium channel blockers)
Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) utilizes venoarterial ECMO for patients in cardiac arrest.
Cardiac arrest patients are potential candidates for extracorporeal CPR if they have experienced the following:
A witnessed arrest with bystander CPR
Persistent arrest despite traditional advanced cardiac life support (ACLS)
A chest compression time of less than 60 minutes
No other life-limiting diseases
When running an extracorporeal CPR code, care must be taken to continue high-quality CPR in addition to initiating ECMO.
PITFALLS
Because extracorporeal CPR codes can divert resources away from traditional ACLS, reversible causes of arrest such as potassium derangement, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, airway obstruction, or a misplaced endotracheal tube should still be considered.
Femoral artery and vein vascular access via smaller cannulae (5 French and 9 French) should be obtained shortly after the patient arrives, while information is simultaneously gathered to determine whether the patient is an extracorporeal CPR candidate.
Equipment

Standard equipment for central venous access
5-9 French cannula
Long guidewire
ECMO dilator set
ECMO venous drainage cannula (21-25 French)
ECMO circuit: Tubing, pump head, membrane lung, heat exchanger, pump, pump console, gas line, flow meter attached to oxygen, blender (optional).
Unfractionated heparin
Equipment for Venovenous ECMO
All equipment listed above for venoarterial ECMO
Configuration with two cannulae (a 19-23 French ECMO return cannula plus a 21-25 French venous drainage cannula or a 13-31 French single- or dual-lumen catheter).
Technique
Cannulation is divided into three stages:
Stage I: Femoral and arterial sheaths are inserted into the femoral vessels and utilized for medication administration and hemodynamic monitoring while ECMO candidacy is determined. (See Chapter: Arterial Line Placement) (See Chapter: Central Venous Catheterization)
A 5 French cannula is inserted into the femoral artery.
A 9 French cannula is inserted into the femoral vein.
These lines can be used to administer cardiac arrest medications and to transduce arterial pressures. These pressures are helpful in diagnosing cardiac arrest, as many patients thought to have pulseless electrical activity may actually be in profound shock.
The arterial line will help guide chest compression quality and predict the return of spontaneous circulation.
Stage II: If the patient is determined to be an ECMO candidate, the arterial and vascular sheaths are replaced with larger ECMO cannulae and connected to the primed ECMO circuit.
A long wire, typically 180 cm or longer, is inserted into the existing sheaths.
Several variations on these wires exist, with varying stiffness.
Use caution not to insert a wire that is too short for the catheter length.
A bolus of unfractionated heparin is given once the wires are in place.
Unfractionated heparin at a dose of 5,000-10,000 units, depending on patient weight, is given.
The initial venous and arterial sheaths are removed.
A dermatotomy is performed with an 11-blade scalpel.
Serial dilation is performed to increase the size of the vessel hole to accommodate the ECMO cannulae.
In a normal-sized adult, a 17 French arterial cannula and a 21 French venous cannula are reasonable.
Suggested cannula sizes vary among institutions.
ECMO cannulae are inserted and connected to the external ECMO circuit.
The cannulae are secured to the patient.
Stage III: The ECMO pump flow is initiated.
Set the sweep gas flow to 4 L/min (approximately 1 L/min of sweep gas per 1 L/min of ECMO blood flow).
Increase the speed to 1,500 rpm before the final arterial clamp is removed.
Stop chest compressions once the ECMO blood flow is initiated.
Ensure that the tubing shows appropriate color differentiation (dark + bright red).
Increase the ECMO blood flow to 3-5 L/min to achieve an appropriate perfusing mean arterial pressure (MAP) without causing access insufficiency, commonly referred to as “chatter.”
If there is a low flow after ECMO initiation, troubleshooting should include looking for additional clamps or kinks in the circuit/cannulae, adding volume to deter “chatter,” verifying cannula placement, and adjusting the speed of the ECMO pump.
Post-procedure
Post-pump-initiation considerations:
PEARLS
Early right radial arterial blood gas (ABG) and pressure monitoring are important to ensure adequate perfusion, ventilation, and oxygenation of the brain and coronaries (differential hypoxemia).
Adjust the sweep gas according to the PaCO2 measured on the ABG.
PaCO2 must be carefully monitored because inadvertent high sweep gas flow rates can result in dangerous drops in the PaCO2.
Defibrillate persistent ventricular fibrillation (VF).
Manage vasopressors and volume expanders based on arterial pressure tracings.
PEARLS
Targeted temperature management is necessary after cardiac arrest.
Use the ECMO heater/cooler.
PEARLS
Start an inotrope to prevent left ventricular (LV) distention.
Discuss the case with all needed consultants (Cardiothoracic Surgery, Cardiology, intensivists, and Interventional Radiology).
Early coronary revascularization in the cardiac catheterization lab is important for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.
The extremity that contains the femoral arterial catheter is at risk for ischemia. Plan for distal perfusion catheter insertion in the location at which the initial ECMO cannulation was performed, the catheter lab, the interventional radiology suite, or the operating room.

Background
ECMO Modes
ECMO, also called extracorporeal life support, is a form of cardiac and/or pulmonary mechanical life support. Venoarterial ECMO drains deoxygenated blood from the central venous system and returns oxygenated blood to the arterial system, thereby providing a cardiopulmonary bypass. Venoarterial ECMO is used for cardiogenic shock and cardiopulmonary arrest. Venovenous ECMO drains deoxygenated blood from the central venous system and returns oxygenated blood to the central venous system, thereby providing a pulmonary bypass. Venovenous ECMO is used for respiratory failure.
In the most common cannula configuration for peripheral venoarterial ECMO, the access cannula is located in the femoral vein draining blood from the inferior vena cava, and the return cannula is positioned in the femoral artery, thereby permitting retrograde blood flow up the aorta. Image
In one of the most common venovenous ECMO cannula configurations, the access cannula is positioned in the femoral vein draining blood from the inferior vena cava, and the return cannula is located in the internal jugular vein returning blood to the right atrium. Figure Figure
Circuit Components
A simple ECMO circuit includes the following components:
Access cannula and tubing: Drains blood from the central venous system
Centrifugal pump: Pulls blood out of the body and pushes it through a membrane lung and back into the body
Membrane lung: Oxygenates blood and removes carbon dioxide
Return cannula and tubing: Returns blood to the patient’s venous (venovenous ECMO) or arterial (venoarterial ECMO) system
Flow probe: Measures the blood flow through the circuit
Sweep gas: Oxygen or blended oxygen and air that moves through the membrane lung
Heater/cooler: Warms or cools the blood as it moves through the membrane lung
More complex circuits have additional components and allow the provider to measure pressures throughout the circuit, continuously monitor oxygen saturation and hemoglobin content, and detect air bubbles. Figure
ECMO Physiology
General Circuit Physiology
To control blood flow through the centrifugal ECMO pump, the speed (in rpm) can be increased or decreased. As the speed is increased, access pressures become more negative and return pressures increase, thus generating a pressure differential across the pump head that moves blood through the circuit. EM:RAP Video
All centrifugal pumps are preload-sensitive and afterload-limited. In situations with inadequate preload (eg, inadequate central venous blood volume or extrinsic compression on the inferior vena cava) and increased resistance (eg, smaller-caliber/kinked/malpositioned cannulae, an aging membrane lung with an accumulated clot, or high systemic vascular resistance in venoarterial ECMO), the blood flow will be lower for any given speed.
The sweep gas is composed of 100% oxygen or a blend of air and oxygen. Blood is oxygenated and CO2 is removed via diffusion across a membrane lung.
Because CO2 diffuses across a membrane 20-fold faster than oxygen, CO2 levels in the blood are measured by the diffusion gradient created between the blood and the sweep gas. If the sweep gas flow rate (L/min) is increased, the sweep gas is more rapidly replaced with gas that does not contain CO2, thus maintaining a steep diffusion gradient and rapidly “sweeping” CO2 from the blood. The sweep gas flow rate is analogous to native lung minute ventilation.
The sweep gas flow rate does not affect oxygenation unless the sweep gas is turned off. In this case, there is no oxygen-containing gas to interact with the blood.
Oxygenation of the blood exiting the membrane lung is dependent upon the supply of sweep gas (regardless of rate) and the function of the membrane lung. After multiple days of use, fibrin and clots can build up on the membrane, leading to a decreased surface area for gas exchange and decreased efficiency of blood oxygenation. Figure Figure Figure
Venoarterial ECMO Physiology
Hemodynamics
Venoarterial ECMO primarily functions as hemodynamic support for a patient in cardiogenic shock. The total systemic blood flow equals the sum of the patient’s native cardiac output and ECMO blood flow. In peripheral venoarterial ECMO, these two blood flows mix in a region within the aorta, depending on the magnitude of the native heart’s cardiac output. This region is called the mixing cloud. Figure
As the ECMO flow is increased, the native heart preload is decreased and the afterload is increased. This is a particularly important concept that is used to choose the ideal ECMO blood flow rate by means of echocardiography. (See: Circuit Initiation and Post-Pump Care, LV distention)
To achieve a perfusing MAP, ECMO blood flow contributes to the native cardiac output, vasopressors (or vasodilators) address systemic vascular resistance, and volume administration (or diuresis) addresses blood volume. Figure
Oxygenation
Oxygenation of the patient’s organs by blood supplied by ECMO is determined by the location of the mixing cloud.
The oxygen content of blood that comes from the native heart will be dependent upon the native lung function.
As long as the membrane lung is functioning, blood coming from ECMO is 100% oxygenated.
CO2 Removal
The CO2 content of blood supplied by ECMO is determined by the sweep gas flow rate.
The CO2 content of blood leaving the native heart is determined by native lung alveolar ventilation.
The patient’s arterial CO2 will be dependent upon the location of the mixing cloud, which is determined by the ECMO blood flow rate and the amount of native cardiac output moving blood through the lungs.
Venovenous ECMO Physiology
Hemodynamics
Venovenous ECMO does not directly affect hemodynamics.
The same volume of blood that is removed from the central venous system by ECMO is returned to the same location.
Oxygenation
Venovenous ECMO supports patients with hypoxic respiratory failure by supplying oxygenated blood to the right atrium.
The mixed venous oxygen content is increased (SvO2 in the pulmonary artery), thus obviating the effects of pneumonia, ARDS, aspiration, etc. on the pulmonary shunt. Figure
As the ECMO blood flow is increased, a larger percentage of the native heart’s preload will be oxygenated by ECMO, leading to a higher SvO2 and a higher SpO2.
CO2 removal:
The patient’s PaCO2 is calculated based on the combined effects of the sweep gas flow rate in the membrane lung and alveolar ventilation of the native lung.
Indications and Special Considerations
Extracorporeal CPR
Employment of venoarterial ECMO during cardiac arrest is termed extracorporeal CPR.
The goal of extracorporeal CPR is to restore blood flow prior to the onset of irreversible organ ischemia. This approach allows time for native heart recovery or definitive interventions.
Careful patient selection must be utilized to identify patients with the highest likelihood of survival with extracorporeal CPR.
Many extracorporeal CPR centers have developed their own inclusion and exclusion criteria, based on the following general principles: 
Patient Characteristics
Sudden cardiac arrest
Potential to return to a high previous baseline level of function
CPR
Witnessed arrest
High-quality CPR, increasing the likelihood of neuroprotection
Reversible Arrest Etiology
Acute myocardial infarction amenable to revascularization
Massive pulmonary embolism treatable with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and anticoagulation
Accidental hypothermia with the ability to rapidly rewarm
Cardiotoxic drug ingestion that will resolve after drug metabolism
Timing
The ideal timing for the employment of ECMO is unknown.
The optimal initiation is currently thought to be 25-60 minutes after the onset of cardiac arrest.
After 25 minutes, the patient is in persistent refractory cardiac arrest and is therefore unlikely to survive with traditional ACLS. 
Patients cannulated after 60 minutes have poor neurologic outcomes. 
A sub-population of patients that are candidates for venoarterial ECMO include those with severe electrical instability and frequent cardiac arrests, either due to ventricular tachycardia (VT)/VF from myocardial ischemia or cardiotoxic drug overdose (eg, sodium channel blockers or antidysrhythmics).
Evidence supporting the use of extracorporeal CPR in cardiac arrest includes case series, registry data, and a few multicenter trials. 
These series involve heterogeneous inclusion/exclusion criteria, insertion locations, and practitioners involved in ECMO initiation.
The most impressive data series to date is from Minneapolis, where cardiologists initiate ECMO in the cardiac catheterization lab for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in VF. They reported a neurologically intact (Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2) survivorship of 40% in their first 100 patients.  In January 2020, this group published a comparative trial of VF patients treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation at their institution versus patients treated in the amiodarone arm of the ALPS trial (Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo Study). Survival in the extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation group was significantly better at every 10 minute interval where data existed (>20 min of CPR). 
The author’s center in San Diego published an 8-year case series in which emergency physicians initiated ECMO in a broader inclusion cohort. A 25% rate of survival to discharge was observed, with a significant improvement in survival over concurrent controls. 
Several institutions have reported positive outcomes for extracorporeal CPR vs. conventional CPR. 
Most recently, a group in Brussels showed a statistically significant improvement in the neurological function of survivors in an extracorporeal CPR group when cases were matched. 
The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry collects data from ECMO centers around the world and contains >1,000 extracorporeal CPR cases with a survival-to-discharge rate of 28%. 
Reynolds and colleagues published a trial that specifically evaluated patients who meet these inclusion criteria and found that even these highly selected patients had a survival of less than 5%. 
In Japan, two large multicenter trials evaluating the use of extracorporeal CPR have been published.
The SAVE-J trial compared 26 hospitals that offered extracorporeal CPR to 20 hospitals that did not offer extracorporeal CPR.
There was a statistically significant improvement in survivorship of over 4-fold compared with patients treated at non-extracorporeal CPR centers. 
While many of the extracorporeal CPR papers show promising results, enthusiasm for the adoption of extracorporeal CPR must be tempered due to the limitations of these studies.
To date, no prospectively randomized trials have been performed, and confounding variables not addressed in logistic regression calculations may still play a significant role in patient outcomes.
It is important to consider the data regarding who is initiating ECMO. Most data sets include cardiothoracic surgeons as the primary initiators/cannulators. Important exceptions to this include Paris, where anesthesiologists and emergency physicians initiate pre-hospital ECMO. A different training model exists in Japan, but many cannulations are performed by emergency physicians. Yannopoulos exclusively utilizes cardiologists for ECMO initiation, cannulation, and management. The authors’ center in San Diego utilizes emergency physicians to initiate ECMO and cannulate patients and intensivists to manage the patient in the ICU.
Shock
Venoarterial ECMO is the highest level of mechanical circulatory support for patients in cardiogenic shock.
This approach can be employed in patients with LV, right ventricular, or biventricular failure who cannot be supported with vasoactive medications and percutaneous microaxial or intra-aortic balloon pumps. 
Potential medical conditions include myocardial infarction, myocarditis, acute decompensated chronic heart failure, massive pulmonary embolism, heart transplant rejection, and cardiotoxic drug overdose (eg, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers).
Potential surgical diseases include post-cardiotomy shock and primary graft dysfunction after a heart transplant.
Some centers employ venoarterial ECMO for septic shock, targeting patients with septic cardiomyopathy. However, outcomes in these patients are poor. Mechanical circulatory support for improving blood flow is not the physiologic answer for vasoplegic shock. 
Depending on the etiology of the acute heart disease and the patient’s pre-existing ventricular function, long-term strategies for discontinuing venoarterial ECMO include native heart recovery, durable ventricular assist device placement, total artificial heart, heart transplant, or end-of-life care if none of these listed interventions are viable options. 
The development of cardiogenic shock centers and referral systems may help accelerate care for these patients and may enable transport to dedicated cardiac centers with many options for advanced heart failure therapy. 
Evidence for venoarterial ECMO in cardiogenic shock is as follows:
There are no randomized controlled trials that compare the use of venoarterial ECMO to medical therapy or other forms of mechanical circulatory support for patients in cardiogenic shock.
Current evidence consists of registry data, prospective observational studies, retrospective cohort studies, and case series.
Myocarditis has the highest survival-to-discharge rates, at ~70%. 
Other conditions, such as myocardial infarction, acute decompensated heart failure, and post-cardiotomy shock, have survival-to-discharge rates of 25-45%. 
From 2013 to 2018, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry reported a 48% overall survival for non-extracorporeal-CPR venoarterial ECMO. 
It is challenging to investigate the efficacy of venoarterial ECMO in the management of cardiogenic shock due to the widespread use of mechanical circulatory support for heart failure in cardiac critical care, which is often considered to be standard of care and is potentially unethical to withhold from an eligible patient.
Respiratory Failure
Venovenous ECMO can be employed for patients with severe pulmonary failure refractory to traditional supportive care.
Traditional supportive care for patients with ARDS includes low tidal volume and pressure ventilation, deep sedation to treat ventilator dyssynchrony, positive end-expiratory pressure titration, neuromuscular blockade, proning, recruitment maneuvers, and inhaled pulmonary artery vasodilators.
Venovenous ECMO may be used for medical conditions that include severe hypoxemia due to ARDS, hypercarbia due to asthma, hypoxemic or hypercarbic respiratory failure due to exacerbated chronic lung disease as a bridge to a lung transplant, severe air leak syndromes such as bronchopulmonary fistula that cannot be ventilated with mechanical ventilation, or airway obstruction with the inability to intubate or secure a surgical airway. 
Surgical conditions for which venovenous ECMO can be considered include primary graft dysfunction after lung transplant and post-pulmonary artery endarterectomy.
Strategies for discontinuing venovenous ECMO include native lung recovery, lung transplant, and end-of-life care.
Evidence for venovenous ECMO in respiratory failure is as follows:
ARDS is the most-studied indication for venovenous ECMO.
The CESAR (conventional ventilatory support vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure) randomized controlled trial in 2009 compared the mortality of ARDS patients referred to an ECMO center to that of ARDS patients who received conventional care outside of a tertiary care center that offers ECMO. 
Patients in the ECMO group had a survival rate of 63% compared with patients in the control group, who had a survival rate of 47%.
It is important to note that only 75% of patients referred to an ECMO center were actually cannulated for venovenous ECMO.
Shortly after this article was published, the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic precipitated the widespread use of venovenous ECMO in adults.
An observational trial from Australia and New Zealand reported a 79% survival rate of patients managed with venovenous ECMO. 
A prospective cohort from the United Kingdom matched ECMO center-referred patients (where 86% of patients were placed on ECMO) to conventional care patients, with survival rates of 76% and 50%, respectively. 
A prospective cohort study from the French REVA (Réseau Européen en Ventilation Artificielle) database compared ECMO patients to matched controls and reported no difference in survival. However, ECMO patients that were not matched had a significantly higher survival rate than those included in the analysis. 
The EOLIA (ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS) randomized controlled trial compared ECMO cannulation with conventional care and was terminated early due to futility because it showed no statistically significant difference in survival (65% vs. 54%, respectively, P = .09). 
One-quarter of patients in the conventional care arm crossed over to ECMO.
A post-hoc Bayesian analysis incorporating EOLIA data suggested that venovenous ECMO offers a modest mortality benefit and an absolute risk reduction of 2-11%. However, this type of analysis has not been verified. 
From 2013 to 2018, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry reported a 59% overall survival rate when venovenous ECMO was utilized for any type of respiratory failure. 
Although ECMO for ARDS is safe without significant ECMO-related complications and although survival rates are higher at ECMO centers, a conclusive statement regarding the benefits of ECMO cannot be made.
Trauma
Reports on the use of venoarterial ECMO in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock are limited, but the little data that have been published demonstrate some potential advantages. 
The deadly triad of trauma (hypothermia, dilution of coagulation factors, and acidosis) can be rapidly corrected with ECMO.
Animal data have shown the benefit of venoarterial ECMO in the setting of hypothermia and acidosis.
Heparinization of the circuit is a potential drawback, although some studies suggest that anticoagulation may not be necessary.
Some data suggest that patients with an intracranial hemorrhage did not worsen with ECMO use.
There are limited data for this indication. Significantly more research is needed before any formal recommendations can be made.
Organ Donation
The use of ECMO as an adjunct during organ donation has been expanding worldwide. 
In many countries, patients who are declared brain dead while on ECMO are eligible organ donors.
The use of a balloon in the proximal aorta to occlude the flow of blood above the diaphragm can eliminate brain and heart perfusion while maintaining that of the liver and kidneys.
Rates of procurement have been similar, if not better, than that of traditional controls. 
Future Considerations
Many decisions regarding the future of ECMO remain to be made. One future consideration is whether extracorporeal CPR cannulation should be performed in the pre-hospital setting, Emergency Department (ED), or catheterization lab. Japan has recently started using hybrid fluoroscopy suites in the ED to initiate ECMO.  Pre-hospital ECMO is performed in Paris and London and will be started in several other cities.
The use of ECMO for other respiratory causes is also an issue for future consideration. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be treated by correcting respiratory acidosis without the need for intubation. Smaller venous catheters that may have fewer complications can be used for this indication.
Studies on patients who present in traumatic hemorrhagic arrest are currently being performed for ECMO and profound hypothermia. A trauma center in Baltimore is cooling patients below 20°C using iced saline and complete exsanguination with ECMO.  The severely hypothermic patient is then brought to the operating room, where the traumatic injuries are corrected. The patient then receives transfused blood and is rewarmed to physiological temperatures. Animal data are promising, but the translation to humans is still in the early stages of research. 
General Contraindications
Futility: When the patient is already too sick with irreversible multiorgan failure and will die even if ECMO is employed
Pre-existing life-limiting conditions, such as:
Advanced malignancy
End-stage liver disease
End-stage renal disease
Severe central nervous system injury
End-stage lung disease without option for a lung transplant
Chronic advanced heart failure without option for a heart transplant or ventricular assist device
Advanced age (center-dependent)
Inability to accept blood products and limited vascular access that makes cannulation impossible
For venovenous ECMO, outcomes are poor despite the use of ECMO if the patient has already been on 7-10 days of high-intensity mechanical ventilation.
Technique
Running an Extracorporeal CPR Code
Running a code can lead to a chaotic environment, even without initiating ECMO. The delivery of high-quality CPR must be a priority, which requires organization. The easily correctable causes of the cardiac arrest need to be expediently treated. VF requires defibrillation with correct pad placement, potassium derangements must be rapidly identified and corrected, and an evaluation for airway obstruction, pneumothorax, or pericardial tamponade is critical. Patients with a suspected massive pulmonary embolism may have received thrombolytics prior to cardiac arrest. While not a contraindication to ECMO use, pre-cannulation administration of thrombolytics may increase the risk of bleeding.
Based on institution-specific factors, such as available space and human resources, the specifics of this organization can vary. One option is to have the nurse lead the code. In this case, the nurse is responsible for ensuring high-quality CPR, minimizing interruptions, defibrillating when indicated, and directing drug administration. Discussion with the physician code team leader prior to the arrival of the patient to the ED can solidify the specifics of epinephrine administration and other variations in cardiac arrest management. Image
When the team has an additional physician available, the job of the physician code team leader centers on gathering a history, assessing ECMO eligibility, and overseeing code management. The code leader is entrusted with airway management but does not perform any other procedures. These tasks are diverted to the cannulator. In stage I of extracorporeal CPR cannulation, the cannulator inserts placeholder arterial and venous lines that can be used to manage the arrest. Arterial transducers that are set up prior to the patient’s arrival can be helpful.
An additional helpful resource is a healthcare provider with a working knowledge of wire exchange and dilator insertion. This provider is named the wire assistant and can greatly improve the speed and safety with which ECMO cannulae can be inserted.
The overall philosophy of the ECMO code includes utilizing a small number of people who are specifically trained to do their tasks well. Because many ECMO codes can last over an hour, personnel substitutions may be necessary. While the use of mechanical CPR devices has not resulted in improved outcomes compared with human compressions, utilization of these devices during extracorporeal CPR may improve cannulation by offering more consistent compressions.  Due to hesitation in performing chest compressions in a moving ambulance, these devices may also aid in the ability to transport cardiac arrest patients out of the hospital during CPR. Care to ensure that these devices are properly placed and have not migrated is key. Figure
Cannulation
A step-wise approach to the initiation of ECMO is prudent. For out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, the decision to initiate ECMO can be difficult, as much of the necessary information is either missing or errant.
Cannulation is divided into three stages:
Stage I: Femoral and arterial sheaths are inserted into the femoral vessels and utilized for medication administration and hemodynamic monitoring while ECMO candidacy is determined.
A 5 French cannula is inserted into the femoral artery.
A 9 French cannula is inserted into the femoral vein.
These lines can be used to administer arrest medications and to transduce arterial pressures. These pressures are helpful in diagnosing cardiac arrest, as many patients thought to be in pulseless electrical activity may actually be in profound shock.
The arterial line will help guide chest compression quality and predict the return of spontaneous circulation.
Stage II: If the patient is determined to be an ECMO candidate, the arterial and vascular sheaths are replaced with larger ECMO cannulae and connected to the primed ECMO circuit. EM:RAP Video
A long wire, typically 180 cm or longer, is inserted into the existing sheaths.
Several variations on these wires exist, with varying stiffness.
Take care not to insert a wire that is too short.
A bolus of unfractionated heparin at a dose of 5,000-10,000 units, depending on patient size, is given once the wires are in place.
The initial venous and arterial sheaths are removed.
A dermatotomy is performed with an 11-blade scalpel.
Serial dilation is performed to increase the size of the vessel hole to accommodate the size of the ECMO cannulae.
In a normal-sized adult, a 17 French arterial cannula and a 21 French venous cannula is reasonable.
Suggested cannula sizes vary among institutions.
The ECMO cannulae are inserted.
The cannulae are connected to the tubing of a circuit primed with crystalloid using the wet-to-wet technique. EM:RAP Video
The cannulae are secured to the patient.
Stage III: The ECMO pump flow is initiated.
Assess the primed circuit to ensure that there is no air present.
Set the sweep gas flow to 3-4 L/min.
Set the blender to 100% oxygen.
Choose the temperature of the circuit.
Can be set to 33-36ºC for temperature management post-cardiac arrest 
Can be set to 37ºC in cases of accidental or environmental hypothermia
Increase the pump speed to 1,500-2,000 rpm before removing the final arterial clamp.
Setting this speed prevents the backflow of blood out of the patient once the clamps are removed.
Remove clamps on the access return tubing near the pump, which allows the blood flow to commence. EM:RAP Video
Post-Procedural Care
Stop chest compressions once ECMO blood flow is initiated.
Ensure appropriate tubing color differentiation.
Dark central venous blood should be leaving the body.
Bright oxygenated blood should leave the membrane lung. Photo
If blood is dark in both tubes, the membrane lung is not working. (See: Membrane Lung Failure) Photo
If blood is bright in both tubes, the cannulae are both in arteries. Photo
Increase ECMO blood flow to 3.5-5 L/min to achieve a perfusing MAP without causing access insufficiency “chatter.”
Vasopressors can be used to address a low systemic vascular resistance.
After a perfusing MAP has been achieved for a few minutes, electrolyte, acid-base, and gas exchange derangements will improve, and defibrillation for VF is more likely to be successful.
The ventilator can be set to routine settings unless there is concern for ARDS, in which case “ultra-protective” settings can be employed using very low tidal volumes.
The pulse oximeter should be placed on the right upper extremity to monitor for differential hypoxemia. (See: Differential Hypoxemia) ABG should be obtained 15-30 minutes after ECMO initiation, and adjustments in the sweep gas flow rate can be made as needed to adjust CO2.
The sweep gas flow rate can be changed in steps of 1 L/min, with repeat ABGs obtained after each change.
The membrane lung is extremely efficient at removing CO2. Care should be taken to not precipitously reduce the PaCO2 and cause a lethal alkalemia.
Anticoagulation should be initiated to decrease the risk of stroke, circuit thrombus, or intracardiac thrombus.
If the patient is bleeding, anticoagulation can be held temporarily because the circuit is heparin-coated.
A distal perfusion catheter should be placed to prevent limb ischemia in the leg in which the return cannula is located.
Prophylactic placement of these catheters decreases the incidence of limb ischemia. 
Once the patient’s blood pressure has stabilized, an echocardiogram should be obtained to assist with ECMO blood flow titration.
The ideal blood flow will be sufficiently high to achieve a perfusing MAP and to decompress the heart without resulting in LV distention. (See: Left Ventricular Distention)
Most venoarterial ECMO patients (except for those with a massive pulmonary embolism or isolated right heart failure) will require an inotrope to prevent LV distention and to promote blood flow through the heart.
Left heart catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention should be considered for VF and VT arrests. 
Complications
Flow Limitation
Each circuit has a limited maximum flow that can be achieved due to an excessively negative access pressure or an excessively high return (pre-membrane and post-membrane) pressure.
Ideally, the circuit will be able to achieve a target blood flow without requiring an extreme pressure setting.
Theoretically, as the pressure drops across resistors within the circuit, shear forces on red blood cells will increase and lead to hemolysis.
The pressure that should not be exceeded is the pressure that results in high-level hemolysis.
Assess daily lactate dehydrogenase and free hemoglobin levels to monitor for such conditions, in addition to watching for hemoglobinuria.
Access insufficiency occurs when the flow cannot be increased without an excessively negative access pressure.
This condition is typically secondary to either insufficient venous blood due to hypovolemia, a small access cannula, access cannula malposition, or a clot, kink, or compression.
Problems with the access cannula can be due to venoconstriction, abdominal compartment syndrome, tension pneumothorax, or pericardial tamponade.
Chatter is an extreme version of access insufficiency, when the inferior vena cava collapses onto the access cannula and causes the tubing to shake or “chatter.” EM:RAP Video
Chatter can damage the endothelium due to the suction of the catheter within the inferior vena cava, causing hemolysis.
Decrease the speed of the circuit, evaluate for potential causes of chatter, and consider fluid administration to ameliorate chatter.
Return obstruction occurs when the flow cannot be increased due to excessively high pre- or post-membrane pressures.
This condition can result from a high pump afterload due to high systemic vascular resistance, which is often caused by vasopressors (in venoarterial ECMO only), a small return cannula, a return cannula malposition/clot/kink, or membrane lung thrombosis.
If extremely high return pressures are noted after circuit initiation, immediately evaluate for return cannula malposition due to an arterial dissection or an extra-luminal location.
Left Ventricular Distention
Once a patient has been stabilized on venoarterial ECMO, it is important to ensure that there is some forward flow through the heart in patients with biventricular or LV failure.
Signs of poor forward flow include evidence of LV distention such as a narrow pulse pressure (<10 mm Hg), pulmonary edema, and a pulmonary artery catheter with increased wedge, pulmonary artery diastolic, and central venous pressures. 
LV distention is usually not a problem in patients cannulated for isolated right ventricular failure (eg, massive pulmonary embolism) because the LV is not afterload-sensitive.
Echocardiography will show a poor LV ejection fraction, an increased LV end-diastolic diameter, an aortic valve that does not open, and perhaps echocardiographic “smoke” that is indicative of stagnant ventricular blood.
An algorithmic approach to the extracorporeal CPR and newly placed ECMO patient can significantly decrease the incidence of LV distention. Once LV distention occurs, management becomes much more difficult. While much of this process will take place outside of the ED, initial considerations are paramount.
The following algorithmic approach can be applied for preventing LV distention: 
Primary goal: Ensure that the LV is ejecting blood.
Ensure a perfusing rhythm: VF/VT/atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rhythm requires correction.
Decrease peripheral vasopressors and increase ECMO blood flow: The goal is to maintain the MAP without increasing systemic vascular resistance.
Increase inotropes, such as epinephrine, dobutamine, or dopamine.
Diuresis: Consider removing fluids that may contribute to LV overload.
Mechanical vent: If medical management fails, then mechanical venting using a percutaneous microaxial pump (Impella), septostomy, or intra-aortic balloon pump should be considered.
Echo flow guidance: Frequent evaluations with echocardiography and pulmonary artery catheters are beneficial.
If left untreated, LV distention will lead to myocardial ischemia and delayed recovery, as well as an intracardiac thrombus. 
Differential Hypoxemia
When native cardiac function improves, the mixing cloud between the native cardiac output and ECMO blood flow moves down the aortic arch.
In the setting of a significant native pulmonary shunt (eg, aspiration, contusion, pneumonia, pneumothorax, or mucous plugging), blood coming from the native heart will be poorly oxygenated.
Regions of the body perfused by blood from the proximal aortic arch will become hypoxemic.
This phenomenon is called differential hypoxemia, or “north-south syndrome.”  Figure
ECMO can be discontinued if pulmonary procedures or changes to ventilator settings improve lung function and the heart has recovered. If the heart has not recovered sufficiently to come off ECMO but lung function has improved, venoarterial ECMO is continued. If the heart has recovered and no longer requires venoarterial ECMO but lung function is severely impaired, a switch to venovenous ECMO can be considered. If lung function is severely impaired and the heart is not yet ready to wean from venoarterial ECMO, a hybrid configuration called venovenoarterial ECMO can be employed.
Bleeding, Hemolysis, and Thrombosis
Ideally, both venovenous and venoarterial ECMO circuits should be anticoagulated to prevent circuit thrombosis, cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis, and stroke/intracardiac thrombosis in venoarterial ECMO. Circuit thrombosis can occur subacutely over days in the membrane lung, which is diagnosed by visible clots on the membrane lung, a high pressure drop across the membrane lung (called “delta P”) (See: Membrane Lung Failure below), and occasionally hemolysis. Pump head thrombosis, in which a clot forms at the inlet to the pump head, can occur acutely over hours. This condition is diagnosed by hemolysis and sometimes manifests with a noisy pump or a decrease in ECMO blood flow. Fibrin and clot build-up also often occurs at the stopcock and tubing connector sites. A lower blood flow through the circuit, particularly at rates <2 L/min, increases the risk of circuit thrombosis.
The anticoagulant used during ECMO and the method and target level for monitoring vary widely. One common strategy for venoarterial ECMO is to use an unfractionated heparin infusion to target an activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) time of 60-80 seconds or an anti-Xa level of 0.3-0.7 IU/mL. 
If the patient is bleeding, anticoagulation can be held because the circuit is heparin-coated. Blood products including fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets can be administered, with careful monitoring of membrane lung function for signs of clotting. Anticoagulation should be started as soon as possible in venoarterial ECMO patients. Due to the decreased risk of stroke and intracardiac thrombus in venovenous ECMO, the lower-risk approach is to hold anticoagulation for prolonged periods of time.
Intravascular hemolysis can be due to the aforementioned circuit clotting as well as extreme access and return pressures, particularly chatter, which causes cavitation and red blood cell shearing. 
Membrane Lung Failure
Membrane lung dysfunction can be attributed to either an acute disconnection of sweep gas flow or to gradual clot and fibrin accumulation. If the patient is hypoxemic, first examine the tubing; if both tubes are both dark, the problem lies within the membrane lung. If a normal (dark/bright) color differentiation is present, the problem lies with the patient (differential hypoxemia in venoarterial ECMO). Membrane lung dysfunction due to a disconnection from the sweep gas occurs acutely and must be immediately corrected. Membrane lung failure from clots and fibrin usually occurs slowly over days in the ICU, is diagnosed by the presence of visible clots on the membrane lung and a high delta P, and can be confirmed by a post-membrane blood gas.
Pump Failure
Pump failure is extremely rare, with the most common scenario being power loss, potentially during transport. Each ECMO circuit is equipped with a hand crank and a back-up pump to connect to the pump head and resume ECMO blood flow.
When to Urgently Come off ECMO
Coming off ECMO involves clamping the access and return tubing and should be employed in the following cases:
An extra-vascular cannula position, which can lead to artery dissection or exsanguination
Circuit rupture or accidental decannulation, which will lead to exsanguination (return cannula/tubing)
Air entrainment into the circuit until it is removed to prevent air embolism
Bubble detectors are often used to alert the provider to the presence of air. Often, the bubble detector on the return tubing is programmed to shut off the pump to prevent air embolism.
If a large volume of air is entrained (~20-60 mL or greater), the centrifugal pump will “air lock,” which means that it is no longer primed with liquid and flow will cease.
ECMO specialists and perfusionists spend many hours practicing maneuvers to remove air. Photo
When the circuit is clamped, immediate measures must be taken to support the patient using the ventilator, vasopressors, inotropes, and volume/blood administration until the ECMO blood flow can be safely restarted.",ECMO

Background
LP for the removal of CSF was first described in the late 19th century by Heinrich I. Quincke and Walter E. Wynter. 
Present-day LP is a common procedure in emergency medicine used to diagnose or exclude potentially life-threatening conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and bacterial meningitis.
Non-emergency LP can be useful in the diagnosis of other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and paraneoplastic syndromes, among others. Furthermore, LP can be used for the intrathecal administration of diagnostic or therapeutic agents. 
LP can also be used to treat conditions associated with elevated intracranial pressure, such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension or cryptococcal meningitis.
Indications and Special Considerations
Meningitis
LP for CSF analysis remains the only diagnostic procedure that can be used to definitively exclude the diagnosis of meningitis.
PITFALLS
In patients with a high pretest probability for bacterial meningitis, antimicrobial therapy (with consideration for adjunctive dexamethasone) should be initiated without delay.  This should not be construed as a recommendation to delay LP in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. Although conclusive data are limited, some studies have shown that the yield of CSF cultures can decrease as early as 2 to 4 h after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. 
Caution should be used when considering LP in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis and rapidly deteriorating neurological status, as this could suggest an increased risk of cerebral herniation after LP. 
PITFALLS
Opening pressure is commonly elevated in various types of meningitis, but this finding might not be seen in neonates, infants, or children. 
CSF Gram staining is useful when positive, but the sensitivity is widely variable and may be as low as 50%, particularly in children. 
CSF culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.
The utility of routine latex agglutination studies and Limulus lysate assays is questionable. 
CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can be used to detect a variety of bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, but the sensitivity and specificity may vary significantly. 
CSF lactate has been used to distinguish bacterial from viral (a.k.a. aseptic) meningitis. However, its sensitivity is decreased in patients who receive antibiotics prior to CSF analysis, and normal CSF lactate values may vary between labs and institutions. 
Common CSF characteristics in CNS infections Table
The Bacterial Meningitis Score can identify children with meningitis who are at very low risk for bacterial meningitis.
Pediatric patients with meningitis who have none of the following high-risk features are considered to have a very low risk for bacterial meningitis. 
Positive CSF Gram stain
CSF protein >80 mg/dL
CSF absolute neutrophil count >1,000 cells/mm3
Peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count >10,000 cells/mm3
Seizure before or at presentation
A retrospective review of 441 patients suggested that the Bacterial Meningitis Score may also be useful in adult patients and could reduce hospitalizations. 
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
Despite advancements in neuroimaging technology, LP remains an important diagnostic test to exclude non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage when the initial computed tomography (CT) imaging is negative.
The Ottawa SAH Rule is sensitive for ruling out non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in alert and neurologically intact patients. 
PEARLS
The American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Guidelines recommend LP or computed tomography angiography (CTA) to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage in adult patients still considered at risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage after a negative non-contrast head CT.
Shared decision-making is recommended to determine the most appropriate modality. 
Recent literature suggests that a non-contrast head CT (third-generation or newer) performed within 6 h of onset of severe headache concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage (and interpreted by a neuroradiologist or general radiologist who routinely reviews head CTs) is sufficiently accurate to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with a low pretest probability. 
Others suggest that an approach including non-contrast head CT, CTA, and LP may be necessary in patients with a higher pretest probability. 
For patients who undergo LP, the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is suggested by CSF xanthochromia and red blood cells (RBCs).
Distinguishing true subarachnoid hemorrhage from traumatic LP (“traumatic tap”) can be challenging, and specific cutoff values for ruling out subarachnoid hemorrhage are lacking.
Xanthochromia, a yellow discoloration of the supernatant of centrifuged CSF due to hemoglobin breakdown, is thought to require several hours to develop after the onset of bleeding. However, the minimum time and minimum amount of blood required for the detection of xanthochromia are not known. 
Some authors have suggested that spectrophotometric determination of xanthochromia is superior to visual methods, but most hospitals still use visual methods. While xanthochromia alone can have variable sensitivity, 1 study reported that the composite evaluation of xanthochromia and CSF RBC count is 100% sensitive. 
A prospective study evaluating 1,739 patients with acute non-traumatic headache who underwent LP to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage concluded that the absence of xanthochromia and the presence of fewer than 2,000 × 106 RBCs/L (2,000 RBCs/mm3) in the final collection tube “reasonably exclude” the diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
In a meta-analysis, Carpenter and colleagues reported that fewer than 1 in 10 emergency department (ED) patients with headache concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage are subsequently diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and that using a CSF RBC count threshold of 1,000 × 106/L has a positive likelihood ratio of 5.7 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.21. 
Clearance of RBCs when measured in the first tube (Tube 1) compared with the final tube (Tube 4) of CSF collection has been used to distinguish subarachnoid hemorrhage from traumatic tap, but this method is not without limitations. 
A threshold of 30% clearance has traditionally been used, but some authors recommend a higher threshold, with up to a 70% decrease in the final tube.  Regardless, consideration must be given for the presence of traumatic LP and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a rare condition that is more common in women and is strongly associated with obesity.
Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension often present with headache and may have visual changes, among other symptoms.
Patients with suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension require ophthalmologic evaluation for papilledema and visual acuity, as well as neurological evaluation.
PEARLS
LP may be necessary for diagnosis but should only be performed after these evaluations are conducted and after neuroimaging has ruled out a mass lesion and secondary causes of intracranial hypertension. 
Although CSF pressures vary diurnally, it is generally accepted that an opening pressure >25 cm H2O is required for the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. 
LP to relieve symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is controversial and temporary at best, with some studies suggesting that the pressure can return to previous levels within less than 2 h after the procedure. 
A temporizing surgical procedure, such as lumbar drain, may be necessary to preserve vision in some cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension while awaiting more definitive treatment. 
Coagulopathy
The risk of spinal epidural hematoma after LP is an important consideration when planning the procedure. The risk of this complication is considered acceptably low in patients without a known bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.
PEARLS
Aspirin therapy is not considered a contraindication to LP. 
Data are limited on the performance of emergency LP in the setting of dual-antiplatelet therapy, but it is typically considered a relative contraindication. 
A 2018 retrospective review of 100 adults who underwent LP while on dual-antiplatelet therapy identified no serious complications within 3 mo of the procedure, but case reports of serious complications do exist. 
Pharmacologic anticoagulation is generally considered a contraindication for LP in the ED. However, if the anticoagulation can be rapidly and reliably reversed, LP can be considered thereafter.
PITFALLS
Avoid or delay LP in patients with an international normalized ratio >1.5 or platelet count <40 × 109/L. 
LP may be performed safely in individuals with stable platelet counts >40 × 109/L, normal platelet function, and no other bleeding diathesis. Performing LP in patients with lower platelet counts may also be safe, but there are insufficient data to support this as a routine practice. An appropriate consideration of the risks and benefits of the procedure is necessary for any patient with thrombocytopenia. 
Although some might consider platelet transfusion prior to LP in patients with thrombocytopenia, the data on its benefit are limited. Additionally, there are no clear thresholds for administration or guidelines for use. 
Technique
Patient Positioning
The lateral recumbent position is preferred, as this will allow for an opening pressure measurement. The patient assumes a fetal position close to one side of the bed, bringing knees toward the chest and arching the lower back as much as possible. Shoulders and hips should remain perpendicular to the bed. A pillow is used to keep the head in line with the spine, and another pillow may be placed between the knees for comfort. Neck flexion does not help facilitate the procedure; in fact, it may actually lead to more discomfort and can cause airway compromise in infants.
Sitting the patient up may make it easier to identify the midline in certain populations (eg, obese patients, neonates). This may also aid CSF flow in dehydrated patients and help avoid hypoxia in neonates.  The patient sits on the side of the bed, leaning over a bedside table or stand, with a pillow to cushion the upper torso and arms. The feet are supported to keep the knees closer to the chest and to allow maximum opening of the lower lumbar interspaces.
Site Identification
The back and hips are palpated to identify the lower lumbar interspaces. This may be done prior to patient positioning if the area is going to be marked in advance. Radiographically, a line connecting the posterior–superior iliac crests intersects the midline at the L4 spinous process or L4-L5 interspace in most patients.  Clinically, however, palpation of this line usually corresponds to the L3 spinous process or L3-L4 interspace.  The initial attempt is performed at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace. The chosen area can then be marked with a pen or indentation.
The spinal cord terminates at the lower level of L1 in most individuals; thus, puncture can be performed safely from the L2-L3 to L5-S1 levels in adults and older children. At birth, however, the cord extends to L3; hence, infant LP should only be attempted at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. Figure
Sterile Technique
Sterile gloves are required, and a face mask is recommended, although there is no proof that this prevents iatrogenic infection.  Personal preference or facility requirements for personal protective equipment may also dictate the use of a cap and gown.
An antiseptic solution is applied in an expanding circular motion to the lower back using swabs that are usually supplied in the kit. Povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine (0.5% in 70% alcohol) are most commonly used.
PERSPECTIVES
Although the product inserts for chlorhexidine include a warning of the risk of arachnoiditis, the evidence for this risk is limited, and many experts still recommend its use. 
A sterile drape or towel is placed between the patient’s hip (or buttocks) and the bed. Multiple drapes are then placed around the sterile field, although most commercial kits have a single drape with a hole that is centered over the procedure site.
Local Anesthesia
Once the disinfectant has dried, local anesthesia (eg, 1% lidocaine) is infiltrated under the skin at the previously marked lumbar interspace. The deeper subcutaneous tissues (muscles and ligaments) are then infiltrated as well.
Some practitioners will also inject local anesthetic on both sides of the spinous processes near the lamina in an attempt to anesthetize the recurrent spinal nerves that innervate the interspinous ligaments and muscles.
It is advisable to use an ample amount of anesthetic in order to reduce procedural discomfort as much as possible.
Kit Set-Up
While the anesthetic is taking effect, the stopcock and manometer are connected, and the valve is checked.
This is also the time to ensure the availability of an additional spinal needle and supplemental lidocaine, in case either is needed for repeat procedure attempts.
Each specimen tube is opened and placed upright in the kit in sequential order, for easy availability once the CSF is flowing.
Needle Choices
In most cases, a 3.5-in, 20-ga needle is used for adults, although 22-ga and 18-ga needles are also used, and a 5-in needle is available for obese patients. A 2.5-in, 22-ga needle is typically used for children, while a 1.5-in, 22-ga needle is used for infants.
Thicker needles are more rigid but create larger holes in the dura and can increase the risk of post-dural puncture headache.  Finer needles are less rigid, making it technically more difficult to penetrate the soft tissues. The flow of CSF can be noticeably slower with needles smaller than 22-ga.
Traditional/cutting needles (usually Quincke type) are found in most standard kits; these have sharp cutting bevels with stylets in the lumen.
Newer, non-cutting, blunt, or pencil-point needles, including the Sprotte, Whitacre, and Gertie Marx needles, are also styletted but have side ports to withdraw CSF. The incidence of post-dural puncture headache is lower with these needles, thereby limiting the need for an epidural blood patch.  This was initially thought to be due to the needle separating rather than cutting the longitudinal dural fibers, but newer evidence suggests that the dura is more like a mesh matrix.  The blunt needles actually cause more trauma, and the ensuing inflammatory process is what limits the CSF leakage.  Figure
Needle Placement
The needle is held between the thumbs and index fingers and placed in the midline, perpendicular to the spinal column. A one-handed technique is possible with the more rigid (18- and 20-ga) and/or shorter needles.
If using a cutting needle, the bevel should be facing the patient’s flank, as this has also been shown to reduce the risk of post-dural puncture headache. 
Once the skin has been penetrated, the needle is gradually advanced, angling about 15°-20° cephalad and aiming toward the patient’s umbilicus.
Needle Advancement
The distance from the skin to the epidural space is about 45-55 mm but varies depending on the patient’s body mass index and overall size. 
Once through the adipose layer, the needle passes the supraspinous ligament, the interspinous ligament, and ultimately the ligamentum flavum, which covers the interlaminar space between vertebrae and assists the paraspinous muscles in maintaining an upright position.
Often, a “pop” can be felt upon passing through this tough, elastic membrane, but this cannot be consistently relied upon for every patient. Advancing the needle in smaller increments (3-5 mm) and periodically removing the stylet to check for CSF flow is a more reliable approach than feeling for the “pop.”
If bone is encountered, the needle should be partially withdrawn and redirected more cephalad before advancing again. If this continues to be a problem, palpate the patient again to ensure that the needle is in the midline. Other options include attempting the procedure at a higher or lower interspace or having the patient move to the seated position.
Use of the additional needle and supplemental lidocaine may be necessary at this time.
Alternative Approaches
The paramedian approach avoids the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, which may be calcified in elderly or arthritic patients. This approach can be easier and less painful in some patients, with fewer attempts needed.  EM:RAP Video
The set-up is similar to that of the midline approach, except that a longer needle may be necessary, as it enters the subarachnoid space at an angle. The patient may be either in the lateral recumbent position or sitting up; lower back flexion is unnecessary.
The caudal edge of the L4 spinous process is palpated, and the needle is inserted 1 cm inferior and 1 cm lateral to this spot, angling 10°-15° cephalad and 10°-15° medial.
If the lamina is encountered, the needle should be gradually adjusted in a more cephalad direction until the dura is penetrated.
Ultrasound can be an important assistive modality.
Difficult-to-palpate lumbar spine landmarks are found in 30% of patients needing LP in the ED, and using landmark palpation alone has been reported to fail or be traumatic in 28% of patients. 
Ultrasound has proven to be particularly helpful in patients with challenging anatomy, such as the pediatric population and obese patients. 
Multiple recent meta-analyses have shown the use of ultrasound guidance reduces the number of failed and traumatic procedures, as well as the overall number of attempts and redirections.  Overall procedural success rates, pain scores, and time to procedural success are also improved, albeit with uncertain clinical and statistical significance.

EM:RAP Ultrasound Guidance for Lumbar Puncture EM:RAP Video
If previous bedside ED techniques are unsuccessful, neuroradiology should be contacted for fluoroscopic guidance. This method may also be particularly helpful in obese patients or those with difficult anatomy (eg, previous lumbar surgery, scoliosis). This method is usually performed with patients in the prone position, at the L2-L3 or L3-L4 level.
Opening Pressure
Once inside the subarachnoid space, the stylet is removed, and the stopcock and manometer are attached to measure the opening pressure if the patient is in the lateral recumbent position. The patient is then instructed to relax and extend his/her legs to allow an unimpeded flow of CSF and prevent false elevation of the opening pressure, although some studies have shown that the effect of this maneuver is minimal.  Patients who are struggling (eg, infants) will also have inaccurate readings.
Normal opening pressure is 5-20 cm H2O. An elevation can indicate increased intracranial pressure, which can commonly be caused by infection or idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
Sample Collection
The 4 specimen tubes are filled sequentially, starting with the fluid from the manometer.
Each tube should receive at least 1 mL of CSF.
It is common to remove a total of about 8 mL of CSF during the procedure. Up to 15 mL may be required if special studies are necessary, and removal of up to 30 mL is generally safe and well tolerated. 
Needle Removal
The stylet is replaced prior to removal of the needle, which decreases the risk of post-dural puncture headache. 
Once the needle has been removed, pressure is placed on the site, and a bandage is applied.
Post-procedural Care
PEARLS
Historically, patients were told to lie flat for several hours after the procedure to decrease the risk of post-dural puncture headache as well as headache severity.  More recent studies suggest that this has no advantage over immediate mobilization. 
Increased fluid intake after the procedure also does not appear to decrease the risk of post-dural puncture headache. 
Before the provider leaves the room, the 4 tubes must be sealed and the needles and kit must be safely discarded.
Specimen tube labeling.
Each tube is labeled in the order of fluid collection. There is some variability to labeling, but cell count and differential are often repeated in the third or fourth tube, particularly if there is concern for a traumatic tap.
Tube #1 is for cell count and differential.
Tube #2 is usually for protein and glucose but may also include electrophoresis and other atypical proteins (albumin, lactate, pH, lactate dehydrogenase).
Tube #3 is for microbiology, including aerobic and anaerobic cultures and sensitivities.
Tube #4 is for the repeat cell count and differential.
Fungal culture and cryptococcal antigen can be added to the culture tube.
Specialized viral cultures, such as viral PCR (eg, herpes simplex virus and enteroviruses), West Nile, and/or Creutzfeldt-Jakob, should be placed in a separate tube to avoid contamination; and acid-fast bacilli culture may be added to tube #3.
When a separate viral culture is necessary, the chemistries can be added to one of the cell count and differential tubes, as long as the tube contains enough fluid (>1.5 mL).
A procedure note should be completed, detailing the procedure itself, a description of the fluid, the quantity of fluid removed, and how well the patient tolerated the procedure. Any complications, comments regarding the possibility of a traumatic tap, and number of attempts should also be included.
Patients will usually remain in the ED until the preliminary results of the study are obtained. For a meningitis work-up, this includes the protein and glucose, as well as Gram stain, cell count, and differential. An evaluation for xanthochromia and completion of cell counts are required to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Complications
Cerebral Herniation
Cerebral herniation is perhaps the most devastating complication of LP and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is thought to occur due to pressure gradients that may be exacerbated by the removal of even small amounts of CSF by LP. The true incidence of this complication is low, possibly less than 2%, even in patients with evidence of intracranial mass effect. 
In addition to intracranial lesions with mass effect, Chiari malformation is a risk factor for cerebral herniation. 
The conditions for which an emergency LP is indicated themselves carry an increased risk of herniation. For example, some estimates of the risk of herniation in bacterial meningitis range from 5% to over 13%. 
Furthermore, the majority of patients with bacterial meningitis who suffer cerebral herniation do not have identifiable abnormalities on CT. 
It is important to note that normal imaging prior to LP does not mean that the procedure is without risk. This is particularly true in patients with bacterial meningitis who are showing signs of neurological deterioration. 
Spinal Hematoma
Spinal epidural hematoma after LP is rare and is usually associated with a bleeding diathesis, but it can occur in patients with no apparent increased risk of bleeding. Case reports also exist of spinal epidural CSF collections developing after LP. 
Patients with suspected spinal hematoma after an LP require immediate magnetic resonance imaging for further evaluation.
Surgical management may be required and should not be delayed, because the neurological dysfunction can become permanent.
Iatrogenic Infection
Spinal abscess, discitis, arachnoiditis, and meningitis are rare complications of LP.
Case reports have linked iatrogenic infection with lapses in aseptic technique, but some cases are thought to be related to pre-existing infections, such as a case of bacterial meningitis in which the spillage of infected CSF seeded a secondary abscess. 
Cases of discitis have been reported after LP and spinal anesthesia. Discitis can develop weeks after the inciting event and is thought to be related to puncture of the annulus fibrosis during the procedure. 
Post-LP arachnoiditis can vary in presentation, mimic epidural abscess, or develop years after the procedure. 
Post-dural Puncture Headache
Post-dural puncture headache is one of the most common complications, occurring in 10%-30% of LP cases, usually within 72 h of the procedure. 
Although the precise cause is unclear, it is thought to be related to CSF leakage through the dural hole made by the needle.
The diagnosis is made clinically, with a headache that worsens upon sitting or standing and subsides while lying down. Up to 70% of post-dural puncture headache cases may have associated symptoms (nausea, neck stiffness, lower back pain, vertigo, visual changes, dizziness, or auditory changes) as well. 
Although post-dural puncture headache is self-limited and usually lasts a couple of days, it can continue for 10-14 d.
Patient risk factors identified in various studies include female gender, pregnancy, history of headaches, young adult age (18-50 y), low opening pressure, and thin body habitus. 
Procedural risk factors include the use of a cutting (Quincke) needle or a larger needle, orienting the bevel of the cutting needle perpendicular to the spine, and failing to reinsert the stylet before needle removal. 
Treatment
Initial (first 48 h) recommended therapy includes rest and hydration.
Medications that may be useful include  
Analgesics
Caffeine 300-500 mg intravenous (IV)/orally (PO)
Gabapentin 300 mg PO q8h
Hydrocortisone 100-200 mg IV, then 100 mg IV q8h for 48 h
Theophylline 250-400 mg PO q8h
Neostigmine 0.02 mg/kg IV plus atropine 0.01 mg/kg IV.
Epidural blood patch by an anesthesiologist is considered the definitive treatment. 
Local Back Pain
Localized pain during and after an LP is very common but usually mild.
Pain during the procedure should be minimized by using appropriately placed and ample local anesthetic such as 1% lidocaine.
The number of LP attempts is arguably the most significant risk factor for localized back pain after the procedure. 
Worsening or persistent back pain and neurological symptoms after LP should raise suspicion for more serious complications, such as spinal epidural hematoma.
Intraspinal Epidermoid Tumor
Intraspinal epidermoid tumors are rare and can occur congenitally or can be acquired.
Acquired epidermoid tumors account for up to 40% of these lesions. They are a late complication of LP, trauma, or other procedures and require anywhere from 2 to 23 y to develop. 
The risk of these tumors as a result of LP is thought to be greatest in the pediatric population. The incidence of this complication has dropped dramatically with the introduction and use of smaller-bore and styletted needles. ",Lumbar Puncture
"Rapid Access
Indications
Pericardiocentesis is the removal of pericardial fluid through needle aspiration.
Pericardiocentesis is performed urgently in cases of obstructive shock due to pericardial tamponade. Image
Removal of pericardial fluid in a hemodynamically unstable patient restores ventricular filling and improves cardiac output.
PEARLS
There are no absolute contraindications to this procedure, as pericardial tamponade can deteriorate into cardiac arrest.
Aortic dissection and cardiac free wall rupture are relative contraindications to pericardiocentesis, given the need for definitive surgical repair.
If a patient with dissection or free wall rupture is in cardiac arrest secondary to tamponade, drainage of the hemopericardium can be attempted as a temporizing measure to surgery.
PITFALLS
In general, pericardiocentesis is not performed in cases of traumatic hemopericardium; resuscitative thoracotomy should be considered in these cases.

Rapid sequence intubation medications (eg, induction and paralytic)
Vasopressor medications (eg, norepinephrine)
Technique/Intervention
Blind Approach
Position the patient supine.
Use the subxiphoid approach.
Clean the area and inject 2.5-5 mL of lidocaine 1% with epinephrine to create a wheal over the needle insertion area, if patient is not in cardiac arrest.
Place an 18-gauge spinal needle on the 20-mL syringe.
Insert the needle 1 cm inferior to the junction between the left costal arch and xiphoid process.
Angle the needle between 15° and 30°, aiming toward the left shoulder.
A medial or steep entry carries a risk of right atrial or intra-abdominal puncture.
Slowly advance the needle with continual aspiration until fluid is obtained.
Redirection, using an anterior-to-posterior motion, may be required if no fluid is aspirated.
Needle redirection in the lateral plane (ie, side-to-side motion) can lead to tissue laceration.
Aspirate enough fluid to achieve clinical improvement.
Ultrasound-Guided Approach
Position the patient to obtain the maximal fluid collection.
Utilize ultrasound to find the ideal window, corresponding to the largest unobstructed fluid collection closest to the skin.
Evaluate three windows: Subxiphoid, apical, and parasternal. Image
If the patient is repositioned, new images must be obtained to ensure that the fluid collection has not changed.
Clean the area and inject 2.5-5 mL of lidocaine 1% with epinephrine to create a wheal over the initial needle insertion area.
Place an 18-gauge spinal needle on the 20-mL syringe.
Insert the needle at the location chosen by ultrasound.
Slowly advance the needle with continual aspiration until fluid is obtained.
Ultrasound can be utilized to confirm the position of the needle tip in the pericardial space.
With a three-way stopcock, agitate saline and air between two syringes and then rapidly inject the saline with bubbles through the needle while visualizing with ultrasound; visualizing echogenic saline bubbles within the pericardium confirms proper location of the needle tip.
Aspirate enough fluid to achieve clinical improvement.
Stabilize the needle with one hand and remove the syringe with the other hand.
Advance a J-tipped guidewire through the finder needle.
The guidewire must be continually held in one hand throughout the duration of the procedure to ensure that there is no internal migration/loss (this should be observed for all steps listed below).
Remove the needle.
Insert the dilator over the guidewire.
Dilate the level of skin/subcutaneous (SC) tissue for ease of pigtail insertion.
The dilator does not need to be fully inserted.
Remove the dilator.
Place the pigtail catheter over the guidewire.
Remove the guidewire and secure the pigtail catheter to the skin.
Post-Procedure
Consult Cardiology or Thoracic Surgery for definitive management.
Obtain a chest radiograph to ensure that there is no pneumothorax.
Repeat echocardiography to demonstrate improvement in ventricular filling.",Pericardiocentesis
"Deep Dive
Background
Pericardial effusion is an accumulation of fluid between the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium and can result in reduced cardiac filling and output.
Cardiac tamponade can be fatal if not promptly recognized and treated.
The intact pericardium aids in establishing a normal right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (compliance) that prevents overexpansion of the right ventricle in response to volume loading. The pericardium also influences the filling pressures in both ventricles and facilitates ventricular interdependence.
Like a balloon, the pericardium can stretch with increasing fluid until its stretching ability is exceeded. Subsequently, the intrapericardial pressure increases, causing an equalization between the diastolic pressure and pericardial pressure.
PEARLS
Importantly, in cardiac tamponade, the rate of fluid accumulation determines the extent of impairment and the subsequent severity of clinical presentation.
PITFALLS
Pericardiocentesis is associated with worse outcomes (50% morbidity and 6% mortality) when performed via the blind subxiphoid approach. 
Imaging (fluoroscopic or ultrasound)-guided pericardiocentesis has been shown to be safer and is the preferred technique. 
Fluoroscopy, the initial imaging modality utilized for pericardiocentesis, allows for continuous visualization of the needle during the procedure.
Requires a cardiac catheterization laboratory
Only performed through the subxiphoid approach
Exposes both the patient and physician to radiation
The application of real-time ultrasound for pericardiocentesis has been well described.
The static approach to drainage was first described at the Mayo Clinic, where the operator visualized the optimal needle trajectory and then blindly advanced the needle.
An ultrasound-guided approach permits continuous monitoring during the procedure.
Ultrasound is widely available, portable, non-radiating, and relatively inexpensive.
Effusions are often not circumferentially distributed; thus, ultrasound can be utilized to identify the largest pocket of fluid.
Ultrasound has a higher success rate and fewer complications than the blind approach.
Ultrasound can identify the largest fluid collection and adjacent structures (eg, lung, vasculature, viscous).
Three approaches to ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis can be utilized:
Subxiphoid, apical, or parasternal windows can be used.
Static ultrasound images can identify the ideal route prior to the procedure.
Dynamic real-time images can monitor the needle entering the pericardial space.
Indications and Special Considerations
Patients in extremis/hemodynamic instability with a pericardial effusion warrant immediate drainage unless a clear alternate source of cardiovascular collapse is evident.
A three-step scoring system (ie, signs/symptoms, etiology of effusion, ultrasound findings) has been suggested for patients with suspicion for tamponade to determine whether the need for pericardiocentesis is urgent or emergent in nature. 
Ultrasound findings suggestive of tamponade include:  Image
Right atrial collapse for greater than 1/3 of the cardiac cycle (100% sensitivity)
Early right ventricular diastolic collapse (90% specificity)
Plethoric inferior vena cava without respirophasic variation
Pulsed-wave Doppler inspiratory reductions across the mitral and tricuspid valves greater than 25% and 40%, respectively
PITFALLS
Hypotensive patients should be treated with small fluid boluses (eg, 250-500 mL).
Use caution with large-volume infusions, given the potential to further increase the intrapericardial pressure and reduce cardiac output.
Consider administering adjunctive norepinephrine in addition to smaller aliquots of fluid while preparing for pericardiocentesis.

Place an 18-gauge spinal needle on the 20-mL syringe.
PEARLS
Insert needle at the location chosen by ultrasound.
Subxiphoid: Needle insertion should occur between the left costal arch and xiphisternum at a 15-30° angle directed toward the left shoulder. Although the liver may be traversed, this approach carries the lowest risk of pneumothorax.
An excessively steep angle risks entering the abdominal cavity.
An excessively medial entry risks right atrial puncture.
Apical: Needle insertion should occur 1 cm lateral to the apex within the fifth, sixth, or seventh intercostal space.
Risk is highest for ventricular puncture.
Risk of pneumothorax arises due to proximity to the pleural space.
Parasternal: Needle insertion should occur at the left fifth intercostal space adjacent to the sternal margin (at the level of the lung/cardiac notch) and perpendicular to the skin.
Risk is highest for puncture of thoracic vessels.
This approach has a risk of pneumothorax.
Slowly advance the needle with continual aspiration until fluid is obtained.
Ultrasound can be utilized to confirm the needle tip.
Confirm the location of the needle tip in the pericardial space.

Place a sterile cover over the drain.
Open the drain/stopcock as needed to drain fluid.
Post-Procedural Care
Following needle aspiration or pericardial catheter placement, a chest radiograph should be obtained to ensure that there is no pneumothorax.
After the initial pericardial drainage, further fluid aspiration may be required every 4-6 hours.
Earlier drainage is indicated if there are signs of hemodynamic deterioration.
Frequent aspirations greatly reduce the risk of fluid recurrence.
Pericardial catheters are typically removed several days after placement, when drainage has decreased to less than 25-30 mL per day.
In the event of a failed pericardiocentesis, a pericardial window by subxiphoid incision or left video-assisted thoracoscopic approach may be required.
Both methods require general anesthesia.
Failure may occur in loculated, recurrent, or neoplastic effusions.
There is no difference in mortality between pericardiocentesis and pericardial window, but pericardiocentesis does have a higher rate of fluid re-accumulation.
Malignancy-associated effusions have a high recurrence rate of approximately 60%. 
With the addition of balloon pericardiotomy, these re-accumulation rates drop to approximately 20%. 
Complications
Despite ultrasound guidance, complications are possible, as with any invasive procedure. Table
Pericardial decompression syndrome can occur either immediately after or within 48 hours of pericardiocentesis.
In patients with pericardial decompression syndrome, 40% develop left ventricular failure, 20% develop biventricular failure, and 9% develop right ventricular failure. 
Mortality rates as high as 30% have been reported. 
It is thought that rapid expansion of the right heart further diminishes left-sided filling.
When coupled with low systemic vascular resistance secondary to a cytokine-mediated inflammatory response, this condition may contribute to further hypotension and myocardial stunning.",Pericardiocentesis

Indications
Procedural sedation describes medications given to attenuate anxiety or pain and to improve compliance with and tolerance of a specific procedure. 
It is typically used for situations in which the patient is expected to maintain cardiovascular stability during a procedure.
In critically ill or unstable patients, it is generally preferable to manage the patient’s airway and resuscitate the patient to the best possible perfusion state for their condition before performing procedural sedation.
Equipment
Procedural sedation should be performed in an area with oxygen, suction, physiologic monitoring equipment, resuscitation medications, and age-appropriate equipment for airway and ventilatory rescue.
Airway cart equipment for procedural sedation:
laryngoscope
endotracheal tube with stylet
gum-elastic bougie
laryngeal mask airway
nasal airway
oral airway
bag-valve mask
Procedural Sedation Monitoring Photo
When opioids or benzodiazepines are the principal sedatives used for procedural sedation, corresponding reversal agents should be at the bedside.
Drugs to treat allergic reactions, nausea and vomiting, and recovery agitation should be available.
Preparation
Urgency and Risk Assessment
The urgency of the procedure for which the patient will be sedated and the patient’s risk for an adverse event from procedural sedation must be considered when determining the patient’s needs and the optimal agent and depth of sedation.

The risk from recent oral intake must be balanced with the urgency of the procedure.
PERSPECTIVES
Consider using ketamine in patients at high risk of aspiration for whom the procedure cannot be delayed, as this agent has not been associated with aspiration. 
For non-emergency procedures, consent should be obtained from the patient for the procedure after the optimal sedation approach has been determined.

"Deep Dive
Background
Pain
Untreated pain can lead to long-term increases in pain symptoms and other negative physiological effects. 
Painful experiences lead to future procedural fear.
The physiologic stress of untreated pain from brief procedures seems to be of lesser magnitude than respiratory distress from over-sedation, leading to a major decision point regarding the optimal depth of sedation.  It is very likely that the stress from over-sedation and respiratory depression is greater than that of unrecalled pain. Therefore, the optimal sedation level results in amnesia without any respiratory depression, which can generally be achieved with moderate sedation. Deeper levels of sedation are only necessary for procedures that require greater patient compliance than can be achieved with moderate sedation.

Many procedures, such as fracture reductions, require varying degrees of patient compliance to be successful. Generally speaking, the deeper the level of sedation, the more compliant the patient.
Recall
For brief painful procedures, lack of recall is often sufficient to achieve successful procedural sedation from the patient’s perspective. Studies have shown that unperceived pain leads to negative physiological effects, but these studies all involved prolonged painful procedures in the operating room. The negative consequences of unrecalled brief procedures have not shown similar effects. 
Procedural Risk
The need for pain control, compliance, and amnesia must be balanced against the patient’s risk of an adverse event. 
In general, the risk of an adverse event increases with the depth and duration of the sedation procedure. 
The patient’s baseline risk increases with a variety of factors, including age >65 or <2 y, obesity, pregnancy, the content and timing of their last meal, an abnormal baseline mental status, intoxication, and, most importantly, an unstable baseline medical condition. 
To determine the best level of sedation for a patient and the specific procedure required, the patient’s risk must be balanced with their procedural needs.
The longer the procedure, the higher the risk for an adverse event (as there is more time for such events to occur).
PITFALLS
The deeper the level of sedation, the higher the risk of an adverse event.
If amnesia and compliance with a painful procedure are needed and the patient is at low risk, deep sedation may be optimal.
For a high-risk patient, it may be in their best interest to achieve a lighter level of sedation at the risk of patient recall or insufficient procedural compliance.
In general, the safest approach is to choose the lightest level of sedation that is sufficient to perform the procedure and to err on the side of under-sedation and resulting compliance and recall problems if the patient is at high risk of an adverse event.
Indications and Special Considerations
Indications
Anticipated brief, painful event or procedure
Benefits that are likely to outweigh the risks of the procedure
Physical Status
The ASA Physical Status score is a 1-5 measure of procedural risk: 
Physical Status 1: A normal healthy patient
Physical Status 2: A patient with mild systemic disease
Physical Status 3: A patient with severe systemic disease
Physical Status 4: A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat
Physical Status 5: A moribund patient who is not expected to survive
Physical Status 6: A brain-dead patient whose organs may be donated
Physical Status 1 and 2 patients generally tolerate procedural sedation.
Physical Status 3 patients are at higher risk of adverse events, and agents that are not associated with hypotension are likely to be safer. 
Procedural sedation is not usually indicated in Status 4 or 5 patients.
Aspiration Risk
Aspiration is a risk in every procedural sedation. 
Time since the last meal is the most commonly recognized risk factor for aspiration.
Clear liquids constitute the lowest risk.
The density and size of the meal affect the time needed for clearance.
PEARLS
There is no clear timing guideline for eliminating the risk.
A variety of conditions increase the risk of aspiration:
Pregnancy
Autism
Intoxication
There are several ways to minimize the risk of aspiration during procedural sedation.
Delay non-urgent procedures in patients who have recently eaten a meal comprising more than clear liquids.
In patients with an urgent need for sedation who have recently eaten, choose the lightest and shortest possible sedation plan necessary to complete the procedure.
Maintain interactive monitoring throughout the procedure in order to
Avoid further sedatives in patients who are at their target sedation level.
Stimulate the patient if their level of sedation becomes deeper than intended.
Provide supportive airway measures if the patient becomes over-sedated and develops respiratory depression.
If a patient aspirates during a procedure, supportive measures should include the following:
Discontinuing the sedation procedure.
Clearing the patient’s airway:
Lateral and upright positioning
Suction
Airway and ventilation support as needed
Administering reversal agents if appropriate.
Special Considerations
Children
Children often require larger doses of sedatives than adults. This is due to a variety of factors, including the fact that children usually have a lower amount of body fat than adults. The dosing guidelines are determined for adults.
Amnesia may be more important in children due to the development of procedural fear from recalled painful procedures.
Elderly
PEARLS
Elderly patients often require smaller sedative doses.
The duration of action of sedatives is often prolonged in the elderly.
Adverse events are more common in elderly patients.
Obese Patients
When procedural sedation medications are dosed by weight, higher peak plasma concentrations can occur in obese patients than in those with a more typical weight.
PEARLS
Established weight-based dosing guidelines are based on patients with typical body fat percentages. As a patient’s body fat increases, the dose needs to be adjusted.
For propofol, a good estimation is 1 mg/kg of ideal body weight, plus one-third of the dose for the rest of the patient’s weight.
Sedation of the Critically Ill
Hypotension from sedation occurs more frequently. 
Respiratory depression occurs more frequently.
Intubation and general anesthesia are often safer than procedural sedation and should be considered in critically ill patients.
PEARLS
Patients should be resuscitated to the best possible perfusion state before starting procedural sedation. 
Technique
The risk of adverse events increases with the depth and duration of sedation.
Minimal sedation
Patients undergoing minimal sedation remain responsive to voice, with their eyes open, and can follow simple commands throughout the procedure. This level is not typically associated with procedural amnesia and is sometimes referred to as “anxiolysis.”
Moderate sedation
In patients undergoing moderate sedation, the eyes may close but will open to light touch (a glabellar tap) or voice. They will respond to painful procedures. Procedural sedation at this level is often associated with amnesia. This level is sometimes referred to as “conscious sedation.”
Dissociative sedation
Patients undergoing dissociative sedation with ketamine often have their eyes open throughout the procedure but are unable to follow commands and have inconsistent responses to touch and voice, making this neither moderate nor deep sedation. Dissociative sedation is typically associated with amnesia.
Deep sedation
Patients undergoing deep sedation have their eyes closed and do not respond to pain or light touch. They do respond to painful stimuli, including the procedure, but usually with better compliance than moderately sedated patients. Sedation at this level is associated with amnesia, similar to moderate sedation.
Altered Mental Status Scale
Altered Mental Status Scale to evaluate cognition Table
This is a commonly used scale to describe patients undergoing procedural sedation.  There are a variety of sedation scales in use and most work similarly well, assuming that all personnel involved in the procedure are familiar with the scale used.
Provider Training
Minimal sedation is often performed by providers with no specific training in procedural sedation.
Moderate sedation is commonly performed by many providers and usually requires specific credentialing. Training typically includes familiarity with a hospital’s sedation policy and specific guidelines meant to avoid inadvertent over-sedation. Providers performing moderate sedation should be familiar with basic supportive airway maneuvers and the drugs used in the sedation.
Deep sedation is typically a credentialed procedure that requires specific training. This training is a component of the standard training of every board-certified emergency physician.  Providers performing deep sedation should also be trained in definitive airway management.
Safety Monitoring
The primary goal of monitoring during procedural sedation is to detect changes that may be associated with adverse events, to facilitate supportive interventions, and to avoid the administration of further sedatives around the time of an impending adverse event.
Interactive Monitoring
Designated monitoring personnel visually monitor a patient during a sedation procedure. Interactive monitoring is superior to mechanical monitoring and is the most important safety monitor of any sedation. Mechanical monitors can serve to support interactive monitoring but can never replace it.
Respiration and ventilation:
Visual inspection of respiratory efforts
Visual inspection for airway obstruction
Relative skin temperature
When a patient becomes apneic or hypoventilatory, partial pressure of CO2 increases. This causes vasodilation, which makes the patient’s skin feel warm. This can be a subtle early sign of declining respiratory status if monitored closely.
When a patient aspirates, they often increase their respiratory rate to maintain oxygenation. This results in a decrease in partial pressure of CO2, causing vasoconstriction, which makes the skin feel cool. This can be a subtle sign of aspiration during a procedure if monitored closely.
Level of consciousness
Patients should be continually monitored for their level of sedation. At lighter levels, this can be done using the patient’s response to voice. As the patient becomes unresponsive, this can be evaluated using light touch (a glabellar tap) during moderate sedation and painful stimuli during deep sedation.
Response to voice
Generally regarded as a response to normal speaking tones.
Light touch
The glabellar tap, which is 2 fingers to the central forehead, allows for a standard approach to define the limit of moderate sedation.
Painful stimuli
Pressure to the posterior mandible just below the ear is a consistent painful stimulus that can be used to define the limit of deep sedation. This painful pressure point is also useful for inducing respirations in patients who become apneic during sedation.
Mechanical Monitoring
Cardiac Monitor
PEARLS
These are typically used in sedation but are generally not sensitive to the changes associated with impending adverse events. Tachycardia is sometimes present prior to adverse events but also frequently occurs during sedation due to procedural pain; thus, tachycardia is an insensitive sign.
Blood Pressure
Changes in blood pressure are common during procedural sedation, and hypotension is one of the most common adverse effects of sedatives. Hypotension during procedural sedation can usually be reversed by withholding further sedative and administering a fluid bolus.
Pulse Oximetry
Pulse oximetry is useful during procedural sedation. Although the effect of brief periods of hypoxia is not well described, it is thought to cause stress to the patient, at the least.  Patients placed on supplemental oxygen are less likely to develop hypoxia.  However, this also makes the monitor less useful for detecting respiratory depression.
Capnography
Capnography is a sensitive monitor of a patient’s respiratory effort and airway patency. 
The end-tidal CO2 waveform on the capnograph demonstrates the patient’s respirations. This waveform allows for a relative measure of the patient’s depth of respiration and its change over time, assisting the interactive monitor in accurately assessing the patient’s breathing.
The monitor quickly detects apnea when the waveform is no longer present.
Large decreases in end-tidal CO2 are usually signs of airway obstruction. The airway obstruction causes increased mixing of expired air with room air, causing an artificial lowering of the end-tidal CO2 that can be used to help the interactive monitor detect obstruction.
PEARLS
Increases in end-tidal CO2 can be subtle indicators of hypoventilation and over-sedation.
Pre-procedural Pain Management
PEARLS
Patients should be treated for their pain before procedural sedation begins.
This can be done with a variety of agents:
For moderate or severe pain, opioids can be titrated until the patient is comfortable.
The sedation procedure should not begin until the peak effect of any titrated pain medications has passed.
Supplemental opioids given during procedural sedation have been shown to increase the risk of adverse events without clear benefit to the patient. 
Agents
The Procedural Sedation Agents table provides an overview of common procedural sedation agents Table.
Propofol
This is a commonly used agent for moderate and deep sedation and has been established as one of the safest agents for procedural sedation in the emergency department. Although it is used for both moderate and deep sedation, it is difficult to predict precisely which level will be achieved in brief sedation procedures, and propofol should typically be considered a deep sedation agent even when used for moderate sedation. 
Ketamine
This is a commonly used agent for dissociative sedation. Compared with propofol, it is associated with less hypotension but a similar rate of respiratory depression.  It is likely superior to propofol for the sedation of patients who have an unstable concurrent condition or are at risk of hypotension, including all patients who are ASA Physical Status 3. 
Etomidate
Etomidate produces a deep sedation similar to that of propofol but with less hypotension. Its principal drawback is that it is associated with myoclonic jerking in up to 35% of sedations, which can complicate the procedure for which the patient is being sedated. It is superior to propofol in patients at risk of hypotension. 
Opioids
Opioids can be used for minimal sedation. Generally, they are associated with too much respiratory depression to be used effectively for moderate or deep sedation. 
Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are typically used for minimal sedation. They can be combined with opioids for moderate or deep sedation, but this combination is associated with more adverse events than the other agents described here and is not generally recommended. 
Other Agents
Ketofol is a combination of ketamine and propofol at propofol-to-ketamine ratios ranging from 1:1 to 4:1. The 1:1 combination has been shown to have a longer duration than the 4:1 combination or propofol alone and is associated with a lower incidence of hypotension, making this a promising sedation option in patients at risk of hypoperfusion during the procedure. 
Reversal and Rescue Agents
These are competitive antagonists that can be used in the case of adverse events to reverse sedative effects not resolving with simple stimulation. Reversal agents should not be routinely used to reverse sedation at the end of the procedure. It is more effective to choose agents with durations of effect similar to the anticipated length of the procedure.
Competitive antagonists often have a shorter duration of action than the agents they reverse, and patients must therefore be closely monitored for recurrence of their over-sedation.
Flumazenil reverses benzodiazepines and is generally dosed at 0.1-0.2 mg every 1 min until the patient is sufficiently reversed. Recommended maximum total dose is 1 mg. Flumazenil peak effect occurs at 5-10 min, and its duration of action is 30-90 min.
Naloxone reverses opioids and is generally dosed at 0.1-0.2 mg IV every 1 min as needed for partial reversal and 1-2 mg for complete reversal. Its peak effect is at 1 min after dosing, and its clinical effect lasts 15-30 min.
Post-procedural Care
Patients should be monitored until they regain their baseline mental status.
As a patient recovers from the sedation procedure, the frequency of monitoring can be decreased.
Patients should be continuously monitored until they respond to voice.
Once a patient responds to voice, interactive monitoring can become intermittent (every 1 min), but mechanical monitoring should continue.
It is very unlikely that the patient will experience an adverse event after they have regained their baseline mental status.
Complications
Respiratory Depression
This is a common complication and can occur at any time after a sedative is given. If detected early by interactive monitoring, it can typically be reversed by withholding further sedative medications, repositioning, and stimulating the patient to induce respirations. If these steps fail, assisted ventilation using a bag-valve mask can be applied. When short-acting sedatives are used, the period of respiratory depression is typically short, and the patient can be supported through the respiratory depression if detected early. In the case of longer-acting opioids or benzodiazepines, reversal agents should be used if the patient does not respond to repositioning or stimulation. 
Aspiration
This is a rare but serious complication. It can best be avoided by using the lightest level of sedation possible and by withholding further sedatives if the patient exhibits respiratory depression. When aspiration occurs, the patient’s airway should be cleared, and they should have their ventilation supported in order to maintain oxygenation. 
Pain and Recall
Patients typically display a response to pain during moderate and deep sedation that they do not subsequently recall. This does not require treatment. If a patient has recall of a painful procedure after the sedation, this can be treated with a low-dose benzodiazepine or opioid if tolerated by the patient. Pain and recall can be avoided by performing the painful procedure just prior to or during the peak effect of the sedative agent and by avoiding painful interventions in the final 2-3 min of sedation. Moderate-term memories are formed 2-3 min after an event occurs. If a patient is awake 2-3 min after a painful event, a memory can be formed if the event was perceived at the time it occurred. If a patient perceives a painful event but then remains sedated for more than 2-3 min after, they will typically not have any recall of the event. 
Recovery Agitation
Patients sometimes become agitated and confused during recovery. This is most commonly seen with ketamine but has been described for most agents. This can be avoided by keeping the patient in a quiet and non-stimulating environment while they are recovering from their sedation. If a patient develops recovery agitation that does not respond to verbal de-escalation, they can be effectively treated with a benzodiazepine. ",Procedural Sedation

Confirm the target at or above the fourth/fifth intercostal space (above the nipple line in males and the inframammary fold in females) along the anterior axillary line. Inject 2.5-5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine to create a wheal over the initial incision area.
PEARLS
Advance the needle and inject 5 mL 1% lidocaine with epinephrine into the subcutaneous (SC) tissues until bone is encountered. March the needle cephalad until it is over a rib, and advance the needle into the intrapleural space. Inject 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine into the pleural space and SC tissues as the needle is withdrawn.
Clamp the distal end of the chest tube.
Place a Kelly clamp on the proximal end of the chest tube to serve as a guide.
Using a #10 blade, make a 3- to 4-cm incision over and parallel to the rib.
Bluntly dissect using a Kelly clamp through the SC tissues until the intercostal muscles are reached. Gripping the clamps with the thumb and forefinger 1-2 cm from the tip and using the rib as a fulcrum, apply steady pressure to puncture into the pleural space over the rib (this will prevent the clamp from being advanced too far into the thoracic cavity).
Bluntly dissect to enlarge the opening. Ensure that the fascia over the rib is appropriately dissected to prevent the creation of a false track.
Insert a gloved finger into the pleural space and sweep 360° to ensure that there is no opposed lung or adhesions.

Inject 2.5-5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine to create a wheal, and then advance the needle and inject 5 mL into the SC tissues until a rib is encountered.
March the needle cephalad until it slides over the rib and, while aspirating, advance into the intrapleural space. Inject 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine anesthetic into the pleural space and SC tissues as the needle is withdrawn.
Set up the pigtail chest tube catheter by inserting an obturator into the chest tube. Place a cap over the side exit of the stopcock (if applicable).
Attach a syringe with a small amount of saline to a large finder needle and insert the needle into the same track while aspirating.
Once air/blood/fluid is encountered, detach the syringe and advance a wire through the needle. Take care to stop advancing the wire once resistance is encountered.
Remove the needle over the wire.
Using a #11 blade, make a skin nick parallel to the ribs to avoid the vascular bundle.
Advance the dilator using a twisting motion, frequently checking that the wire will slide freely through the dilator.
Pass the catheter with an obturator over the wire into the pleural space using a twisting motion.
Once the obturator is 1-2 cm into the pleural space (or when the first depth marking on the pigtail catheter is reached), hold the obturator and advance the catheter over the obturator to prevent parenchymal or mediastinal injury.
Remove the obturator and guidewire simultaneously while maintaining an appropriate pigtail catheter depth.
As soon as the obturator and guidewire are removed, turn the stopcock toward the patient to prevent the introduction of air.

Background
A tube thoracostomy is frequently performed in the Emergency Department (ED) for a variety of indications, including spontaneous pneumothorax, traumatic pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion, and empyema.
Emergency physicians need to be comfortable with performing an emergency tube thoracostomy as there is the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if intervention is delayed or inappropriately performed.
Considerations in the execution of this potentially life-saving procedure vary considerably and depend on the pathology.
Classically, a tube thoracostomy involves “open” or “surgical” chest tube placement using blunt dissection and large-bore (22-40 French) chest tubes.
Smaller bore 8-14 French pigtail catheters placed percutaneously using the Seldinger technique are the standard of care in the management of pneumothorax and simple effusions. A growing body of data supports the additional use of these tubes in cases of empyema and hemothorax, where they have been associated with a decreased rate of serious complications and infection. 
Larger-bore catheters up to 36 French are available for use via the Seldinger technique with serial dilation using trochars. These are not recommended as they have been associated with an increased incidence of malposition and serious injury. 
Advantages of using pigtail catheters include the familiarity of the Seldinger technique from central line placement, the opportunity to use ultrasound guidance, and the potential for decreased patient discomfort.
The optimal approach for pigtail catheter placement relies heavily on the indication for chest tube placement and must involve an appropriate assessment of the risks and benefits for the procedure, with competing considerations for each indication discussed below.
Indications and Special Considerations
Pneumothorax - Air in the Pleural Space Between the Visceral and Parietal Pleura
Primary spontaneous pneumothorax
Occurs without clinically apparent underlying lung disease or a preceding trauma
Has an incidence of approximately:
7 to 18 per 100,000 per year in men
1 to 6 per 100,000 per year in women 
Management options include observation with supplemental oxygen, needle aspiration, and tube thoracostomy. 
Decision-making should be guided by the etiology of the pneumothorax, the risk of its recurrence, the clinical stability of the patient, any need for positive pressure ventilation, and planned disposition.
PEARLS
A period of observation is reasonable in the setting of small pneumothoraces. However, larger pneumothoraces (≥2 cm measured between the lung and the chest wall at the level of the hilum or ≥3 cm from the lung apex to the ipsilateral thoracic cupola at the parietal surface measured using an upright standard radiograph) or those associated with shortness of breath have a significant failure rate and will likely need drainage. 
Simple aspiration is reasonable in stable patients with a pneumothorax <2 cm and a low risk for recurrence. Simple aspiration is performed using a long intravenous (IV) catheter with a three-way stopcock and a large syringe. 
For patients not suitable for observation or simple aspiration, including those that require positive pressure ventilation, pigtail catheters have replaced chest tubes as first-line initial management due to the similar efficacy and decreased discomfort and complications encountered with pigtail catheters. 
Small studies have shown that the placement of pigtail catheters connected to one-way Heimlich valves permits safe discharge after a spontaneous pneumothorax. 
Larger-bore chest tubes still have a role in primary spontaneous pneumothorax if there is an ongoing and persistent air leak despite the use of a pigtail catheter, especially if the patient is on positive pressure ventilation, as inadequate evacuation of air by smaller-bore catheters can lead to a tension pneumothorax.
Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax
This condition occurs in the setting of a known underlying structural lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis, infection, connective tissue disease, or malignancy.
Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces have a high incidence of progression or recurrence; therefore, it is standard to admit these patients for observation. Aspiration or drainage with pigtail catheter placement is recommended in most cases. 
As in primary spontaneous pneumothoraces, if there is a risk of a large air leak, it may be necessary to place a larger-bore chest tube to adequately drain the pleural space.
Traumatic pneumothorax
Traumatic pneumothoraces can be divided into iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic.
Iatrogenic cases are most commonly the result of pulmonary procedures such as biopsy, thoracentesis, or misplaced internal jugular or subclavian central line access. These can be managed with observation, needle aspiration, or tube thoracostomy based on treatment criteria similar to those for a primary spontaneous pneumothorax.
More complicated iatrogenic cases (eg, esophageal perforation from dilation or a misplaced feeding tube in the pleural space) require placement of a pigtail catheter or chest tube in consultation with a specialist.
A non-iatrogenic traumatic pneumothorax can result from an underlying blunt visceral pleural injury or from an injury to the parietal pleura due to a fractured rib or penetrating foreign body.
If there is a high clinical suspicion for a large bronchopulmonary air leak or if there is a large concomitant hemothorax, a chest tube should be considered over a pigtail catheter.
Tension pneumothorax
This is an emergency condition that manifests with hemodynamic instability secondary to the displacement of mediastinal structures and a decreased cardiac preload.
Tension pneumothorax is ideally diagnosed on clinical exam (tracheal deviation, absent breath sounds, distended neck veins) or bedside ultrasound (absence of lung sliding) prior to X-ray imaging.
Needle decompression (second intercostal space, midclavicular line) has historically been taught as the initial temporary therapeutic intervention.
PEARLS
This anterior approach has a high failure rate that is dependent on catheter length, with one study reporting a significantly lower failure rate when a 4.5- vs. 3.2-cm catheter was used.  The 2019 Advanced Trauma Life Support update recommends a lateral approach in the “triangle of safety.” 
Although few studies have directly compared it to needle thoracostomy, finger thoracostomy provides another option for decompression, with high reported reliability in the prehospital setting. 
Pneumothorax ex vacuo
Air in the pleural space after a thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy secondary to a trapped lung that is unable to re-expand.
Not resolved by placement of a chest tube
Usually managed conservatively with observation because it does not affect hemodynamics or oxygenation.
Hemothorax
Rapid drainage of a suspected hemothorax from a blunt or penetrating injury is important, as an initial output >1.5 L, an output rate >150-200 mL/hour every hour for 4 hours, or a persistent need for blood transfusions is considered as an indication for an operating room thoracotomy to control bleeding. 
Complete evacuation of blood is important for reducing the risk of empyema formation and the sequelae of trapped lung and restrictive lung physiology. 
Large 36-40 French chest tubes have classically been used under the presumption that a larger internal diameter is necessary to avoid obstruction from clotted blood.
PEARLS
However, a 2012 study of 28-32 French chest tubes showed equivalent outcomes compared with larger-bore catheters, and current Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines now recommend 28-32 French chest tubes in the treatment of traumatic hemothorax. 
No randomized studies have evaluated pigtail catheters head-to-head with chest tubes. However, multiple prospective observational studies have shown that 14 French catheters are equally effective in the drainage of traumatic hemothorax/hemopneumothorax, with equivalent failure rates and complications. 
Pleural Effusion
Pleural effusions can be transudative, exudative, hemorrhagic, or chylous.
There are limited indications for tube thoracostomy in the treatment of pleural effusion in the ED, as characterization of pleural fluid is rarely an emergency and diagnostic studies can be obtained via thoracentesis.
In rare cases, acute large pleural effusions can cause a compressive atelectasis, which can lead to shunt physiology and hypoxemia. This condition can be managed by draining 500-1000 mL of fluid via aspiration or drain placement.
Small-bore pigtail catheters are recommended over chest tubes as the first-line option for draining all types of pleural effusions. 
PEARLS
Ultrasound can be useful in determining the location of the intercostal arteries prior to pigtail catheter insertion, especially if placement outside the typical “triangle of safety” is required, because the neurovascular bundles do not run as reliably close to the inferior rib margin at more posterior locations.
Empyema
Drainage of suspected empyemas in the ED can provide source control in critically ill patients.
Larger-bore chest tubes were classically used if an empyema was suspected in order to better drain the more viscous purulent fluid.
PEARLS
However, a prospective multicenter study demonstrated no significant difference in patient-centered clinical outcomes in patients with empyemas drained with pigtail catheters versus large-bore chest tubes. Additionally, the smaller catheters were associated with significantly less discomfort. 
The American Association for Thoracic Surgery and the British Thoracic Society recommendations in the management of empyema state that a “small bore” tube thoracostomy is preferred, with frequent flushing to prevent tube obstruction. 
Ultrasound can provide valuable information regarding the existence of loculations and can help guide proper tube placement. 
Technique
Chest tube placement EM:RAP Video
Position the patient supine at a 45° angle, if possible, to permit gravity to pull the diaphragm lower, thereby reducing the chance of diaphragmatic injury.
Identify the “triangle of safety,” Figure which is bordered anteriorly by the lateral edge of the pectoralis major, laterally by the lateral edge of the latissimus dorsi, inferiorly by the line of the fifth intercostal space, and superiorly by the base of the axilla.
Sanitize the skin with a topical antiseptic and allow it to dry completely.
Apply sterile drapes to create a large sterile field.
Confirm the target at or above the fourth/fifth intercostal space (above the nipple line in males and the inframammary fold in females) along the anterior axillary line.
Inject 2.5-5 mL 1% lidocaine with epinephrine to create a wheal. Advance the needle until bone is encountered while injecting an additional 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine into the SC tissue.
March the needle cephalad while aspirating until the needle slides over the rib and advances into the intrapleural space. Inject 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine into the pleural space and SC tissues as the needle is withdrawn.
Measure the distance from the insertion site to the apex/sternum to estimate the insertion depth.
Clamp the blunt end of the chest tube with a Kelly clamp to assist with insertion. Clamp the distal end of the chest tube transversely to prevent air entrainment and fluid leakage.
Using a #10 blade, make a 3- to 4-cm incision over and parallel to the rib.
Bluntly dissect through the SC tissues using a Kelly clamp until the intercostal muscles are reached. Grip the clamps using the thumb and forefinger 1-2 cm from the tip of the clamp and, using the rib as a fulcrum, apply steady pressure to puncture into the pleural space over the rib (this will prevent the tube from being advanced too far into the thoracic cavity). Be careful to avoid the inferior border of the rib, which is where the neurovascular bundle runs.
Open the Kelly clamp while in the pleural space and pull the clamp back through the incision to widen the pleural opening.
Insert a gloved finger and sweep 360° to ensure that there is no opposed lung and to break up any loculations.
While keeping the finger in the opening, insert the tube along the finger past the last drainage hole, angled posteriorly toward the lung apex (pneumothorax) or base (hemothorax).
Suture the chest tube in place EM:RAP Video using 0 silk to close the skin defect and to secure the tube. Tie the suture tightly to slightly indent the tube and to prevent future dislodgement.
Attach the tube to a chest drainage system. EM:RAP Video Some advocate cutting the distal end of the chest tube transversely before connecting.
Tape the tube connections using plastic tape.
Make a slit in several pieces of dry gauze using scissors. Apply petroleum gauze to the insertion site to form an airtight barrier. Cover this in dry gauze and pressure tape to prevent kinking of the tube and dislodgement.
Considerations when performing a tube thoracostomy in an obese patient: EM:RAP Video
Use positioning (45° upright, rolled slightly) and retraction with tape or an assistant to optimize access to the “triangle of safety.”
Use a sufficiently long needle for anesthetizing and for finding the pleural space.
Anesthetize widely and use a longer incision for access.
Consider using a bougie after accessing the space with a finger to facilitate proper tube placement, while exercising caution to avoid injury to the lung or mediastinal structures.
Percutaneous pigtail catheter placement Video
Position the patient for an optimal approach:
An anterior approach (second intercostal space, midclavicular line) is effective in the treatment of pneumothorax.
PERSPECTIVES
Identification of a lung point on ultrasound is specific for diagnosing pneumothorax and can help localize the best approach for pigtail catheter insertion.
If draining an effusion or empyema, use a phased-array or abdominal probe to localize an adequate pocket of fluid and place the pigtail catheter under active ultrasound guidance if possible. This practice has been shown to improve the success of thoracentesis compared with pre-procedure marking alone. 
Inject 2.5-5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine to create a wheal over the initial incision area; then, advance the needle and inject 5 mL into the SC tissues until bone is encountered.
March the needle cephalad until it is over the rib and advance it into the intrapleural space. Inject 10 mL of local anesthetic (e.g., 1% lidocaine with epinephrine) into the pleural space and SC tissues as the needle is withdrawn.
Set up the pigtail chest tube catheter by inserting an obturator into the chest tube. Place a cap over the side exit of the stopcock (if applicable).
Attach a syringe with a small amount of saline to a large finder needle and insert the needle through the same track just above the superior edge of the rib while aspirating.
Once air/blood/fluid is encountered, detach the syringe and pass a wire through the needle while angling the needle in the desired direction. Take care to stop once resistance is encountered. Remove the needle over the wire.
In patients with an effusion/empyema, confirm the desired wire trajectory on ultrasound.
PERSPECTIVES
Using a #11 blade, create a skin nick parallel to the rib to minimize the risk of injury to the neurovascular bundle. Advance the dilator in a twisting motion while frequently sliding the wire to ensure that the wire is moving freely and not kinking.
Pass the catheter with the obturator over the wire into the pleural space using a twisting motion, frequently checking that the wire will slide freely through the dilator.
Once the obturator is 1-2 cm into the pleural space (or when the first depth marking on the pigtail catheter is reached), hold the obturator and advance the catheter over the obturator to prevent parenchymal or mediastinal injury. Advance the catheter to the predetermined depth based on the external estimate.
Remove the obturator and guidewire simultaneously while maintaining an appropriate pigtail catheter depth.
As soon as the obturator and guidewire are removed, turn the stopcock toward the patient to prevent the introduction of air. Attach the syringe, aspirate the contents of the collection, and send the contents for sampling as indicated.
Suture the catheter in place using 0 to 2-0 silk by placing an anchor stitch in the skin and looping it around the catheter several times before tying it with sufficient force as to slightly indent the tubing.
Apply dry gauze under the tube as it exits the skin to prevent kinking. Apply clear adhesive dressing or chest tube tape over the insertion site and secure the more distal portion of the catheter to create a “leash” and to prevent dislodgement.
Connect the catheter to a chest drainage system or Heimlich valve and tape the connections. EM:RAP Video In case of an effusion or empyema, simple gravity drainage to water seal (instead of suction) is often preferred.
Post-procedural Care
Perform an anteroposterior (and lateral if feasible) CXR to confirm proper tube placement and to confirm the expected improvement in pneumothorax/effusion.
Ensure that the radiographic marker representing the sentinel hole (the most peripheral intake portal) is within the thoracic cavity.
Examine the chest drain system to ensure a proper setup.
Proper tidaling during respiration is seen on the chest drain system as the rising and falling of the float ball. Lack of tidaling can signify complete resolution of the pneumothorax or kinked/clogged tubing.
Persistent bubbling in the water seal chamber of the chest drain system suggests the presence of an intrathoracic air leak (eg, bronchopleural fistula) or a leak in the tubing connection.
PEARLS
Do not clamp the chest tube for transport, as this can lead to a build-up of air/fluid in the pleural space and may possibly create a tension physiology. Instead, set the system to water seal when suction is not available.
Air transport (especially fixed-wing transport due to higher altitudes) will increase the intrathoracic gas volume and can worsen a pneumothorax if the chest drain is not kept to suction or water seal.
Guidelines recommend against prophylactic antibiotics except in cases of trauma, where recent data suggest a decreased incidence of empyema and pneumonia. 
Complications
Tube thoracostomy has the potential for serious complications given its proximity to vital structures. The most commonly reported complications include injury to thoracic or abdominal structures, malposition, infection, and drain blockage, with the frequency of these complications depending on tube size and clinical setting. 
Persistent air leak
Air leaks are diagnosed by bubbling in the water seal chamber. This is expected early following the evacuation of a pneumothorax and should disappear once re-expansion is achieved.
An air leak can be intrathoracic (eg, from a bronchopleural fistula or air entrainment around the tube insertion) or extrathoracic (eg, the tube side-hole is outside the chest or there is a leak/hole in the tubing).
A large persistent inspiratory and expiratory air leak should raise suspicion for a bronchopleural or alveolar-pleural fistula.
Misplaced tube
SC: Remove and replace.
Intra-abdominal: Leave in place, immediately consult General Surgery.
Into the lung parenchyma: Leave in place, immediately consult Thoracic Surgery.
Deep tube placement (should not press against mediastinum): Safely withdraw and secure.
Shallow tube placement (side-hole outside of the chest): Remove and replace, as the external tubing is no longer sterile.
Bleeding
Hold pressure.
An uncontrolled intercostal artery or lung parenchymal bleed may require immediate interventional radiology treatment for embolization or an urgent thoracic surgery consult for immediate thoracotomy.
Re-expansion pulmonary edema
This is typically a benign process that is managed with observation and oxygen support.
PEARLS
Prolonged lung collapse, rapid re-expansion, and negative pleural pressure >20 cm H2O [-0.20 kPa] increase the risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema. 
PERSPECTIVES
Cessation of fluid removal when the patient coughs or limiting the output to 1-1.5 L can reduce the risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema.
Tube dislodgement/blockage
Use caution in “stripping” the tube, as this can generate significant negative pressure.",Thoracostomy

Quickly prep the skin of the entire chest wall.
Iodine is preferred; ChloraPrep is also acceptable.
Elevate and secure the patient’s left arm above the head.
Perform an anterolateral thoracotomy incision.
Start at the right side of the sternum at the fifth intercostal space.
Make a curved incision extending to the posterior axillary line under the nipple/breast.
Divide the intercostal muscle and anterior pleura with Metzenbaum scissors along the superior aspect of the rib to avoid injury to the neurovascular bundle.
PEARLS
Place a Finochietto retractor between the ribs (handle directed toward the axilla) and open the retractor using the hand crank, taking care not to trap the lung within the retractor.
The left lung will be in your field of view; displace the lung as best as possible to expose the pericardium.
Identify the phrenic nerve running through the lateral pericardium.
Using forceps or an Allis clamp, grasp the surface of the pericardium anterior to the phrenic nerve, and make a small incision or cut a small hole using Metzenbaum scissors.
PEARLS
Using scissors, cut the pericardium in a caudal direction to allow the heart to be delivered.
Evacuate any blood or clots noted within the pericardium to relieve any tamponade, and deliver the heart from the pericardial sac.
Quickly but thoroughly evaluate the heart for any injuries.
Extend the thoracotomy across the sternum into the right chest if there is suspected right hemithoracic injury or if better exposure is necessary.
Locate the descending aorta by tracking along the posterior ribs toward the spine and prepare to apply a cross clamp.
Perform internal cardiac massage for persistent arrest after delivery of the heart from the pericardium and in cases of repair of any myocardial injuries.
Inject intracardiac epinephrine through the myocardium and into the heart. This step can be repeated every 3-5 minutes per the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol.
If a return of spontaneous circulation is obtained, gently pack the thoracic cavity with sterile lap pads soaked in warm saline.
A rapid transfusion protocol (including red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma) is almost certainly needed at this point.

Background
ED thoracotomy was originally described as an access point for open cardiac massage in the treatment of cardiac arrest prior to 1960.
ED thoracotomy was the sole method of providing CPR until closed-chest CPR was described in 1960 by Kouwenhoven. 
In the United States, 9% of all trauma deaths are related to thoracic trauma, of which approximately one third are due to penetrating injuries. 
Indications and Special Considerations
ED thoracotomy, or “resuscitative thoracotomy,” is performed in a trauma patient in extremis with the hope that the source of injury can be rapidly identified and managed.
Given the invasiveness of the procedure, as well as the potential risks to both the patient and healthcare personnel, ED thoracotomy is a highly controversial procedure and is considered a last resort measure performed to preserve life.
The indications for ED thoracotomy are not absolute and remain debatable, as, even in the best trauma centers, survival is low.
PEARLS
The populations most likely to benefit from this procedure are those with injuries that can potentially be definitively and rapidly managed or at the very least temporized (eg, tamponade, penetrating wound to the heart, and hilar or pulmonary bleeding).
While therapeutic maneuvers in ED thoracotomy include open cardiac massage and cross-clamping of the aorta, these maneuvers are primarily supportive and may improve blood flow to vital organs (eg, brain, heart) and decrease persistent hemorrhage. This helps explain why other injury mechanisms (blunt trauma, extrathoracic penetrating trauma) are less likely to benefit from ED thoracotomy.
It is generally agreed that the potential benefits of ED thoracotomy outweigh the risks in trauma patients with refractory shock, including those who arrest in the trauma bay. The decision to perform ED thoracotomy in patients who arrest prior to arrival in the ED or trauma bay is less clear.
The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma has developed practice guidelines based on an extensive literature review.
A “strong” recommendation is given for ED thoracotomy in patients with penetrating trauma who present pulseless with signs of life.
“Conditional” recommendations are given for ED thoracotomy in patients with penetrating thoracic trauma who present pulseless without signs of life, patients with penetrating extrathoracic trauma who are pulseless with or without signs of life, and blunt trauma patients who present pulseless with signs of life.
PITFALLS
These guidelines recommend against the use of ED thoracotomy in patients with blunt trauma who are pulseless without signs of life on arrival. 
The Western Trauma Association recommendations for ED thoracotomy are similar to those of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and are only distinguished by the addition of CPR duration guidelines in patients without signs of life, after which an ED thoracotomy is no longer indicated. 
CPR for penetrating trauma <15 minutes
CPR for blunt trauma <10 minutes
The evidence for ED thoracotomy is only level II and III, as no randomized controlled trials have evaluated the procedure.
PEARLS
Importantly, cardiac electrical activity is considered a sign of life. Therefore, the current guidelines technically recommend ED thoracotomy for all patients presenting with pulseless electrical activity arrest, regardless of the mechanism of injury or CPR duration. Whether this is advisable in practice represents a controversial indication for ED thoracotomy. Under the current guidelines, there is a significant difference in the approach to ED thoracotomy for a patient in asystole compared to a patient with pulseless electrical activity.
Technique
Quickly prep the skin of the entire chest wall.
Iodine is preferred; ChloraPrep is also acceptable.
Elevate and secure the patient’s left arm above the head.
Perform an anterolateral thoracotomy incision.
Start at the right side of the sternum at the fifth intercostal space (inferior to the nipple in men or in the inframammary fold in women).
Make a curved incision extending to the posterior axillary line under the nipple/breast. Attempt to cut down to the rib to reduce dissection time.
PEARLS
Divide the intercostal muscle and anterior pleura with Metzenbaum scissors along the superior aspect of the rib to avoid injury to the neurovascular bundle. Once through the rib/pleura, place the index finger under the scissors and proceed posteriorly to avoid cutting the lung parenchyma.
PEARLS
Place the Finochietto retractor between the ribs (handle directed toward the axilla) and open the retractor, taking care to not trap the lung within the retractor.
Ribs are often broken during this step and can be very sharp. Maintain awareness to avoid self-injury.
The left lung will be in the field of view. Displace the lung as best as possible to expose the pericardium.
Identify the phrenic nerve, as it runs through the lateral pericardium.
Using forceps or an Allis clamp, grasp the surface of the pericardium anterior to the phrenic nerve and make a small incision or cut a small hole using the Metzenbaum scissors.
Be careful not to lacerate the underlying myocardium.
Using scissors, cut the pericardium in a caudal direction to allow the heart to be delivered.
The incision should be anterior and parallel to the nerve.
Pay attention to the location of the phrenic nerve, and avoid iatrogenic injury during this step.
Evacuate any blood or clots within the pericardium to relieve any tamponade.
Deliver the heart from the pericardial sac.
Quickly and thoroughly evaluate the heart for any injuries.
Ventricular injuries can be closed with a 2-0 prolene suture. Use a horizontal mattress suture.
Pay close attention to the coronary vessels while suturing ventricular injuries. Do not suture through or tie off any coronary vessels.
Large ventricular injuries can also be quickly and temporarily fixed with staples.
Atrial injuries can be sutured with 3-0 prolene. A Satinsky clamp (or other vascular clamp) can be used to achieve brief hemostasis during the repair. Use a horizontal mattress suture technique.
Extend the thoracotomy across the sternum into the right chest if there is suspected right hemithoracic injury or if better exposure is necessary.
Use bone cutters or a Lebsche knife.
As a result of an extended thoracotomy incision, internal mammary arterial bleeding will occur and will need to be controlled.
Aortic cross-clamping can be performed for control of massive hemorrhage from distal thoracic or intra-abdominal injuries.
Retract the lung anteriorly and caudally.
Locate the descending aorta by tracking a hand against the posterior chest wall toward the spine. The aorta lies anteriorly to the spine.
With a finger, dissect to expose and free the aorta from the esophagus.
Place the aorta between two fingers, slide the aortic cross clamp around the aorta, and clamp.
If the provider cannot confidently locate the aorta, manual pressure applied posteriorly against the spine can mimic the effect of a cross clamp.
Perform cardiac massage for persistent arrest after delivery of the heart from the pericardium and in cases of repair of any myocardial injuries.
Move the hands such that the palms are hinged at the apex of the heart and the hands come together with the fingertips last over the atria.
Inject intracardiac epinephrine through the myocardium and into the heart.
Repeat every 3-5 minutes if needed, per the ACLS protocol.
Use caution to avoid the coronary arteries when injecting.
Non-cardiac hemorrhage
Attempt to quickly locate the source of bleeding.
Manual pressure to great vessel injuries is often the most effective and efficient way to control bleeding while preparing the patient for the operating room.
Peripheral pulmonary bleeding in a single lobe or part of a lobe can be controlled with a vascular (Satinsky) clamp.
Significant hilar injuries with massive bleeding can be treated with a vascular clamp across the hilum or using a maneuver known as the “hilar twist.”
A sudden and significant increase in afterload occurs in the right heart in patients with a hilar clamp or twist, which requires immediate operative intervention.
If a return of spontaneous circulation is obtained, gently pack the thoracic cavity with sterile lap pads and soak in warm saline.
Patients who remain in asystole despite an ED thoracotomy, decompression of tamponade, and control of hemorrhage should be pronounced dead.
Ongoing hypotension despite the above maneuvers should be considered a sign of refractory shock and potential futility.
The decision to stop resuscitative efforts can be difficult and should take into account the overall low survival rate following ED thoracotomy.
Post-procedural Care
Once a return of spontaneous circulation is achieved, permissive hypotension (systolic blood pressure ~90 mm Hg) should be considered while the patient is being prepared for immediate transport to the operating room.
The chest should be lightly and gently packed with sterile lap pads and the cavity soaked in warm sterile saline.
Minimize crystalloid infusions.
Administer blood products with close observation of the heart, as volume overload can occur quickly when a cross clamp is applied to the aorta.
Be prepared with vasoactive or inotropic infusions.
Anticipate immediate transport to the operating room.
Massive transfusion protocol (red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma) is typically initiated.
Complications
ED thoracotomy is a dramatic procedure and is often performed in a chaotic environment, where there can be a significant risk of injury or occupational exposure to team members.
It is important to be aware of and minimize the following:
Presence of sharps in the field
Blood exposure
Fractured bones (ribs, sternum) that can be sharp and cause lacerations
Recent data suggest that donning proper personal protective equipment decreases the risk of occupational exposure. 
While extremely uncommon, viral transmission is possible due to occupational exposure. 
Internal mammary arteries must be ligated if the thoracotomy is continued across the sternum. Failure to ligate the internal mammary artery can result in persistent, uncontrolled hemorrhage.
Prolonged cross-clamping of the aorta can worsen acidosis by causing ischemia to tissues distal to the cross clamp, which can result in worse patient outcomes. 
Outcomes
Rhee and colleagues evaluated over 25 years of ED thoracotomy survival data and found an overall survival rate of 7.4%. ED thoracotomy for blunt trauma resulted in a 1.4% survival rate while ED thoracotomy for penetrating trauma resulted in a survival rate of 8.8%. 
Survival rates increase based on where signs of life are lost. The absence of any signs of life in the field corresponds to the worst survival rate (1.2%), followed by loss of signs of life during transport (8.9%). The highest survival rate for ED thoracotomy occurs when signs of life are observed in the hospital (11.5%).
Survival rates vary according to the mechanism of injury.
Stab wounds: 16.8%
Gunshot wounds: 4.3%
Blunt trauma: 1.4%
A recent review of the National Trauma Data Bank suggests that performing an ED thoracotomy on a patient >57 years old is associated with nearly 100% mortality, regardless of the mechanism of injury. 
PEARLS
Overall, the strongest predictor of outcome (survival and neurologically intact survival) is based on the mechanism of injury.
The decision to perform ED thoracotomy should be based on an understanding of the risks and benefits to the patient, provider, and healthcare staff and the support available in the event of a successful resuscitation.",Thoracotomy
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Treatment of a systemically ill patient with a diffuse blistering rash should begin with patient stabilization (ie, cardiopulmonary monitoring and IV access) and resuscitation (ie, crystalloids for hemodynamic instability and early goal-directed therapy for sepsis).
Obtain a thorough medication history, since it may suggest a drug-induced reaction.
Antibiotics should empirically cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and further toxin production, in the event of toxin-mediated disease.
Example: Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV or Linezolid 600 mg IV, plus
clindamycin 600-900 mg IV.
Suspicion for herpes simplex virus (HSV) or disseminated varicella zoster (VZV) warrants antiviral therapy;
Acyclovir 10 mg/kg/dose IV.
Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms (eg, altered mental status) require neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.
Hours are critical in the diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Appropriate treatment by a multidisciplinary team (ie, Dermatology, Burn Center, Surgery, Ophthalmology) has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality rates.
Key Concepts
First evaluate the distribution of the blistering rash.
Generalized, mucosal, localized, on sun-exposed areas or dependent location. Are the blisters grouped, dermatomal, or linear?
Check for speed of rash progression, fever, systemic symptoms, and multi-organ dysfunction.
Vesicles are <1 cm and bullae >1 cm in diameter.
Erythroderma is defined as extensive erythema, usually >90% of the skin surface and should always be considered an emergency.
Widespread blistering or desquamation warrants careful examination given the potential for significant morbidity.
Desquamation accompanied by erythroderma is particularly concerning.
Diffuse skin pain is a red flag, especially when it is out of proportion to the external findings.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Physical exam requires exposure of all of the patient’s skin.
A detailed medical history is essential in determining the inciting trigger or drug reaction.
Widespread desquamation must raise concern for SJS, TEN, or staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS).
Rapidly progressive desquamation, fever, hypotension, and end-organ injury are suggestive of SJS/TEN.
SSSS can happen at any age, including infancy; unlike SJS/TEN, the mucosal surfaces are spared. Careful assessment of the vermilion border aids in demarcation of mucosal involvement.
SSSS typically starts abruptly with diffuse erythema and fever followed by rapid progression of fragile blisters and exfoliation. Assessing for a primary infection is key in cases of SSSS.
A localized pattern of skin rash can assist in the diagnosis (ie, dermatomal, contact, dependent or a photo-exposed distribution).
HSV-1 or HSV-2 presents with vesicles clustered on an erythematous base and may be on the lips, genitals, face, chest (ie, herpes gladiatorum), finger (ie, herpetic whitlow), or over areas of atopic dermatitis (ie, eczema herpeticum).
Neonatal HSV should be considered if any vesicular lesions are noted in an infant up to 6 wk old.
Older patients with a blistering rash should prompt concern for bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris.
Treatment
Signs of shock (eg, cardiovascular instability, altered mental status) require source identification, control, and crystalloid resuscitation.
The degree of skin desquamation in SJS/TEN requires volume replenishment based on burn guidelines.
Apply non-adherent dressings and emollients to denuded skin to promote healing and reduce heat loss.
Supportive management includes care of pain, hydration, electrolytes, and nutrition.
A diffuse blistering rash in an ill-appearing patient warrants antibiotic coverage to include both MRSA (ie, vancomycin or linezolid) and toxin-mediated disease (ie, clindamycin).
Any potential inciting medication should be ceased or the trigger removed.
Wound cultures from conjunctiva, nares, throat, and lesions should be obtained.
If HSV/VZV is suspected, viral cultures/PCR should be obtained and antivirals administered.
A localized skin rash should be managed based on the suspected diagnosis.
Dermatology consultation can be obtained if the diagnosis is uncertain, especially if the patient is immunocompromised or has any other high-risk features.
Disposition
Admission
Admission is based on the degree of skin involvement, pain, systemic symptoms, and end-organ injury.
Localized rash in high-risk patients (eg, infants, elderly, pregnant women, and immunosuppressed patients) often warrants hospital retention.
Suspicion of SJS/TEN requires admission and possible transfer to a burn center.
ICU-level care is required for shock (eg, hemodynamic instability, CNS abnormalities) or multi-organ involvement.
Discharge
An immunocompetent patient with localized skin disease, without fever or other systemic symptoms, may be discharged with appropriate therapy and outpatient follow-up.",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)
Epidemiology
Overall, these are rare disorders. SJS has been described as affecting 5.3 children/million/year, while TEN/SJS overlap and TEN affect 0.8 and 0.4, respectively.  Occurs most often secondary to medications; 40% of cases occur in the setting of antibiotics.  Photo
Symptoms typically begin within 4 wk of starting a new medication (eg, antiepileptics, allopurinol, NSAIDs). Other common triggers are infections (eg, HSV, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], mycoplasma).
SJS/TEN can occur within a few days of initiating a new treatment and up to 8 wk later. A re-exposure to the same medication can trigger symptoms within a few hours.
Almost 30% of SJS/TEN cases never have an identified trigger. 
Mortality has been reported to be around 15%-50% with current treatments. TEN is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. 
There is a genetic predisposition associated with the disease. In certain cases, family members should be made aware to avoid the same medications.
Patients with HIV or malignancy are at a higher risk of developing SJS/TEN.
SJS/TEN is more common in women and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
Pathophysiology
SJS/TEN is a severe mucocutaneous reaction involving epidermal necrosis.
Skin necrosis can result in large areas of sloughing similar to burns. Mucous membranes are affected in over 90% of cases; these can be oral, nasal, ocular, or genital. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
SJS and TEN are differentiated by the severity of the disease. SJS typically involves <10% of the skin surface, while TEN involves >30%. The cases between 10% and 30% are classified as SJS/TEN overlap. Body surface area may be approximated using the rule of nines, as with burns.  Figure
SJS/TEN often starts with symptoms of fever and malaise. This can be mistaken for a viral syndrome, but the rapidly evolving skin changes easily differentiate it; influenza-like symptoms are followed by the development of target lesions with a purpuric center or erythema.
Patients may present with skin pain that is out of proportion to the external findings. 
Fever is common but may arise from general inflammation and not superinfection.
Patients are classically uncomfortable and ill-appearing.
The location of the lesions can result in specific manifestations:
Oral → Weeping and dehydration
Ocular → Purulent conjunctivitis
Respiratory → Coughing, dyspnea, and abnormal lung sounds
Gastrointestinal → Diarrhea
Genitourinary → Dysuria
Positive Nikolsky sign may be present (ie, pressure on intact lesions results in denuding of the skin or new blister formation).
The rash may have an erythematous, targetoid, annular, or purpuric appearance.
Large flaccid bullae and areas of denudation may also be present.
Extremities are less involved than the trunk; the rash may involve the palms and soles.
Laboratory Evaluation
Skin biopsy from the area adjacent to a bulla shows separation of the epidermis from the dermis, confirming the diagnosis.
Cultures (blood and urine), CMP, and CBC should be obtained in all patients. Leukopenia, anemia, atypical lymphocytes, eosinophilia, transaminitis, and/or hypoalbuminemia are common.
Electrolytes can be used to aid in prognostication (see below).
Two prediction tools have been created to aid in predicting mortality risk.  The SCORTEN and ABCD-10 scale are quite similar except that heart rate and electrolytes are omitted and dialysis is included in the latter score.
Age >40 y old
Bicarbonate <20 mmol/L
Cancer
Dialysis
10% total body surface area (TBSA)
Heart rate >120 bpm
Serum urea >10 mmol/L
Serum glucose >14 mmol/L
Therapeutic Considerations
It is imperative to remove the inciting medication.
All patients require hospital admission. SJS/TEN patients often require aggressive multi-disciplinary management, and consultation/transfer to a burn center is recommended.
SCORTEN or ABCD-10 may aid in determining which patients require transfer or treatment in an ICU.
There is limited evidence to guide management, and criteria have been based on case series/consensus criteria; thus, wide variability exists in SJS/TEN management. 
IV crystalloids should be administered to maintain a urine output of 0.5-1 mL/kg/h. Fluid losses are less extreme than after thermal burns.
Treatment with IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) appears to be the most widely accepted therapy. Some recommend systemic steroids, although there is conflicting evidence regarding their benefits. 
Newer identification of genetic markers and immune-mediated pathways of disease are prompting investigations into cyclosporine, infliximab, and plasmapheresis as possible therapies. 
Meticulous wound care with frequent dressing changes may improve outcomes by reducing infections. In addition, debridement of blisters and wound closure with synthetic and biological dressings may also improve outcomes. 
Sepsis is the leading cause of death. ",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS)
Photo Photo
Epidemiology
SSSS has been increasing in frequency, with the highest incidence in infants: 45.1 cases/million per year in U.S. infants <2 y old. 
Children usually do better overall, with 10% mortality vs. 40%-63% in adults. 
Pathophysiology
SSSS is a potentially life-threatening disorder and is most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus with toxin production that causes widespread epidermal damage and exfoliation.
Staph. aureus produces epidermolytic toxin A or B that acts as a protease targeting the epidermis.
Unlike with SJS/TEN, the injury to the epidermis is relatively superficial, which is why SSSS carries a better prognosis.
Disease occurs with delayed clearance of toxin by the kidneys. In children, this is likely from immature organs, but in adults, it is more often associated with renal disease or other comorbidities. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Patients are very uncomfortable, and infants are often irritable due to pain.
It usually starts abruptly with diffuse erythema and fever, rapidly progressing to fragile blisters and exfoliation.
Often, the blisters have ruptured by the time of evaluation. The affected skin may appear to be wrinkled with subsequent desquamation.
Skin folds are often first affected → Neck, axilla, and groin.
Mucous membranes are NOT typically involved, unlike in SJS/TEN.
Patients may develop conjunctivitis.
Positive Nikolsky sign is often present.
It is important to perform a full exam to identify a potential inciting infection.
Sepsis and pneumonia are the most concerning complications.
Laboratory Evaluation
Diagnosis is made clinically.
Blisters will be culture negative, because it is a toxin-mediated response; blood cultures rarely grow Staph. aureus.
Cultures should be obtained of any potential source of infection based on the medical history and physical exam (eg, throat or urine).
Skin biopsy is not routinely required and reveals much less necrosis than SJS/TEN.
Therapeutic Considerations
If the patient is systemically ill, treat both toxin production and MRSA with clindamycin and vancomycin, respectively. Nafcillin or oxacillin are the preferred agents for methicillin-susceptible Staph. aureus; however, since staphylococcus species are often penicillinase-resistant, the former therapy is recommended as first-line.
Dermatology consultation and admission is advised in patients with a large surface area exposure or signs/symptoms of systemic illness.
Healthy children with limited skin involvement may be appropriate for outpatient management with oral antibiotics and prompt follow-up.
Supportive care should not be forgotten; adequate analgesia, hydration/electrolyte therapy as needed, wound care, and nutritional supplementation.",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Varicella
Two distinct forms of the virus exist, as described below.
Varicella (Chicken Pox)
Photo Photo Photo
Epidemiology
The overall incidence of varicella decreased by 90% with a single vaccination. The current 2-dose regimen has further reduced the incidence of VZV. 
It is recommended that children receive their first dose of the vaccine at ~12-15 months, with the second around 4-6 y old.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The classic appearance is described as “dew drops on roses.” There is a generalized pruritic rash preceded by a fever and malaise. Vesicles are usually 1-3 mm and eventually crust over. A patient should have multiple lesions in different stages of development, unlike measles. They often start as macules and papules before turning into the fluid-filled vesicles.
With broad vaccination, there is often a more mild and atypical presentation described as “breakthrough disease.”
Breakthrough disease occurs in approximately 1 of 5 vaccinated children. It is usually mild and sometimes atypical; thus, it may often get missed by clinicians. It often has <50 lesions and may not cause a fever. Lesions may never become vesicular in nature. 
Complications
Pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, children <1 y old, and older adults are most at risk of severe disease and complications. 
Skin and soft tissue infection with Staph. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common complication in adults and is associated with dehydration. 
Pneumonitis is rare in children but increases in frequency in adolescents and adults.
It is considered the most serious of all complications, because it results in respiratory failure.
Typically starts a few days to a week after the characteristic rash appears.
Risk factors include immunocompromised, third trimester pregnancy, smoking, chronic lung disease, and severity of the skin rash.
IV acyclovir and intensive care has improved the outcomes, with a mortality of roughly 10%. 
Cerebellar ataxia
If this is present, it may be accompanied by a headache, lethargy, nuchal rigidity, nystagmus, and vomiting.
The CSF is often normal.
The majority of patients recover within 1-3 wk without any apparent sequelae.
Encephalitis
The most serious neurologic complication is exceedingly rare.
Headache, vomiting, altered mental status, and seizures may be part of the clinical picture.
The CSF is usually abnormal.
Laboratory Evaluation
PCR of the DNA from the vesicular fluid or cells is the most sensitive way to detect VZV infection, but it is expensive and not always available. Culture and DFA are available, but less sensitive and less specific than PCR. 
Testing for possible VZV infection may be important for infection control or in patients at a high risk of complications, such as neonates, elderly, pregnant, and immunocompromised patients.
Therapeutic Considerations
Acyclovir should be administered as early as possible, since it is more effective during the first 24 h of the rash.
Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q8h should be administered to anyone with severe disease (eg, pneumonia, encephalitis, thrombocytopenia, severe hepatitis) or at a high risk of disease complications (eg, cancer, HIV, or other immunocompromised states, including high-dose steroids for >14 d).
Oral acyclovir 800 mg PO q6h for 5 d should be administered to healthy adults and pregnant women with uncomplicated varicella; it has been shown to reduce the number of days of fever and the number of new lesions, but its therapeutic effect is unclear. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends only giving oral acyclovir to healthy children with risk factors for more severe illness or complications, including >12 y old, chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, receiving long-term salicylate therapy, or receiving short, intermittent, or aerosolized courses of corticosteroids. Healthy children <12 y old do not typically require treatment.
Valacyclovir 20 mg/kg (max 1 g) PO q8h for 5 d is an alternative to acyclovir that requires less frequent dosing, but it has not been approved for use in children <2 y old.
In hospitalized patients, airborne and contact precautions should be used until all the lesions are dry/crusted over. Patients should also not return to work or school until all lesions are dry/crusted over. Patients with varicella should only be cared for by staff with evidence of immunity.  (CDC- Chicken Pox)
Varicella−Zoster (Shingles)
Photo Photo
Epidemiology
Almost 1 out of 3 individuals will experience shingles during their lifetime.
99.5% of adults >40 y old have been infected with wild-type varicella, and therefore are at risk of developing zoster.
Zoster results in 96 deaths each year, almost always in elderly and immunocompromised patients.  Age is the most important risk factor, since the immune system weakens with age, allowing for viral reactivation. Most cases occur in patients >60 y old, and by 85 y old, half of patients have had an episode of zoster.
Immunocompromised patients (eg, transplant recipients, chemotherapy, HIV, patients on immunomodulators or steroids) are also at a higher risk of developing zoster, because a decrease in T-cell immunity allows for reactivation of the latent virus.
VZV can be transmitted to others (direct contact or airborne) until the lesions are dry/crusted over, causing varicella in someone who is naïve and unvaccinated. 
Zoster has been increasing over the last 75 years, with a 4-fold increase affecting the elderly and women disproportionately. 
The zoster (shingles) vaccine has been in use since 2006. The preferred vaccine, Shingrix, has been in use since 2017 and is more than 90% effective at preventing zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).
Vaccinated children have a 79% lower incidence of zoster than those who are unvaccinated. They are also less likely to be infected with the wild-type varicella virus, which is more aggressive and causes greater PHN. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Zoster (shingles) is a secondary infection; reactivation of the endogenous latent infection in the sensory ganglia leads to the classic dermatomal distribution.
Complications
Post-herpetic Neuralgia
PHN is described as severe pain in the area where the rash occurred for more than 30-90 d. It occurs in roughly 10%-15% of patients with zoster and increases in frequency with age. Patients may develop numbness, dysesthesia, pruritus, and allodynia.
Treatment with gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants may reduce the severity of the symptoms. 
Zoster Ophthalmicus
Involves infection in the ophthalmic division of the 5th cranial nerve.
Usually begins with a headache, fever, malaise, and pain around the affected eye, forehead, and top of the head.
The patient may also develop conjunctivitis, uveitis, keratitis, scleritis, and optic neuritis. 
Vesicular lesions on the side or the tip of the nose (Hutchinson’s sign Photo) correlate highly with eye involvement,  indicating involvement of the nasociliary branch of the trigeminal nerve.
Early treatment with antiviral medicines can reduce the number of patients with eye disorders from 50% to 25%. 
Oral antivirals should be initiated at the first sign of zoster ophthalmicus, regardless of the timing or stage of disease. 
Any eye involvement should prompt Ophthalmology consultation, and steroid drops may be added to the antiviral regimen.
Immunocompromised patients should be admitted for IV antivirals.
Zoster Oticus (Ramsay Hunt Syndrome)
Figure
Triad of ipsilateral vesicles on the auricle or inner ear canal, facial paralysis, and ear pain.
Some patients may have taste and hearing alterations, lacrimation, or vertigo. 
Treatment consists of valacyclovir 1 g PO q8h for 7-10 d and prednisone 1 mg/kg PO q24h for 5 d. 
Severe disease (vertigo, tinnitus, or hearing loss) should prompt admission, IV antivirals, and consultation with an otolaryngologist.
CNS Involvement
Aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, peripheral motor neuropathy, myelitis and Guillain-Barré Syndrome have all been described in association with zoster infection.
Laboratory Evaluation
Diagnosis can often be made clinically in a healthy patient with a classic rash.
If the diagnosis is unclear, PCR of DNA from any lesion, blood, conjunctiva, or CSF is preferred; the sensitivity is ~95% and the test can usually be performed in <1 d. 
DFA or viral culture from an unroofed vesicle can be performed but has been shown to be only 55% sensitive. DFA should yield results within 2 h, while culture can take up to 1 wk.
Therapeutic Considerations
Antiviral therapy shortens the course of the lesions, lessens pain, and may decrease the frequency of PHN. The role of antivirals depends on the duration of the symptoms. 
Therapy should be initiated in all patients presenting <72 h from the onset of symptoms.
If it has been >72 h since symptom onset, only initiate antiviral therapy if new lesions continue to develop, which suggests continued propagation of the virus.
Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir have been shown to be equally effective.
Acyclovir 800 mg PO 5 times/d for 7 d is the least expensive but requires frequent dosing.
1 wk of valacyclovir 1,000 mg PO q8h or famciclovir 500 mg PO q8h are other options that require less frequent dosing but are more expensive.
PO steroids may be helpful with pain in an acute outbreak; however, they could increase the risk of bacterial infection and have not been shown to affect the rate of PHN. 
Immunocompetent patients with disseminated zoster or serious complications should receive IV acyclovir and be admitted to the hospital.
Immunocompromised patients should be started on antiviral medication regardless of the duration of symptoms. Patients with widespread disease or systemic symptoms should be admitted to the hospital for IV antivirals.",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)
Epidemiology
Primary infection occurs via inoculation at a mucosal surface or an open skin site and may be accompanied by fever and malaise.
Almost 80% of primary infections are asymptomatic or without classic skin lesions. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The classic description of HSV is a cluster of vesicular lesions on an erythematous base; it most commonly affects the lips or genitalia.
In children, it often presents as gingivostomatitis; lesions on the lips, tongue, and mucosa. These lesions are predominantly at the front of the mouth and on the skin along the vermilion border. It may be associated with pharyngitis. The rash can be differentiated from herpangina by the anterior location of most lesions. 
In adults, it is often characterized by oral lesions and pharyngitis.
HSV-1 will usually recur on the lips and the skin, whereas HSV-2 will usually recur on the genitalia. Photo Photo
Complications
Neonatal HSV
The classic vesicular rash may cluster on an erythematous base anywhere on the skin (eg, skin, eyes, mouth), and sometimes in areas of localized trauma such as on the scalp.
Typically presents in the first 2 wk of life but can occur up to 6 wk old.
Only roughly 45%-60% of patients with neonatal HSV will have skin lesions; if untreated, there is a high risk of progression to CNS or disseminated disease. Half of those with CNS or disseminated disease have skin findings. 
If there is clinical suspicion of disease in a neonate
Obtain surface swabs from the conjunctiva, mouth, nasopharynx, and rectum for viral culture, since this is the best way to detect the HSV and is positive in >90% of cases.
PCR of DNA from skin lesions may be useful but has not been studied in neonates, and should therefore always be supplemented by viral cultures.
CSF studies, including PCR for HSV, have a sensitivity of 75%-100% and a specificity of 71%-100%. 
Additional laboratory testing to obtain: serum PCR for HSV, CBC, metabolic panel, and bacterial cultures.
Confirmed HSV disease of any degree warrants an ophthalmologic exam and neuroimaging, but this can be performed as an inpatient.
Any ill-appearing, febrile infant up to 6 wk old should prompt concern for possible HSV disease, even without skin lesions. A high index of suspicion, antiviral tests, and treatment with acyclovir can improve morbidity. 
Ocular HSV
Photo
Keratitis: Acute onset of pain, blurry vision, and watery discharge. Patients may have decreased corneal sensation, chemosis, conjunctivitis, and dendritic lesions on the cornea.
Consult Ophthalmology and prescribe oral and topical antivirals. Avoid steroid drops.
Disseminated HSV
Immunocompromised hosts lack the cellular immunity to contain the virus and are at a higher risk of complications and dissemination. Patients at a higher risk include those with HIV or cancer, transplant recipients, neonates, the elderly, and pregnant women.
Complications can include encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and esophagitis.
These patients require admission to the hospital and IV antivirals.
HSV can infect the skin in particular patterns:
Herpetic whitlow: Finger infection in children from 6 mo to 6 y old that arises from auto-inoculation. Dentists and healthcare workers are more at risk as adults. It may be misdiagnosed as a bacterial infection. Usually self-limiting and resolves within 3-4 wk.  Treatment is with oral antiviral medication.
Eczema herpeticum: Occurs in patients with atopic dermatitis who have a HSV outbreak in areas of affected skin. There are often multiple lesions, which can be vesicular, pustular, or punched out. Similar to whitlow, it can be difficult to differentiate from a bacterial infection.
Dermatologic consult should be obtained if the diagnosis is unclear.
Viral tests of the lesions and bacterial culture should be obtained due to the difficulty in differentiating viral vs. bacterial processes.
Admission with both antiviral and empiric antibiotic coverage is typically required, unless the involvement of the skin is limited and the patient has outpatient follow-up with a dermatologist. Photo Photo
Eczema gladiatorum: HSV-1 is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, often in wrestling, football, rugby, or other contact sports. It appears as clustered vesicular lesions, often on the head, face, or chest. Treatment is with oral antivirals. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Antiviral agents are the primary treatment for HSV.
Acyclovir has a modest effect in the treatment of herpes labialis, reducing the duration of pain by approximately one-third and healing time by one-fourth if initiated early (<48 h from onset). Dosing is 400 mg PO 5 times/d for 5 d. 
The first episode of genital HSV is treated with acyclovir 200 mg PO 5 times/d or 400 mg PO q8h for 7-10 d. Episodic treatment of recurrent genital herpes is acyclovir 200 mg PO 5 times/d or 800 mg PO q12h for 5 d.
Neonatal HSV requires acyclovir at 20 mg/kg IV q8h, as per the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Bullous Impetigo
Photo Photo
Epidemiology
Most often seen in young children <5 y old, particularly infants.
Pathophysiology
A form of skin infection with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus that produces an exfoliative skin toxin.
The toxin targets the same protein as bullous pemphigoid, leading to separation of the epidermis and dermis.
It rarely progress to SSSS, but can if the toxin reaches the bloodstream.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
May start as a small vesicle that enlarges to form a flaccid bulla containing a clear yellow fluid.
It is often itchy and not painful.
The blister ruptures leaving a yellow-brown crust.
It is most prevalent on the neck, axillae, inguinal folds, and around the mouth.
Mucosal surfaces are spared.
Often, the crusty ulceration is present at the time of evaluation with only a history of a blister.
Laboratory Evaluation
Lesions can be cultured to confirm the diagnosis.
Therapeutic Considerations
A limited disease that should be treated with topical mupirocin 3 times/d. Extensive lesions should also be treated with an oral antibiotic that covers Staph. and Strep. species, such as cephalexin. ",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Bullous Pemphigoid
Photo
Epidemiology
A rare disease found in 1 in 5.5 million individuals.
Typically afflicts adults >60 y old.
There is an association with dementia, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson’s disease.
Pathophysiology
A chronic autoimmune disease of the skin that is hypothesized to arise from autoantibodies against proteins in the basement membrane of epithelial cells. Loss of cell adhesion causes the dermis to separate from the epidermis.
It is hypothesized that certain medications or infections may contain antibodies that cross-react with these areas of the epithelial basement membrane.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Patients may have a prodrome of diffuse pruritic plaques or urticaria.
Later in the disease, most patients develop bullae that are 1-3 cm and tense. These are most prominent in the flexural areas of the skin (axillary, inguinal).
Less than one-third of patients develop blisters on their mucous membranes. This rash can resemble Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Other patients may only have a localized rash. 
The rash is relapsing and remitting over the patient’s lifetime.
Laboratory Evaluation
Patients should be referred to a dermatologist for a skin biopsy.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can identify antibodies in the serum associated with bullous pemphigoid (BP230 and BP180) and should be obtained in consultation with a dermatologist.
Therapeutic Considerations
If the diagnosis is uncertain, consult a dermatologist, particularly if there is mucous membrane involvement.
High-potency topical steroids are the mainstay of therapy and are superior to systemic steroids; however, if this is not optimal, systemic steroids are often used, particularly in widespread disease. 
Dermatologists may prescribe immunosuppressants for an outpatient.
Admit patients with signs/symptoms of systemic illness. This is a potentially fatal disease, usually due to complicating infection.",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Pemphigus Vulgaris
Epidemiology
Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare disease, occurring in approximately 1 in 1 million individuals. It is more common in Ashkenazi Jews and those of Middle Eastern and Indian descent.
It is much more common in adults, typically arising after 40 y old.
Pathophysiology
Autoantibodies to intracellular adhesion molecules in the skin lead to acantholysis.
Medications, such as captopril, may produce a drug-induced acantholysis. A thorough review of the patient’s medications is necessary.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
PhotoPhoto Photo Photo Photo Photo
Blisters arise on mucous membranes, particularly the oral mucosa, and tend to be painful and rupture readily, leaving erosions of the mucosal surface.
Patients also often have bullae on non-mucosal surfaces. These bullae are flaccid, unlike the tense bullae of bullous pemphigoid. Nikolsky’s sign is common.
Pain can be severe, leading to poor oral intake. Blisters are not pruritic.
Complications include dehydration and bacterial infections. Without treatment, the disease is often fatal within several years of onset.
Laboratory Evaluation
In consultation with a dermatologist, patients should undergo a skin biopsy. ELISA demonstrates autoantibodies to desmoglein in the patient’s blood.
Therapeutic Considerations
Systemic steroids (eg, prednisone 1-1.5 mg/kg/d PO) are effective in inducing remission of the disease and should be prescribed from the ED, ideally in consultation with a dermatologist. A small study found no benefit to higher doses of prednisone. Weeks of steroid therapy are often necessary to achieve remission. 
Patients may require pain control with topical anesthetics or systemic medications.
Erosions on the skin should be kept clean and covered with antibiotic ointment to minimize the risk of bacterial infection.
Dermatologists may often also administer immunosuppressant agents, such as rituximab or azathioprine, but these are rarely necessary in the ED.
Admit if the patient is systemically ill, since there are high rates of associated morbidity and mortality. ",Blistering Rashes
"Deep Dive - Allergic Contact Dermatitis/Poison Ivy
Photo
Epidemiology
Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are the most common offenders, which may leave a linear or streaking pattern, classic of exposure.
Other potential allergens include latex materials, nickel, cobalt, perfumes, and cleansers.
Contact dermatitis is more common in individuals who regularly encounter these substances, including healthcare workers, beauticians, and construction workers.
The incidence increases with age.
Pathophysiology
Topical allergens trigger a type IV hypersensitivity response in patients who have previously been sensitized to the allergen.
Following initial exposure to the allergen, T lymphocytes directed against the allergen are produced. After encountering the allergen at a later time point, the body produces an inflammatory reaction over the next 48-72 h.
Often, multiple exposures to the allergen are required to produce sensitization.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Most commonly, patients develop pruritic, erythematous, indurated, and clearly demarcated plaques.
Vesicles or bullae may develop; when they rupture, they may leave a crust.
Patients may report a burning discomfort in the distribution of the rash.
The rash is localized to the area of skin exposed to the irritant; however, patients may transfer the irritant to distant areas.
The distribution of the rash may provide clues as to the identity of the allergen. For example, the involvement of the scalp is most common following a reaction to hair products.
Symptoms usually develop within a few hours, but may arise up to 4 d following exposure.
Chronic dermatitis may lead to lichenification.
Patients should be questioned about possible exposures. Patients may have multiple prior exposures to an allergen without incident and subsequently develop a reaction.
Laboratory Evaluation
In the ED, the diagnosis is made clinically. The inciting allergen may not be readily apparent.
Laboratory testing is rarely helpful in the acute setting.
Outpatient patch testing may help to determine the etiology. Complete resolution of symptoms without any recurrence obviates the need for patch testing.
Therapeutic Considerations
Topical high-potency steroids are recommended, such as clobetasol propionate 0.05% BID.  Lower-potency steroids should be utilized on the face, genitals, and intertriginous areas due to the risk of atrophy.
Extensive disease (>20% body surface area) or disease involving the face or genitalia may require systemic steroids and longer courses of treatment; prednisone or prednisolone 1 mg/kg PO q24h (max 60 mg) × 5 d with a tapering dose during the second week. 
Topical tacrolimus may aid in refractory cases.
Administer symptomatic, adjunctive therapies such as cool compresses, oatmeal baths, and calamine lotion.
Sedating antihistamines are often prescribed and may help with sleep.",Blistering Rashes
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
The extent of a chemical burn may be rapidly evident or insidious (ie, symptoms occurring hours later) and thus should not be underestimated.
All patients should be on continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
Obtaining intravenous access is prudent given the possible need for both crystalloid resuscitation and electrolyte repletion, which are required after significant hydrofluoric acid (HF) exposure.
Any signs of airway injury or distress:
visible burns
phonation problems
neck pain/edema
Stridor
Wheezing
should prompt early intubation; delay may lead to inability to obtain airway, resultant hypoxia, and death.
Thorough decontamination is critical to ensure no ongoing exposure and injury.
First, remove all clothing exposed to the chemical agent.
Second, brush off any powders on the skin.
Third, perform soap and water irrigation, which is sufficient decontamination for most substances.
Ocular irrigation (ie, Morgan lens) is important for ocular exposures.
Ensure that adequate analgesia is provided.
Treatment at a burn center is recommended for any significant injury; criteria for chemical burns are the same as those used for thermal burns.
Discuss exposure and specific chemical burn management in conjunction with the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 (U.S.) or a toxicologist.
Key Concepts
Chemical burns have the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality.
Acids cause coagulative necrosis, whereas alkalis cause liquefactive necrosis, which tends to produce deeper, more significant injuries.
While the pH of the chemical is important, it is not the sole predictor of the extent of injury.
Burns can occur via direct contact, inhalation, or ingestion.
Patient decontamination and stabilization should NOT be delayed for chemical agent identification; early skin decontamination is essential for dermatologic exposures.
Powdered chemicals should be brushed off prior to any water-based decontamination.
Continuous low-pressure warm water irrigation is the ideal method for most exposures.
Patients should be assessed for concomitant injuries (eg, chemical burns to the face should also be assessed for pulmonary or gastrointestinal involvement).
Certain chemicals have unique toxicities that will alter management, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) causing electrolyte imbalances and cardiac dysrhythmias.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: Patient presents to the ED after an unknown liquid was accidentally spilled on her at work. She reports pain and skin blistering.
Always assess the oropharynx for obvious signs of burns.
Acids (61%-72% of burns) and alkalis (32%) are responsible for the majority of chemical injuries, although the percentages vary greatly between studies. 
Partial-thickness burns are the most common depth of injury (45%-56%). 
The burn size is less than 10% total body surface area in two-thirds of patients. 
Cellulitis or wound infection is rare, complicating only 3.7% of chemical injuries. 
Treatment
Powdered substances should be brushed off prior to water decontamination. The skin should then be copiously irrigated with soap and water for about 30 min.
Early intubation is necessary for oropharyngeal or extensive facial involvement given the high likelihood of decompensation and difficulty with obtaining the airway late. Analgesia should be provided; however, there is no evidence-based preferred agent. Acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ketamine, and opioids are all acceptable options, and medication should be based on the extent of injury, the patient’s degree of discomfort, and the clinician’s judgment. 
A burn care specialist should be consulted for any high-risk areas (eg, genitals, joints) or any significant exposure (ie, signs of skin penetration, such as erosions, blisters, ulcers, or necrosis).
Disposition
Home
Patients with small body surface area involvement, superficial burns, and no other complicating features can be discharged home.
Admission
Patients requiring aggressive pain control and/or debridement should be admitted to a monitored unit.
Patients with a large total body surface area burn, airway involvement requiring intubation, or hemodynamic instability should be admitted to an ICU.
Patients with HF ingestion or industrial-strength dermal exposures should be admitted to an ICU.
Transfer to a burn center is based on consensus recommendations; thermal burn criteria are applied to chemical burns.
Thermal burn referral criteria (ameriburn.org):
Full-thickness burns
Partial-thickness burns of 10% or greater of the total body surface area
Burns involving the hands, face, feet, genitalia, major joints, or perineum
Electrical, lightning, chemical, or inhalation injuries
Concomitant traumatic injury in which the burn poses greater morbidity and mortality risk
Patients with comorbidities, leading to immunosuppression or delayed healing, which could complicate recovery.
Patients with social or emotional constraints
Children",Chemical Burns
"Deep Dive
Background
A chemical burn occurs when a corrosive substance (ie, cytotoxic agent, strong acid, or strong base) is exposed to tissue.
Epidemiology
Over 25,000 chemicals used in industrial, agricultural, household, or occupational settings have the potential to cause cutaneous injury. 
Although chemical burns account for only ~3% of all burns, they are associated with higher morbidity and mortality, accounting for nearly one-third of all burn deaths. 
Chemicals and household cleaning substances accounted for 234,007 human exposures as reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers in 2017, which represented 9% of all exposures. 
Household cleaning substances were the second leading cause of exposures in children less than 5 y of age. 
Occupational exposure is the most common means of exposure, representing approximately two-thirds of chemical burns in industrial areas. 
Pathophysiology
Thermal burns typically result from short-term exposure (on the order of seconds) to intense heat. In contrast, chemical burns are often due to a longer exposure time (minutes), and the offending agent may still be present, causing ongoing injury at the time of presentation. 
All types of burns (chemical, thermal, electrical, radiation) lead to protein denaturation. 
Chemical burns also have other methods of protein destruction, such as hydrolysis, which disrupts the stabilizing forces necessary to maintain the three-dimensional structure of proteins. 
The severity of a chemical injury is dependent on a number of factors: concentration, quantity, duration of contact, degree of penetration, and the mechanism of action of the chemical. 
Six mechanisms of action for chemical agent injury in biological systems have been described. A chemical may cause damage through multiple mechanisms:
Oxidation, wherein a protein is denatured due to the insertion of an oxygen, sulfur, or halogen atom. Examples include chromic acid, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), and potassium permanganate.
Reduction, where the agent binds free electrons of proteins in tissues. Heat may also be released, which can result in thermal burns in addition to chemical injury. Examples include hydrochloric acid and nitric acid.
Corrosion, where the agent causes protein denaturation on contact and tends to produce an eschar that may lead to ulceration. Examples include phenol, sodium hypochlorite, and white phosphorus.
Protoplasmic poisons, where the agent forms an ester with proteins (eg, formic acid, acetic acid) or otherwise inhibits ions necessary for cellular function (eg, oxalic acid, HF).
Vesicants, which produce ischemia by causing an anoxic necrosis at the point of contact. Examples include mustard gas, dimethylsulfoxide, and Lewisite (the agent that was the original target for the chelator BAL, or British Anti-Lewisite, used as an antidote in lead and other metal poisonings).
Desiccants, which dry out the tissues, resulting in cellular dehydration. These reactions are usually exothermic, and also cause damage due to the heat produced. Examples include sulfuric acid and muriatic acid (a concentrated form of hydrochloric acid).
An alternate classification system is based on the chemical reactions that are caused by the agent, rather than the means by which proteins are degraded. 
Acids donate protons and release hydrogen ions, causing the pH to decrease from a physiologic range of around 7 to as low as 0. Acids cause a coagulative necrosis. The coagulum, or eschar, often limits the degree of penetration of the chemical.
The pH of the acid, while important, is not the best measure to estimate the strength of the chemical. For example, the pH of cola-flavored soda is 2.52 and does not cause cutaneous or mucosal injury, yet soldering flux with a near-neutral pH of 6.8 can cause significant damage. 
Titratable acid/alkaline reserve (TAR) has been proposed to be a better indicator of potential injury than pH alone. TAR is the amount of alkaline (or acid) required to bring the pH back to a physiologic range for an acidic (or alkaline, respectively) chemical. 
Bases accept protons and will remove hydrogen ions and cause the pH to increase. Alkalis cause liquefactive necrosis, which results in adipose saponification. This results in deeper tissue penetration of the chemical, which is why alkali burns are usually more severe than acid burns.
Organic solutions dissolve lipid membranes as well as cause protein disruption.
Inorganic solutions inflict injury by directly binding to the tissues and inducing the formation of salts.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Unlike thermal burns, the appearance of a chemical burn is often misleading. Chemical burns may appear superficial but still cause significant depth of damage.
Patients often present with a chemical burn and will not know the inciting agent.
With a few exceptions, the approach to management is frequently the same. Inability to identify the specific agent does not impact initial stabilization and management.
If working with chemicals in occupational settings, the patient may have knowledge of the chemical and access to a safety data sheet (SDS, also formerly known as material safety data sheet or MSDS) that has information on the agent.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that SDSs are readily available and in a standard format. 
SDSs should not be considered a gold standard. One study in Europe found that nearly half of sheets had shortcomings. A common shortcoming was not listing substances that were in concentrations of <1%, even though they had the potential to cause effects. Approximately 18% of sheets were missing information or had incorrect information. 
For pediatric exposures, asking the parent or caregiver to write down or take a picture of the exact product name can aid in identification via an internet search or consultation with a poison control center.
The clinician should seek clarification from the patient on whether the formulation was a “household” product or an “industrial” product. For example, household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) usually has a concentration of around 5% and rarely causes significant injury. However, industrial forms may be 3 to 5 times more concentrated and have greater potential to cause damage.
Adult chemical exposures, particularly ingestions, may stem from an attempt at self-harm.
In the pediatric population, non-accidental trauma should be considered in the differential. One burn center noted that 5.3% of pediatric burn admissions were due to abuse. Abuse was a significant predictor of mortality with an odds ratio of 3.3. Scald injury was the most common; however, chemical burns are also a potential predictor of abuse. Clinicians should maintain an index of suspicion and consider further non-accidental trauma workup for suspicious cases.

For most chemicals, there are no readily available labs or diagnostics that indicate the agent of exposure.
Radiographs should be obtained if there is concern for:
Foreign bodies at the site of injury
Ingestion and potential perforation
Household bleach rarely causes significant gastrointestinal injury, and exposed patients do not require radiographic evaluation.
Respiratory distress
Burns to a large total body surface area have the potential to cause significant multisystem organ effects due to the loss of skin as a protective barrier. About 55% of chemical burn injuries require a surgical procedure such as debridement, skin graft/flap, and/or amputation.  It is reasonable to obtain a CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, and type and screen on any patient with a significant chemical exposure.
Therapeutic Considerations
Dermal decontamination is the first-line treatment for chemical burns. Chemicals may continue to be absorbed and cause damage; therefore, limiting ongoing exposure is the first priority in treatment.
Powders should be brushed off prior to soap and water decontamination, as water may promote absorption into the skin.
It is crucial to ensure that dry lime is completely brushed off before water irrigation, as dry lime reacts with water to form a more harmful alkali.
Dilution, not neutralization, is the goal in decontamination. Do not attempt to neutralize an acid with a base (or vice versa), as this may produce an exothermic reaction. Additionally, the inciting chemical is often not known initially. Neutralizing agents or antidotes are the exception, not the rule, and should not delay decontamination.
Patients who undergo continuous irrigation, such as under a running faucet, have more effective decontamination and shorter lengths of hospitalization than those who are decontaminated with saline-soaked gauze.
Apply water with low pressure to avoid splashes and spreading of the chemical.
Irrigation should continue until the pH of the skin is neutral, when measured 15 min after irrigation is stopped. Alkali burns may require prolonged periods of irrigation lasting for hours.
If possible, decontamination should happen in the field prior to transfer to the ED.
Notable exceptions to decontamination with water are:
Phenol: low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol (PEG-400), which is different from the high-molecular-weight PEG used for bowel preparations, may be superior to water-based decontamination. However, PEG-400 is often difficult to obtain in the ED, and the evidence of its benefit is not definitive. Therefore, standard water decontamination is also acceptable. 
White or yellow phosphorus (which are essentially the same, with yellow phosphorus having a small amount of contamination with red phosphorus): Phosphorus glows when exposed to air, leading to its name (“light-bearer”). White phosphorus is highly reactive and can ignite spontaneously at 93°F (34°C). It may emit a garlicky odor. Due to the combustion risk, affected areas should be submerged in water or covered with materials such as gauze soaked in water or saline to prevent ongoing reactions with atmospheric oxygen. Fragments of phosphorus removed from wounds should be placed under water to minimize the fire risk. A Wood’s lamp can be used to look for residual fragments, which give off a yellow fluorescence.
Of note, red phosphorus is less toxic than white or yellow and does not ignite in air. Red phosphorus is often used in the illicit manufacturing of methamphetamine.
Historically, solutions of 2%-5% copper sulfate were applied to decontaminate and allow for better visualization of phosphorus particles. However, these high concentrations can cause copper toxicity, such as hemolysis. A dilute copper sulfate solution (0.5%-1%) can be considered as a one-time application as it may allow for better visualization of phosphorus by causing darkening of the particles. It is recommended that the skin be rinsed with water after application. 
Elemental metals such as potassium, lithium, magnesium, and cesium may release heat or explode when irrigated with water. After these substances are removed, the skin should be covered with mineral oil to prevent exposure to moisture in the ambient environment.
Diphoterine (Laboratoire Prevor, Valmondois, France) is an amphoteric chelating solution developed as an eyewash for chemical exposures, though it has also been used in dermal exposures. It may be more effective than water irrigation in returning the pH to a normal range and has shown improved outcomes and healing times. Diphoterine uses a canister to deliver the compound and thereby requires both drug and device approval by the Food and Drug Administration, which has not been granted in the U.S. 
Early surgical debridement for decontamination does not improve length of stay or hasten recovery compared with standard irrigation. There may still be a role for debridement (eg, large painful bullae or those located in regions that will undergo significant strain such as a joint or crease), but not solely for the purpose of decontamination. 
Treatment after decontamination is mainly supportive. Exposures with specific treatments (eg, HF or non-skin routes of exposure) are listed below.
Consultations with a burn specialist and a medical toxicologist are recommended for any concentrated product or any depth other than a superficial burn.
Although cellulitis is the leading complication in chemical skin injury patients, only 3% of patients develop cellulitis. 
There is no strong evidence evaluating the role of prophylactic antibiotics. Clinicians should take into account the patient’s comorbidities when determining the need for prophylactic antibiotics; empiric antibiotic therapy is not necessary for all patients.
Since the majority of chemical burns in adults are occupational and in pediatrics are accidental household exposures, prevention measures should be encouraged to mitigate future risks of harm.
Workplaces should follow the Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines.
Families should keep chemicals out of reach and safeguarded against exploratory exposures by children.
Ocular Injury
Epidemiology
Chemical burns account for 12%-22% of eye injuries. 
Children <2 y of age have the highest risk of chemical injuries to the eye. 
Pathophysiology
Chemical burns have the potential to cause a spectrum of ocular injuries, ranging from superficial corneal epithelial damage to complete corneal opacification and limbal ischemia. There is also the potential for increased intraocular pressure that may develop within 1 wk of the injury. 
Similarly to dermal burns, alkalis are prone to causing more severe injuries.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Patients often report pain, photophobia, and vision loss.
Physical examination reveals conjunctival injection and blepharospasm. Foreign bodies may also be present.
Therapeutic Considerations
Copious irrigation as soon as possible after ocular exposure is universally recommended.
There is no true consensus on the time or volume of irrigation; however, reasonable recommendations include 15-30 min of irrigation with 1-3 L of fluid. Irrigation should be continued until a normal pH is achieved. 
Clean tap water is an effective fluid for immediate irrigation. It reduces the severity of the burn and improves healing time; however, low osmolarity compared with physiologic fluids may lead to corneal edema. 
Isotonic saline solution has been shown to be less efficacious than tap water as an
irrigation solution. 
In a study on various irrigation solutions, balanced saline solution plus (BSS Plus, Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA) was preferred followed by lactated Ringer’s or normal saline with sodium bicarbonate, and finally normal saline was the least preferred. 
An irrigating contact lens, such as the Morgan lens (MorTan, Inc., Missoula, MT, USA), can be used to deliver the irrigation solution. Photo
Use of the Morgan lens can be difficult in the pediatric population. A proposed alternative to irrigation in the younger population includes connecting the irrigation solution to a nasal cannula and placing the prongs at the nasal aspect of the eyes to allow for continuous irrigation. Photo
Apply anesthetic drops to the eye before irrigation.
It is recommended to irrigate until the eye reaches a neutral pH. However, the use of litmus pH paper is an imperfect test. For example, measurements too quickly (<15 min) after irrigation can result in falsely neutral measurements. Dried-out paper or that which is not appropriately quality-controlled may also result in errors. 
Strong alkali agents, such as lye and ammonia, may produce severe burns with persistent alterations in the pH of the deeper structures of the eye despite normal pH of the ocular secretions. Therefore, patients exposed to these agents often require prolonged irrigation for 1-2 h regardless of the pH.
Consultation with an ophthalmologist is recommended for any patient who remains symptomatic after irrigation or with exposures to strong alkalis.
Therapies that may have a benefit include topical and oral ascorbate, topical steroids, topical citrate, and prophylactic topical antibiotics in the setting of an epithelial defect. 
One proposed steroid regimen includes either topical prednisolone 1% or topical dexamethasone 0.1% every 2 h, in conjunction with vitamin C (ascorbate), with tapering of the steroid over 10-14 d. The use of topical steroids for more than 6 d has been associated with corneoscleral degradation. 
Many other agents have been proposed for treatment but do not have sufficient evidence in humans to routinely support their use. Such therapies include fibronectin, epidermal growth factor, retinoic acid, hyaluronic acid, tetracyclines, n-acetylcysteine, and NSAIDs. 
Preservative-free tear substitutes (artificial tears) are routinely recommended to promote healing and epithelialization. 
Asymptomatic patients with neutral pH can be discharged from the ED with Ophthalmology follow-up in a few days.
Gastrointestinal Exposure
Epidemiology
Patients with significant dermal exposures to the neck or face or those reporting ingestion or inhalation of a chemical should be evaluated for airway and gastrointestinal (GI) involvement.
Pathophysiology
Concentrated products, such as laundry pods, industrial chemicals, and certain household products may cause injury with relatively small exposures.
Crystal or solid products are more likely to cause mucosal injury to the oral cavity and pharynx, while liquids more often cause esophageal injury as they are more easily swallowed. 
Strictures may form after 3 wk.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Acids tend to cause black mucosal sloughing in the oropharynx, and alkalis tend to cause grey opaque or semi-opaque membrane formation. 
Oral burns are generally not considered a reliable indicator of esophageal injury. Severe oropharyngeal injury can suggest digestive necrosis. Significant esophageal injuries may present without any visible signs of injury in the oropharynx. Similarly, those with oropharyngeal burns may not have esophageal or airway injury. 
Voice changes, inability to manage secretions (drooling), stridor, or nasal flaring suggest laryngeal or epiglottic injury, and early intubation should be considered in such cases.
Rebound tenderness suggests perforation and should prompt surgical consultation.
Perforation may be delayed up to 1 wk after exposure to the chemical.
A small subset of asymptomatic patients will have significant burns to their gastrointestinal tract.
Laboratory/Radiographic Evaluation
Laboratory studies are not routinely necessary.
Early flexible endoscopy (3-48 h post-ingestion) remains the gold standard of diagnostic assessment. 
For pediatric corrosive ingestions, the use of endoscopy should be dictated by
symptoms, as it may not be required for asymptomatic patients (no drooling, mouth lesions, abdominal pain, vomiting, dysphagia) who ingested chemicals with low causticity. 
Ingestions of high causticity chemicals should prompt endoscopy, even in asymptomatic patients.
Chest radiography should be obtained on any patient with respiratory symptoms or signs of upper airway injury.
CT has been studied in caustic ingestions and may have a role in adults in determining the need for surgeries, such as exploratory laparotomy or esophagectomy. CT should be considered in adults with evidence of oral burns or any symptoms (eg, odynophagia, abdominal pain, vomiting) and may have a role in asymptomatic patients; however, endoscopy remains the gold standard.
Nasogastric tube placement can lead to perforation and should not be done.
Therapeutic Considerations
Intravenous corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine have been successfully used to reduce laryngeal edema. 
Routine use of steroids for GI exposure to caustic materials is not recommended as meta-analyses do not support reports of efficacy. Intravenous dexamethasone may be warranted to prevent esophageal stricture formation from more significant injuries seen on endoscopy in Grade IIb lesions only. 
As with dermal burns, attempts to neutralize acids by administering bases (and vice versa) should be avoided.
Encouraging consumption of vast amounts of milk or water may induce vomiting and should also be avoided.
Activated charcoal is not helpful. It will not absorb most ingested chemicals, and it makes endoscopy more difficult.
Antibiotics are indicated only if there is concern for perforation or concomitant respiratory infection.
Patients with clinical or radiographic signs of perforation require surgery. Endoscopy should not be used in these patients, as it delays definitive surgical treatment.
Consult with poison control to determine the causticity of the ingested chemical.
Asymptomatic adults with normal physical examinations and accidental ingestions of small amounts of low causticity chemicals can often be discharged after several hours of observation and a trial of oral intake.
Asymptomatic children with normal physical examinations and accidental ingestions of small amounts of low causticity chemicals can be discharged after several hours of observation in the ED, as long as they are able to take appropriate oral intake.
Patients with symptoms, suicidal ingestions, and those with abnormal CTs or radiographs often benefit from endoscopy and hospital admission.
Inhalation Exposure
Epidemiology
Inhaled toxic substances such as gases and vapors can cause pulmonary injury.
Dermal exposures to various irritants or caustics can also be complicated by concurrent inhalational toxicity.
Pathophysiology
Highly water-soluble and irritating gases (eg, ammonia, formaldehyde, sodium azide) are more likely to cause damage to the upper airways.
Compounds with lower water solubility or those that are less directly irritating to mucosa (eg, cadmium and mercury fumes, mustard gas, oxides of nitrogen causing Silo-filler’s disease, and phosgene) tend to deposit in the lower, smaller airways. There, they induce pneumonitis and potentially direct respiratory mucosal damage, leading to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Asphyxiation (due to oxygen displacement or alterations of cellular metabolism) and systemic toxicity may also occur depending on the exposure.
The less water-soluble compounds, such as phosgene, can cause delayed toxicity hours to days after the exposure. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The majority of exposures result in pulmonary irritation, causing reactive airway symptoms (more clinically significant in those with underlying airway disease). Patients will often be tachypneic with adventitious breath sounds.
Upper airway irritation may present with nasal/oropharyngeal pain, edema, cough, stridor, or voice changes.
Radiographic Evaluation
A history of exposure to an irritant gas or any symptoms should prompt acquisition of a chest radiograph. It is often normal at the time of presentation, so a repeat radiograph after 6 h may be warranted if symptoms are ongoing.
Blood gases may be helpful if there is concern for acute lung injury.
Therapeutic Considerations
Evaluation of airway integrity, supplemental oxygen, and beta agonists are mainstays of treatment for inhalation injuries related to chemical exposures.
The need for intubation is similar to that of thermal burns.
Signs of oropharyngeal trauma/burn, inability to tolerate secretions, edema, stridor, change in phonation, respiratory worsening, and altered mental status should prompt early intubation.
If intubation is required, a lung-protective ventilation strategy should be employed (ie, tidal volumes of 4-6 mL/kg). 
For patients with symptoms limited to the upper respiratory tract and a history of exposure to only highly-soluble agents, an observation period of 6 h is usually appropriate, unless symptoms are severe.
Longer observation periods are recommended for people with significant exposure to low-solubility agents (eg, phosgene, nitrogen oxides) as these have been shown to cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema ~12-72 h after exposure. 
Chlorine and chloramine are among the most common substances involved in toxic inhalations. In addition to the above-mentioned interventions, nebulized 2% sodium bicarbonate can be considered as a respiratory therapy adjunct, though data on its efficacy and effect on outcome are mixed. 
Hydrofluoric acid
Epidemiology
Hydrogen fluoride or hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a highly reactive acid that exists as a colorless gas or liquid with a strong, irritating odor.
HF is used commercially in glass etching, leather tanning, petroleum refining, the fluorine industry, and in the manufacture of electronic components, fire extinguishers, and steel/aluminum.
HF can be found in consumer products including automobile wheel cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, rust remover, and insecticide.
There were 943 human exposures to HF or substances containing HF reported to poison control centers in 2017. 
Most accidental exposures are occupational and dermal, and primarily affect the extremities (most commonly the hands). However, exposures can occur via inhalation, oral, and ocular routes as well. 
Consumer products typically contain much lower concentrations of HF than are found in commercial/industrial products.
Mortalities have been reported from dermal exposures to near-100% HF with as low as 2.5% total body surface area exposed. 
Pathophysiology
Due to its chemical properties, HF penetrates deeply into tissues, allowing the fluoride ion to bind both intracellular and extracellular calcium, eventually causing cell dysfunction and death with potentially life-threatening systemic hypocalcemia. Fluoride also binds magnesium and manganese, disrupting enzyme function. 
The minimal lethal dose in humans is approximately 1 mg/kg of fluoride ion. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The effects of dermal exposure depend on the concentration, volume, and time exposed. Higher concentrations of HF typically produce immediate pain, while exposure to lower concentrations (such as those in household rust remover products) may have a delayed presentation (ie, pain several hours after the exposure).
Immediate onset of pain is often an indication of a more concentrated exposure and should alert the clinician to the potential for life-threatening effects.
Exposed dermal tissue initially appears normal, then hyperemic. As necrosis and calcium chelation occur, tissues may become ulcerated, frankly necrotic, or white.  Photo
The inhalation of HF can cause upper airway irritation, mucosal burns, hypoxemia, and stridor. Inhalational injuries should be considered potentially life-threatening. 
HF ingestion causes severe gastritis, resulting in abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. HF is rapidly absorbed from the mucosa, causing systemic toxicity and likely death. 
Any route of HF exposure can cause life-threatening systemic toxicity. Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia can result in fatal dysrhythmias, due to fluoride’s chelation of these divalent cations. Though it is a mechanism that is not as well understood, hyperkalemia is often noted in the period just prior to death. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Serial monitoring of serum electrolytes (eg, calcium, magnesium, potassium) and ECGs should occur after any industrial-strength dermal exposure or any concentration of ingested or inhaled HF exposure.
Prolonged QTc (secondary to hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia) and peaked T waves (hyperkalemia) are markers of severe systemic toxicity, preceding ventricular dysrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse.
Patients with dilute (6%-11%) HF dermal exposures, such as those seen with household rust remover, are unlikely to develop systemic toxicity if there is only a small body surface area involved (eg, fingertips), and laboratory testing is not required unless there are complicating features (eg, comorbidity, electrolyte abnormalities, unreliable history). 
Therapeutic Considerations
Decontamination is the first and most important therapeutic step. This includes removing contaminated clothing and immediate copious irrigation for at least 30 min to remove/dilute remaining HF.
Due to the rapid tissue penetration of HF, irrigation alone is insufficient, and all patients should be evaluated in the ED.
Intravenous access and continuous cardiac monitoring should be established early in the patient’s course for any exposure other than a dilute fingertip injury.
Electrolyte repletion with magnesium and calcium should be started prior to the return of any lab results for any unstable patient with a cardiac dysrhythmia, significant QTc prolongation, or history of significant exposure (eg, highly concentrated dermal exposure or ingestion).
Calcium gluconate gel should be applied to/massaged into all exposed dermal areas. The calcium forms insoluble salts with HF, preventing deeper tissue penetration and chelating endogenous divalent cations.
To make calcium gel, add 3.5 g of calcium gluconate powder to 150 mL of a sterile water-soluble lubricant; alternatively, mix 25 mL of 10% calcium gluconate in 75 mL of sterile water-soluble lubricant.
Calcium chloride or calcium carbonate can be substituted if calcium gluconate is unavailable. 
A common method to make a topical calcium slurry involves crushing calcium carbonate tablets (Tums or similar product) and mixing the powder in a water-soluble lubricant. This slurry can then be placed in a surgical glove and the patient’s hand inserted into the glove to allow for maximal contact time to the calcium. 
Although controversial, it is often recommended that nails be removed for fingertip exposures that show signs of skin changes to prevent pooling of HF under the nail and allow for exposure of the affected area to topical treatments. 
“Hexafluorine” (Laboratoire Prevor, Valmondois, France) is a chelator designed to decontaminate HF. However, study results are mixed and do not support its routine use in place of irrigation and topical calcium. 
Topical gel therapy is expected to begin to provide relief within minutes of application. If there is no amelioration of pain in this timeframe, intradermal therapy with calcium gluconate can be considered.
This involves injection of no more than 0.5 mL/cm2 of 5% calcium gluconate distal to the area of injury.
Intradermal injection is not recommended for administration in the hand due to the risk of compartment syndrome.
Calcium chloride should not be used for this method due to the sclerotic nature of the chloride formulation.
Consider risks of intradermal injection, which include worsening tissue injury, infection, and compartment syndrome. 
For recalcitrant pain and/or hand/digit exposure not amenable to intradermal calcium, arterial injection of calcium gluconate can be considered.
Arterial access should be obtained proximal to the injury, such as the brachial or radial artery for hand exposures.
A solution of 2% calcium gluconate can be made by mixing 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate in 40 mL of dextrose 5% in water or 0.9% sodium chloride, which can then be infused continuously over 4 h. Undiluted 10% calcium gluconate and calcium chloride are not recommended due to the risk of tissue and vessel wall injury.
The risks of intra-arterial injection include vessel spasm, hematoma, extravasation, inflammation at the puncture site, and a decrease in blood magnesium. Hypercalcemia is not usually of concern due to the dilute nature of the infusion. 
Patients receiving intra-arterial therapy should be admitted to the hospital as they often require more than one treatment.
Regional IV calcium infusions have also been used with the Bier block technique.
This technique involves mixing 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate in 30 to 40 mL of 0.9% normal saline injected intravenously to the affected limb. Ischemia is maintained via tourniquet for 20-25 min with the pneumatic tourniquet and then deflated over 3-5 min.
In case series, this technique had 71% success, and pain was resolved within 20 min of tourniquet release for responders. 
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous renal replacement therapy in addition to electrolyte repletion have successfully been utilized in the treatment of an HF-poisoned patient. 
Only patients with minor fingertip exposures, normal labs, baseline ECG, and minimal symptoms should be considered for discharge.",Chemical Burns
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Emergency dermatologic conditions are rare but, when present, are typically the result of:
Infection - eg: MRSA
Drug reaction - eg: sulfa drugs
Immune condition
Patients are at risk for dehydration and infection and thus should be placed on a continuous cardiopulmonary monitor and have IV access established.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) require aggressive resuscitation and tailored therapy, preferably in a burn unit.
Key Concepts
Critical rashes associated with mucosal lesions, blistering, or desquamating skin are often caused by infections, drug eruptions, or immune disorders.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common etiology of skin and soft tissue infections; infections should be diagnosed clinically and treated empirically, even without definitive proof of infection.
Medication reactions are common and may result from any medication, typically within 4-21 d of taking the medication.
Allergic reactions are common. When possible, the allergen should be identified and removed. Treatment should be initiated with antihistamines and steroids.
Signs and symptoms such as pruritus, urticaria, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, or pyoderma gangrenosum may indicate an underlying systemic disease.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Primary and secondary lesions should be identified.
Primary lesions arise directly from the underlying disease process.
Secondary lesions result from scratching, treatment, healing, or complicating infection.
Rashes should be described using standardized terminology.
The distribution of the rash often suggests the etiology.
Most rashes do not warrant any laboratory testing in the ED.
Treatment
Airway, breathing, and circulation should be evaluated first and stabilized, if necessary.
Allergic reactions are typically managed with steroids and antihistamines; however, when severe (anaphylaxis) or affecting 2 or more organ systems, epinephrine is life-saving.
Infectious lesions should be treated with the appropriate antibiotic, typically to cover MRSA and other Gram-positive organisms.
Inflammatory rashes should be treated with the lowest-effective-potency topical steroid.
Disposition
Most patients with skin conditions can be managed with outpatient treatment and follow-up with a primary care physician or dermatologist.
Life-threatening conditions that put the patient at risk for dehydration or infection require inpatient treatment.",Emergency Dermatologic Conditions
"Deep Dive
Background
The skin is composed of 3 layers: the epidermis, dermis, and SC layers.
The skin serves as a barrier to the external environment.
The skin protects against external toxins and microbes.
The skin plays a role in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and temperature homeostasis.
Epidemiology
Diseases of the skin and soft tissues account for approximately 4% of ED visits.
Skin diseases cause a significant health burden in the U.S., with an estimated cost of $75 billion annually. 
A wide variety of dermatologic disorders may be encountered in emergency medicine, ranging from minor to life-threatening conditions.
Common categories of skin disorders among ED patients include: 
Infectious: Cellulitis, abscess, dermatophytosis, zoster, erythema multiforme
Inflammatory/allergic: Atopy (eczema), contact dermatitis, urticaria
Drug-induced
Simple: Morbilliform rash, EM
Complex: SJS or TEN
Autoimmune: Psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid
Pathophysiology
Skin is colonized and interfaces with many microorganisms; dermatologic conditions arise when there is a host–microorganism imbalance and immune dysregulation.
Host factors can be endogenous (age, genetics, comorbidities, prior exposures) or exogenous (climate, hygiene, occupation, trauma).
Microorganisms vary by location on the body, but the most abundant organisms (Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium spp.) are found in moist areas.
Diagnostic Considerations
A dermatologic history should include time of onset, duration of symptoms, and relation to any new potential allergens.
Relevant past medical history should include medical/skin conditions, medications, illicit drug use, allergies, recent travel, and sunlight exposure.
Primary and secondary lesions should be identified. Primary lesions arise directly from the underlying disease process. Secondary lesions result from scratching, treatment, healing, or complicating infection.
Assess for Nikolsky’s sign: Gentle rubbing of the skin results in sloughing of the top layer of the epidermis.
Chronic pruritus may be a symptom of systemic illness, such as anemia, renal disease, cholestasis, polycythemia, lymphoma, malignancy, or thyroid disease.
Clinical Presentation
History should include onset of rash, appearance, affected areas, and associated symptoms, such as pain, pruritus, or systemic illness.
Physical exam should include all areas of the skin.
Lesions should be characterized by type Table and distribution. Table
Laboratory Evaluation
Laboratory tests are not necessary for most dermatologic presentations.
Specific tests may be indicated in the appropriate clinical setting, such as serologic testing for secondary syphilis, heterophile antibodies (mononuclear spot test or Monospot), or throat swabs for rapid testing and culture of Group A streptococcus.
Adjunctive skin tests may be considered, including KOH prep for fungi and yeast, Tzanck smear for herpes or varicella, and/or Gram stain for bacteria.
For critically ill patients, relevant laboratory tests typically include CBC and metabolic panel with blood cultures and, much less frequently, lumbar puncture.",Emergency Dermatologic Conditions

Therapeutic Considerations
Withdraw the offending agent.
Treat localized minor reactions with topical steroids.
Treat more systemic reactions with H1 + H2 blockers and oral steroids.
Systemic steroids are indicated for the treatment of DRESS syndrome.
Severe reactions such as TEN, SJS, DRESS syndrome, and hypersensitivity reactions warrant hospital admission, to a burn unit if possible.
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)
Diagnostic Considerations
SJS and TEN are the same disease on a spectrum, with the level of skin detachment differentiating the two entities:
SJS is characterized by an involvement of <10% of the body surface area (BSA).

"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
All patients require continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring and IV access.
Signs or symptoms of hemodynamic instability require immediate stabilization.
Intubation for respiratory distress (eg, stridor, airway edema, pooling secretions).
Crystalloid resuscitation for hypotension.
Consider sepsis in febrile patients and administer IV broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Transfuse blood products as needed when an active hemorrhage is present.
Obtain an emergency head CT to evaluate for intracranial pathology in a patient with purpura and altered mental status, neurologic deficits, headache, or vomiting.
Diagnostic algorithm Figure
Key Concepts
Petechiae and purpura are flat, non-blanching, erythematous or purple skin lesions resulting from extravasation of blood into the skin. Typically, lesions ≤2 mm are considered petechiae, those 3-9 mm are purpura, and those ≥10 mm are referred to as ecchymoses.
The differential diagnosis for the etiology of petechiae and purpuric rashes is broad, ranging from benign conditions such as facial petechiae due to vomiting, to life-threatening, time-sensitive disorders such as meningococcal sepsis. As such, the pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic characteristics of the rash will be dependent on its specific etiology. Photo
Timely diagnosis of the cause of purpura is imperative in the ED setting.
Algorithm The first critical branch points when evaluating a patient with purpura are: 1) To determine whether the patient is febrile and/or ill-appearing or toxic; and 2) to obtain basic lab tests, including a CBC, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR), and a CMP. These features have important implications, not only for pathophysiology but also for immediate treatment and ultimate prognosis.
Patients who appear well with an established benign etiology for their purpura can be safely discharged from the ED.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Acquiring a thorough history is vital to narrowing the differential diagnosis; it should include vaccines, food exposure, medications, fevers, weight loss, recent illnesses, chronic illnesses, pregnancy, a history of thrombotic events, and a family history of bleeding diathesis.
The physical exam should be directed at:
Checking for signs of active hemorrhage, which may manifest as shock, altered mental status, vomiting, or peritonitis.
Identifying signs/symptoms that may direct toward the underlying etiology:
Palpable purpura in the lower extremities → Henoch Schönlein purpura
Hepatosplenomegaly
Facial petechiae
Diagnostic testing in the ED is directed at determining the underlying etiology of the purpura, as well as assessing end-organ function.
CBC to check for thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukocytosis or leukopenia.
PT/PTT/INR to assess clotting factors.
Fibrinogen and D-dimer to evaluate for disseminated intravascular coagulation.
CMP to check for hepatic failure, renal failure, and electrolyte derangement.
Blood cultures and lactate in febrile or septic patients.
More specialized testing is typically out of the scope of the ED and reserved for the inpatient setting or after consultation with a specialist
Treatment
Unstable Patients
Immediate volume resuscitation in the patient with signs of shock.
If the patient is febrile, initiate treatment for sepsis.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics based on the suspected source and hospital-specific antibiogram.
Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation.
Initiation of vasopressors as needed.
Evidence of active hemorrhage:
Transfuse products based on laboratory results.
1-2 units platelets for thrombocytopenia with a goal of reaching a platelet level of 50 ×109/L.
Packed red blood cells for symptomatic anemia.
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for elevated PT/INR and PTT.
Do not routinely transfuse solely based on abnormal labs. Transfusions should be reserved for patients with signs of active hemorrhage and should be given with caution in certain consumptive disorders (ie, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura) where plasma exchange may prove beneficial.
Stable Patients
Supportive therapy is typically sufficient, including:
Correction of dehydration and/or electrolyte disturbances.
Control of hypertension in the presence of renal insufficiency, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Nicardipine or nifedipine
Pain control.
Definitive treatment is determined by the underlying etiology of the purpuric rash.
Disposition
Disposition depends on the patient’s hemodynamic stability, as well as the probable underlying cause of purpura.
Any unstable patient or one with suspected sepsis should be admitted to the ICU for further management.
Any patient with an undetermined cause of purpura should likely be hospitalized to facilitate the diagnostic work-up and for observation of clinical deterioration.
Discharge is possible in many patients with purpuric rashes, provided they are hemodynamically stable, have a benign underlying diagnosis (eg, Henoch Schönlein purpura, facial petechiae, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, etc.), and have a reliable follow-up. Photo",Purpuric Rashes
"Deep Dive
Background
Purpura in the setting of critical illness may arise with multiple systemic conditions, including trauma, lymphoproliferative disorders, malignancies, sepsis, liver failure, etc. These etiologies are discussed elsewhere in this book. This chapter will focus on other important etiologies that may lead a patient to develop purpura and a toxic appearance, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Purpura in the well-appearing patient will also be briefly discussed.
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation and Purpura Fulminans
Epidemiology
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired condition characterized by overactivation of coagulation leading to deposition of thrombin in the microvasculature, which causes microthrombi formation, while simultaneously causing overconsumption of platelets and plasma clotting factors, which results in the potential for severe bleeding. 
DIC is a result of extensive endothelial damage, which has been associated with several clinical conditions including sepsis, trauma, malignancy, obstetric catastrophes, severe immunologic reactions, and heat stroke. 
Purpura fulminans is a highly thrombotic subtype of DIC that carries a very high mortality rate of up to 60%. It is most commonly seen in children, with a bimodal distribution of 1-3 y and 16-18 y old. It is often seen in sepsis, with up to 20% of patients with meningococcal disease developing purpura fulminans.  Photo
Pathophysiology
The initial step in the pathophysiology of DIC is activation of a systemic inflammatory response due to the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6.  The release of these factors may be due to endothelial damage from direct trauma, a snake bite, or severe hypoxia from hemorrhage, sepsis, anaphylaxis, etc.  These factors may also be released directly from malignant cells. 
Once the inflammatory response is triggered, it initiates the clotting cascade through the release of tissue factor from both endothelial and mononuclear cells. Tissue factor activates the extrinsic clotting pathway by binding to factor VIIa, causing activation of platelets, as well as factors VIII, V, XI, and XIII. Overactivation of the clotting cascade leads to depletion of the circulating anticoagulants, antithrombin, protein S, and protein C, which leads to unregulated thrombosis. Tissue factor-VIIa complex also activates neutrophils, allowing continued perpetuation of the inflammatory cycle. 
Purpura fulminans is thought to result from dysfunction of protein C as a natural anticoagulant. The normal function of protein C is to bind to thrombomodulin on endothelial cells. This complex subsequently inhibits coagulation by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa. Although the exact pathophysiology of purpura fulminans is unclear, it is thought that direct endothelial cell damage (eg, arising from endotoxin release during sepsis) leads to destruction of thrombomodulin and inactivation of protein C, which results in uninhibited thrombosis. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Bleeding is the predominant symptom in ~50% of patients. This may manifest as spontaneous petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis, or with oozing from catheter sites, bleeding from venipuncture sites, or mucosal bleeding. 
Approximately 5% of patients will show a predominance of thrombosis over the hemorrhagic process during DIC, as evidenced by thrombophlebitis, renal impairment, or greyish discoloration of the fingertips, toes, or ear lobes. Thrombophlebitis in this population may present as purpura fulminans. 
Purpura fulminans begins as erythematous macules on the trunk and extremities, progressing rapidly to indurated, non-blanching papules with thin, irregular, advancing borders. Lesions may progress to full-thickness necrosis of the skin within 24-48 h. 
Patients will also display signs and symptoms of the underlying disorder leading to DIC (eg, sepsis, trauma, malignancy, etc.).
Laboratory Evaluation
Elevated PT and aPTT occur in the vast majority of patients with DIC, reflecting the systemic depletion of coagulation factors.  Elevations in PT and aPTT are not specific to DIC and can be seen in other conditions such as liver failure and vitamin K deficiency.
Moderate thrombocytopenia (50-100 × 109/L) is observed in the majority of patients with DIC, with only 10%-15% of patients showing severe thrombocytopenia (<50 × 109/L). Those with severe thrombocytopenia are at a 4-5× increased risk of severe bleeding. 
Fibrinogen has traditionally been described as being low in DIC.  However, fibrinogen levels may be misleading, since it is an acute-phase protein, and therefore its plasma concentration can be preserved for a significant length of time even in the presence of massive consumption. 
D-dimer levels are typically elevated in DIC, but are notoriously non-specific and may be elevated in other syndromes such as pulmonary embolism, recent surgery, etc.
Specific assays for the detection of low protein C, protein S, and antithrombin levels can be helpful for prognosis prediction but are not readily available in the ED.
Purpura fulminans is a clinical diagnosis in the setting of DIC, requiring a high index of suspicion early in the patient’s course. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Patients presenting with DIC are typically critically ill, requiring aggressive and immediate therapy. Treatment is directed first at stabilizing hemodynamic instability, followed by therapy directed at the underlying cause of DIC.
If sepsis is suspected as the underlying cause of DIC, initiation of volume resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy are imperative.
Adjunct therapies are directed at the consumptive coagulopathy and/or thrombosis of DIC.
Platelets and/or FFP transfusion should not be given based on lab results alone. Transfusion should be reserved for patients with active hemorrhage or those with severe thrombocytopenia who require an invasive procedure.  In this second instance, platelets should be transfused in increments of 1-2 units with a goal of >50 × 109/L. 
Routine use of heparin and other anticoagulants remains controversial. Large randomized controlled trials of their use in sepsis patients with and without DIC have failed to show survival benefit. However, smaller studies and post-hoc analysis of databases suggest that there may be a benefit when given in subgroups of patients with early, sepsis-induced DIC.  Regardless, heparin is indicated in DIC with the predominance of thrombotic symptoms and in purpura fulminans (Levi, 2018; Colling, 2018; Rajagopal, 2017).  Elevated aPTT is not a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy, since this is artificially elevated due to thrombosis rather than bleeding tendency. 
Evidence for the benefit of the use of activated protein C, recombinant thrombomodulin, and antithrombin infusions has not yet been established.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)
Epidemiology
TTP is a rare systemic disease caused by platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in the microvasculature, leading to hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and organ ischemia and infarction. The annual prevalence of TTP is ~10 cases/million people. 
TTP is much more common in adults than children.
Pathophysiology
TTP is a thrombotic microangiopathy. It stems from a deficiency in A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13), which is a protease that cleaves large von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers into smaller proteins. Without this breakdown of multimers, vWF accumulates and causes platelet aggregation and activation, leading to microthrombi and end-organ damage. 
In acquired TTP (accounting for ~98% of TTP cases), IgG auto-antibodies directed against ADAMTS-13 lead to the inhibition of its proteolytic activity, as well as circulating ADAMTS-13-specific immune complexes.  In hereditary TTP, patients have mutations in ADAMSTS-13.
There are multiple subgroups of TTP, with idiopathic TTP being the most common. Other common subgroups/etiologies of TTP include HIV, bacterial infection, pregnancy, drug-induced, malignancy, and pancreatitis. 
TTP tends to result in more significant problems in end organs as compared with other thrombotic microangiopathies.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The classic clinical pentad of fever, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, and neurologic symptoms is obsolete, with less than 10% of patients presenting in this manner. 
Almost all patients will have thrombocytopenia and anemia, and may present with signs and symptoms corresponding to this, including petechiae/purpura, mucosal hemorrhage, weakness, tachycardia, jaundice, etc.
Other signs and symptoms will depend on which end organ is involved in the disease process, with:
Approximately 60% showing neurologic symptoms such as headache, confusion, seizure, or stroke.
Approximately 35% of patients demonstrating gastrointestinal involvement, ranging from abdominal pain and diarrhea to mesenteric ischemia.
Approximately 25% with signs/symptoms of cardiac involvement up to and including acute myocardial infarction.
Renal involvement is typically relatively mild, with proteinuria and/or hematuria but without acute renal failure. 
Despite thrombocytopenia, clinically significant bleeding is rare in patients with TTP.
Radiographic Evaluation
There are no imaging studies specific to TTP, and as such, any radiographic evaluation should be based on clinical presentation and directed toward the organ system involved.
Laboratory Evaluation
Severe thrombocytopenia (<30 × 109/L) and hemolytic anemia, as demonstrated by schistocytes on peripheral smear, are almost universal in TTP patients. 
In addition to the CBC and manual review of a peripheral smear, diagnosis should be based on the clinical history and physical exam. Other lab evaluations help to rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia, evaluate the severity of end-organ dysfunction, and check for any infectious or immune-inciting event. 
PT/INR, PTT, Coombs, and fibrinogen are typically normal (unlike DIC).
Increased lactate dehydrogenase and elevated indirect bilirubin as well as decreased haptoglobin are seen as a result of hemolysis.
Troponin may be elevated with cardiac involvement.
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine may be elevated, but typically to an extent less than that in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
Blood and urine cultures, CMP, lipase, and other screening tests (HIV, anti-nuclear antibody, etc.) may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of TTP.
Assays for ADAMTS-13 activity and inhibitor levels in the blood can confirm the diagnosis, but the results are not typically available in the ED. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting these results.
The PLASMIC prediction model estimates the likelihood of TTP (Li, 2018). Each of the following features increases the risk of TTP. Patients with <6 features are unlikely to have TTP, with a negative predictive value of 98%:
Platelets <30 × 109/L.
Hemolysis with a reticulocyte count >2.5%, indirect bilirubin >2 mg/dL, or low haptoglobin.
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) <90 fL.
INR <1.5.
Creatinine <2 mg/dL.
No current cancer.
No transplanted organs or stem cells.
Therapeutic Considerations
The foundation of therapy for TTP is based on the removal of anti-ADAMTS-13 antibodies, as well as replenishment of functioning ADAMTS-13 with emergency plasma exchange therapy. Prompt initiation of plasma exchange therapy decreases the overall mortality rate of a first episode of TTP from >90% to 10%-20%.  It is often initiated in consultation with a hematologist and requires placement of a dialysis catheter.
The patient’s plasma volume (40 mL/kg) should be exchanged during each session.
Daily plasma exchange should be continued for 2 d after improvement of platelets to >150 × 109/L. 
If plasma exchange is unavailable, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion may be used as a temporizing measure. FFP will replace ADAMTS-13, but does not remove the IgG auto-antibodies responsible for inactivating ADAMTS-13.  FFP should be administered while arranging transfer to a hospital with plasma exchange capability. It should not delay transferring the patient for definitive treatment with plasma exchange therapy.
Patients should also receive steroids (eg, prednisone 1 mg/kg PO). Patients with severe neurologic signs (eg, encephalopathy) may benefit from high doses of IV methylprednisolone (eg, 125 mg). Steroids reduce the production of auto-antibodies.
For TTP refractory to plasma exchange therapy, rituximab has been shown to be effective. Rituximab is undergoing study as a potential first-line agent and should be given in consultation with a hematologist. 
Platelet transfusions are only needed for an active, life-threatening hemorrhage. Transfusing platelets may worsen symptoms by providing more fuel to the consumptive process, thus leading to more thrombus deposition in the microvasculature.  However, patients with clinically significant bleeding should receive platelets. 
If TTP is not identified and treated, it results in neurologic complications, myocardial ischemia, renal failure, and potentially death.
Relapse occurs in up to 36% of patients over a 10-y period, and patients with residual low ADAMTS-13 activity are at a higher risk of relapse. 
Regular monitoring of ADAMTS-13 activity during follow-up is indicated, with prophylactic rituximab infusions indicated in patients with activity levels <10%. 
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)
Epidemiology
HUS is also a thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia that occurs on a spectrum with TTP; however, unlike TTP, HUS is associated with prominent renal impairment or renal failure. 
HUS is rare and occurs primarily in children, afflicting <0.003% of children <5 y old annually.
HUS is more common in summer.
Pathophysiology
The feature common to all HUS is endothelial cell damage, leading to activation of inflammatory pathways and microthrombosis. 
Typical HUS is associated with bloody diarrhea and is due to shiga toxin-producing E. coli in 85%-90% of cases.  E. coli 0157:H7 is the primary strain leading to HUS. It is found in undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk, fruits, and vegetables. It can spread from one child to another.
HUS can also arise following infection with shigella, HIV, or pneumococcus.
Shiga toxin induces cell injury, mainly through inhibition of protein synthesis. This leads to direct damage to renal epithelium and endothelium, as well as activation of leukocytes, thus promoting an ongoing inflammatory response and further damage. 
Atypical HUS is a classification given to HUS without bloody diarrhea and is a result of a heterogenous group of etiologies, including inherited disorders, leading to complement dysregulation, cobalamin C defects, and underlying coexisting diseases such as malignancies, those caused by certain drugs, and solid-organ or stem cell transplantation. The incidence of atypical HUS is estimated to be 0.23-0.42 case/million/y in children <17 y old. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Any child with a diarrheal illness followed by signs of bleeding or renal dysfunction should raise concern for HUS.
The clinical presentation of HUS is similar to that of TTP. Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia manifest as purpura, bleeding, fatigue, pallor, and shortness of breath.
In addition, patients with HUS typically have a preceding illness with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea from shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Patients with HUS arising from pneumococcus often have pneumonia instead of bloody diarrhea.
1-2 wk after the diarrheal illness, patients develop signs and symptoms of renal involvement, including hypertension, edema, and oliguria or anuria. 
Severe dehydration is associated with a poor prognosis. 
Patients may also have neurologic involvement with encephalopathy or seizures.
Radiographic Evaluation
Renal U/S should be obtained in patients presenting with findings consistent with acute renal injury or renal failure to evaluate for alternate etiologies.
Laboratory Evaluation
Initial work-up is similar to that for TTP, including:
CBC with peripheral smear: Hemoglobin <8 g/dL, platelets <140 × 109/L, and schistocytes.
PT/INR, PTT, Coombs, fibrinogen: Normal (similar to TTP), but dissimilar to DIC.
Increased D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and indirect bilirubin with a decreased haptoglobin secondary to hemolysis.
CMP: Elevated BUN, creatinine, and bilirubin; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may be elevated with liver involvement.
Urinalysis: Hematuria, proteinuria.
Blood and urine cultures.
HIV and autoimmune screening tests.
Stool culture is indicated in those patients with bloody diarrhea, but the results are not typically available in the ED. PCR testing for E. coli may be available in many EDs.
Therapeutic Considerations
Initial treatment should focus on supportive care, including red blood cell transfusions, judicious control of hypertension, and careful management of fluid and electrolyte status. 
Most children with HUS require blood transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin >8 g/dL. With concomitant renal failure, it is important to administer blood slowly over 4 h to prevent pulmonary edema.
Administer calcium channel blockers (eg, nicardipine, nifedipine) in patients with hypertension.
Intravascular fluids should be administered in patients with clinical signs of dehydration; however, these must be balanced so as not to precipitate pulmonary edema.
Hyperkalemia should be treated with standard therapy (eg, calcium for myocardial stabilization, etc.). Renal failure, hyperkalemia, or severe pulmonary edema requiring hemodialysis is required in up to 50% of patients. 
As with TTP, platelet transfusions are only required in patients with severe bleeding.
Unlike TTP, there is no evidence that platelet transfusions fuel thrombi formation. Likewise, there is no evidence showing benefit to plasma exchange therapy.
Outcomes are generally good for typical HUS, with one study showing 78% of patients making a full recovery, 24% of patients developing stage I chronic kidney disease, and 5% of patients dying or surviving in a permanent vegetative state. 
Specific treatment for atypical HUS is more complex given the heterogeneity of etiologies for this disease category. Therapy should be directed at the underlying etiology.
Antiphospholipid Syndrome
Epidemiology
Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by thrombosis and/or pregnancy complications (including repeated fetal loss) due to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies. 
Although approximately 1%-5% of people carry antiphospholipid antibodies, the general prevalence of antiphospholipid syndrome is 40-50 cases/100,000, with an incidence of 5/100,000/y. 
Antiphospholipid syndrome is commonly associated with autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus.
Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is a very rare variant consisting of rapid development of microthrombi with end-organ damage leading to multi-organ dysfunction and failure. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome accounts for <1% of all cases of antiphospholipid syndrome. 
Pathophysiology
Symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome are the result of antiphospholipid antibodies acting through 3 separate mechanisms: 
Thrombosis is mediated by the direct inhibition of the anticoagulant effects of the protein C system, as well as the inhibition of β2-glycoprotein I, resulting in inhibition of fibrinolysis.
Direct activation of endothelial cells and monocytes results in further inflammation and thrombosis.
Direct activation of the complement cascade leads to clotting.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Given that antiphospholipid syndrome is caused by thrombosis of venous or arterial vessels, the presentation is varied based on the location of the affected vasculature.
Venous thrombosis is more common than arterial thrombosis, often leading to deep vein thrombosis.
Arterial thrombi are most often present in the brain, leading to cerebrovascular accidents.
Thrombi also form in the lungs and on the valves of the heart. Less commonly, thrombi form in the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, adrenal glands, and eyes.
Thrombocytopenia may be present in up to 30% of patients, leading to purpuric skin lesions. 
Cutaneous thrombosis may present with livedo reticularis, ulcers, digital gangrene, or cutaneous necrosis.
Livedo reticularis, which consists of a net-like pattern of violaceous rings, is the most common sign in the skin. It is more often found in patients with arterial thrombi.
In pregnancy, antiphospholipid syndrome causes fetal death at >10 wk gestation and premature labor with preeclampsia or placental insufficiency.
Laboratory Evaluation
Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is made if the patient has at least one clinical criterion and one lab criterion: 
Clinical
Vascular thrombosis
Pregnancy morbidity
1+ unexplained fetal death >10 wk
1+ premature birth <34 wk due to preeclampsia/eclampsia
3+ consecutive spontaneous abortions
Laboratory
Lupus anticoagulant
Anticardiolipin antibody
Anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibody
Thrombocytopenia (<140,000/μL), anemia, and prolonged PTT.
Therapeutic Considerations
For thrombotic events, treatment is centered around anticoagulation, typically heparin or low-molecular weight heparin followed by warfarin in non-pregnant patients. Aspirin and low-molecular weight heparin are appropriate for obstetric presentations.
The direct oral anticoagulants appear to provide less adequate anticoagulation than warfarin for arterial thrombi.
Patients with thrombi in the brain, eye, heart, or gastrointestinal tract are managed in the same manner as those without antiphospholipid syndrome.
Lifelong anticoagulation therapy is necessary in patients who have already experienced thrombotic events.  The optimal anticoagulants for preventing thrombus recurrence are unclear.
Monitoring of PTT and INR to assess anticoagulation may be difficult in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, who may have abnormalities in these lab values prior to anticoagulation.
For catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, unfractionated heparin with a high dose of steroids is the initial treatment of choice. 
The survival rate is 91%. Many patients experience significant morbidity despite continued anticoagulation therapy.  10% of patients will experience recurrent thrombosis if not anticoagulated.
Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)
Epidemiology
Heparin is a widely used anticoagulant that acts to inhibit the clotting cascade via inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa through an antithrombin-dependent mechanism.
Estimates of the occurrence of HIT in heparin-exposed patients vary from 8%-40%, but complications are rare, with only 0.2%-3% of patients experiencing significant bleeding. 
HIT is more common in women and patients undergoing surgery.
Pathophysiology
HIT is separated into Type I and Type II.
Type I is a non-immune-mediated, direct agglutination of platelets. It is transient, rapid, and typically not clinically relevant.
Type II is caused by an antibody directed against a complex consisting of heparin and a platelet protein known as platelet factor 4 (PF4). This causes platelet activation, resulting in platelet consumption and thrombin generation. 
HIT more commonly arises with unfractionated heparin, but can also occur with low-molecular weight heparin. It may develop at any heparin dose, including prophylactic doses, and with any route of administration. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The manifestations of HIT typically occur within 5-15 d of heparin administration and may also arise several days after the discontinuation of heparin.
The presentation is dependent on the location of thrombosis, with the most common thromboses occurring at sites of vascular injury such as catheter insertion sites. 
Thrombosis occurs in >50% of patients with HIT. 
Skin necrosis at the site of heparin injection should raise suspicion of HIT.
Hemorrhage occurs in <10% of patients.
Thombi in the limbs can lead to gangrene, in the brain can lead to cerebrovascular accidents, and in the heart can lead to myocardial infarction.
Laboratory Evaluation
While definitive diagnosis of HIT is made by detection of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, these results are not readily available in the ED.
A more practical approach is to demonstrate the 4 Ts:
Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis that are temporally associated with heparin therapy, and in the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. The 4T score assigns points to each of these criteria and predicts the likelihood of HIT. The negative predictive value of a score <4 is almost 100%, and these patients do not require heparin discontinuation. 
Thrombocytopenia is typically moderate in severity, with platelet levels of 50-70 × 109/L, and it is not typically associated with bleeding.  New thrombocytopenia in a patient receiving heparin should raise concern for HIT.
Thrombocytopenia usually precedes thrombus formation.
Laboratory work-up is therefore similar to that for TTP, including CBC, CMP, coagulation factors, etc., and is directed at ruling out other causes of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment for HIT consists of the immediate discontinuation of all sources of heparin, including all flushes and heparin-impregnated catheters. Discontinuation should be pursued even before confirmation of the diagnosis with anti-PF4/heparin antibodies.
Patients without signs of clinically significant bleeding should receive other anticoagulation to prevent thrombus formation. Direct oral anticoagulants are typically appropriate. If the patient has a new thrombus, IV anticoagulation (eg, bivalirudin) should be administered. Thrombocytopenia without bleeding should not preclude anticoagulation.
Platelet transfusion is reserved only in patients with active, clinically important hemorrhage. 
All patients with potentially newly diagnosed HIT should be admitted to the hospital to confirm the diagnosis and determine ongoing management in consultation with a hematologist.
Increased Intravascular Pressure
Epidemiology
Sharp rises in intravascular pressure can cause extravasation of blood in small vessels, resulting in a localized petechial rash.
Pathophysiology
Any sharp increase in pressure can cause these petechiae, but they typically result from crying, vomiting, coughing, or occasionally from straining with bowel movements.
Petechiae have been reported as a complication of endoscopy. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Patients are well-appearing, and petechiae are typically limited to the face, especially periorbitally. Patients may have petechiae on the neck and chest, but the petechiae do not cross the nipple line.
Radiographic and Laboratory Evaluation
While non-accidental trauma or assault should always be considered with any facial petechiae, no work-up is necessary provided that a history consistent with the above mechanisms is elicited.
Therapeutic Considerations
No treatment is necessary, and petechiae typically resolve within a few days. 
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)
Photo
Epidemiology
ITP is an acquired, immune-mediated syndrome consisting of isolated thrombocytopenia. This may be associated with an increased risk of clinically important bleeding. 
In adults, it has an incidence of 3.3/100,000/y, with a prevalence in children ranging from 1.9-6.4/100,000/y. 
Bleeding risk in children is lower than in adults, with only 3% of children with a platelet count <20 × 109/L having major bleeding on presentation. 
ITP is most common in young women and elderly men.
Pathophysiology
Primary ITP is due to antiplatelet antibodies, impaired megakaryocytopoiesis, and T cell-mediated destruction of platelets, while secondary ITP is associated with other underlying disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosis, HIV, and H. pylori. 
ITP may arise after an infection, particularly with HIV, hepatitis C, and varicella. Antibodies directed against the infection cross-react with platelets, resulting in thrombocytopenia.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
History and physical exam should be aimed at identifying evidence of bleeding and other causes of thrombocytopenia or causes of secondary ITP. 
The typical presentation is an asymptomatic petechial or purpuric rash, usually on the lower legs and appearing in crops. 
⅓ of patients will have no signs or symptoms, with thrombocytopenia only detected on routine lab evaluation. 
Mucocutaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis, menorrhagia, or gingival bleeding, may be seen in up to 12% of patients on presentation. Patients may develop purpura on mucous membranes.
Severe, life-threatening bleeding including intracranial or gastrointestinal hemorrhage is rare on presentation. 
Bleeding risk increases with an age >60 y old and a history of prior bleeding. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Imaging should be based on the clinical suggestion of severe bleeding (ie, non-contrast head CT for headache, vomiting, or altered mental status).
Laboratory Evaluation
CBC and peripheral smear will show isolated thrombocytopenia, with the other cell lines preserved. Platelets may be increased in size, but otherwise have a normal shape.
PT/INR and PTT are normal.
There are no specific lab tests for the diagnosis of ITP. There is no role for bone marrow biopsy in ITP patients, regardless of age. 
Adults should be tested for HIV and hepatitis C, since these are common concomitant infections.
Therapeutic Considerations
Any patient with life-threatening bleeding should be stabilized with volume resuscitation and platelet transfusion. Platelet transfusions do not increase thrombi formation.
Patients aged >60 y old, with platelets <10 × 109/L, chronic ITP, or taking anti-inflammatory drugs are most likely to experience severe bleeding. However, patients without these risk factors can develop significant bleeding.
Adult ITP
Decisions regarding treatment depend on the platelet count, type of bleeding, and risk factors for further bleeding.
Treatment is targeted toward raising the platelet count above the bleeding risk threshold of 20 × 109/L.
Certain patients at a high risk of bleeding (eg, elderly patients with frequent falls) may benefit from a transfusion threshold of 30 × 109/L.
The first-line treatment for patients with platelet counts <30 × 109/L has long been prednisone 1 mg/kg/d for 2-4 wk, with a remission rate of 60%.  High-dose dexamethasone 40 mg PO q24h appears to lead to higher platelet counts and less bleeding in the short-term as compared with prednisone. 
Patients with severe bleeding should also receive IVIG (1 g/kg), which increases the platelet count rapidly within 24-48 h.
Emerging data suggest that high-dose dexamethasone, rituximab, or thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA) may improve primary remission and decrease the rate of splenectomy. 
IVIG may serve as an alternative to splenectomy for recurrent or chronic ITP. 
Patients without significant bleeding can be managed as outpatients with Hematology referral. They should avoid activities that increase their risk of traumatic injuries (eg, contact sports).
Pediatric ITP
Therapy differs from that for adults, since active bleeding rather than the degree of thrombocytopenia serves as the primary indication for treatment initiation.
In children with mild or no bleeding at the time of presentation, corticosteroids or IVIG have been shown to have no benefit over observation alone, regardless of platelet count. 
In children with a high bleeding risk or moderate or severe bleeding, IVIG or prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/d may increase the platelet count. 
Second-line treatments for initial non-responders or relapsing ITP include dexamethasone, rituximab, and TPO-RA. There are ongoing investigations into the role of other immunosuppressants in the treatment of chronic ITP in children, but these data are still inconclusive. 
IgA Vasculitis/Henoch Schönlein Purpura (HSP)
Photo
Epidemiology
HSP is the most common vasculitis in childhood, with an annual incidence of 10-30 cases/100,000/y. 
>90% of patients are <10 y old at diagnosis, with a mean age of 6 y old.  It is relatively rare in adults.
HSP is more common in males and Caucasians.
The majority of HSP cases occur after an antecedent streptococcal or viral illness, often an upper respiratory tract infection. There have also been case reports of HSP presenting after vaccination, with one study showing an increased risk of HSP after MMR vaccine administration. 
Pathophysiology
Symptoms of HSP stem from an immune complex-mediated small vessel vasculitis associated with IgA. 
These complexes deposit in the vessel wall, typically in the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, or glomeruli. Deposition of these complexes leads to activation of complement and local inflammatory response, which in turn leads to vessel wall damage and destruction, as well as extravasation of red blood cells. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Diagnosis of HSP is made clinically and requires the presence of palpable purpura or petechiae with a lower limb predominance, plus at least one of the following: 1) Abdominal pain, 2) arthritis or arthralgia, 3) renal involvement, or 4) leukocytoclastic vasculitis or proliferative glomerulonephritis with IgA deposition on biopsy. 
The majority of patients presenting with HSP are well-appearing and non-toxic, with palpable purpura seen in 100% of patients, joint pain in 74%, renal involvement in 54%, and gastrointestinal complaints in 51%. 
Skin involvement
Initial skin lesions may be non-palpable erythematous macules, petechiae, urticarial, or even appear similar to angioedema. As the lesions progress, they become palpable purpura and may progress to vesiculobullous lesions with or without necrotic ulcers. 
Skin lesions are predominantly located on the lower limbs, with a greater concentration of lesions in gravity-dependent areas and pressure points. 
Edema may arise in the hands, feet, and around the eyes.
Gastrointestinal involvement
Gastrointestinal manifestations may precede the onset of skin manifestations in 10%-40% of patients, sometimes by up to 2 wk, or arise after the rash. 
The most common gastrointestinal presentation is colicky, generalized abdominal pain, which is seen in up to ⅔ of patients with HSP.  Patients often have vomiting. In one study, up to 24% of patients developed hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, suggesting at least some degree of protein-losing enteropathy. In this same study, melena and hematemesis were seen less commonly, in approximately 8% and 1%, respectively. 
Rare but serious complications include intussusception, bowel perforation, and bowel gangrene.
Joint involvement
Typically, patients have an oligoarticular migratory transient arthritis. Large joints involved (knee, ankle, hip) are most commonly inflamed. The arthritis is non-deforming and heals without chronic damage, typically within a few weeks. 
Joint effusions are not usually present.
Renal involvement
Renal manifestations of HSP typically occur within 1-3 mo of onset of illness, with 97% of renal involvement occurring by 6 months. 
The most common finding in patients with renal involvement is microscopic hematuria, but findings may include mild proteinuria, hypertension, as well as nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome, or acute renal failure. 
Renal involvement in adults may lead to end-stage renal disease.
Genitourinary involvement
Patients may develop edema and pain of the scrotum or testicles. Pain may be severe and resemble testicular torsion.
CNS involvement
Rare manifestations of CNS involvement include headache, behavioral changes, irritability, and seizures. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Abdominal imaging should be considered with severe abdominal pain or acute abdomen on exam.
Abdominal U/S should be considered to check for intussusception.
Two-view abdominal radiographs and/or abdominal CT should be considered with suspicion of intestinal ischemia or perforation.
Laboratory Evaluation
As discussed above, HSP is a clinical diagnosis, and lab testing is used to help determine the presence and extent of extra-dermatologic involvement.
UA should be performed in all patients to evaluate for hematuria, proteinuria, and cell casts. It is often normal in the early stages of the disease course.
As with any purpuric or petechial rash, CBC, PT, and PTT should be obtained to check for bleeding diathesis.
A CMP should be obtained to evaluate hepatic function, renal function, presence of hypoalbuminemia, and overall fluid and electrolyte status.
Therapeutic Considerations
While the treatment of HSP remains controversial, it is generally accepted that therapy for all HSP patients begins with supportive care based on the presenting symptoms, including pain control with anti-inflammatory drugs, fluids, electrolyte repletion, and surgical consultation when an acute abdominal process is suspected. 
Short courses of corticosteroids have long been suggested as a therapeutic option, but evidence in the literature is poor and based on case reports or small studies.  Steroids do not alter the course of the disease. Given the lack of high quality, consistent data supporting the use of corticosteroids, we recommend reserving corticosteroids for patients with severe pain.
With regard to renal involvement, most cases of HSP nephritis are mild and self-limiting, with nephritic or nephrotic syndrome clinically evident in only 20% of patients with renal involvement. However, the initial presentation of nephritic or nephrotic syndrome carries a worse prognosis, with 20% of these patients going on to have long-term renal impairment. 
For severe renal involvement, there is no consensus among experts regarding the treatment modality.
Therapies that have been evaluated include corticosteroids, cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and mycophenolate mofetil, among others.
A Cochrane review in 2015 found that there was no evidence of benefit for the use of corticosteroids in the prevention of persistent renal disease. The same review found no evidence of benefit of cyclophosphamide treatment and was unable to determine the benefit of treatment with cyclosporin or mycophenolate mofetil. 
Given the lack of clear evidence in the literature, consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained before any therapy is initiated in the setting of significant renal involvement.
Most cases can be managed as outpatients, with hospitalization necessary for patients with severe symptoms, gastrointestinal bleeding, intussusception, or renal involvement.
Prognosis in the majority of HSP patients is excellent, with complete spontaneous resolution of symptoms. Referral to Gastroenterology, Rheumatology, or Nephrology is based on the severity of signs and symptoms at presentation.",Purpuric Rashes
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
All patients with significant burns or suspicion require cardiopulmonary monitoring and IV access.
Any signs or symptoms of airway compromise or respiratory distress:
Worsening throat pain
Change in phonation
Stridor
Visible swelling of neck
Wheezing
Mucosal burns
warrant consideration of prompt intubation.
If intravascular access cannot be obtained, utilize intraosseous line.
Consider trauma and initiate work-up as needed.
Estimate the burn area plus depth and initiate crystalloid resuscitation.
Parkland formula: total fluid over 24 h with first half given in the first 8 h
Adults: 4 mL lactated Ringer’s × weight (kg) × % total body surface area
Pediatrics: 3 mL lactated Ringer’s × weight (kg) × % total body surface area
Perform escharotomy for circumferential burns.
Provide adequate analgesia for pain control.
Dress wounds with moist saline-soaked bandages and sterile drapes/towels.
Avoid ointments/antiseptic dressings prior to evaluation by burn specialist.
Transfer to burn center after initial stabilization and resuscitation.
Key Concepts
Review major burn EM:RAP 2016 EM:RAP Audio, review 2nd degree burns EM:RAP 2016 EM:RAP Audio
Thermal burns occur when heat or cold disrupts the layers of tissue, causing damage.
Estimate the size and thickness of the burn; do not include superficial burns in this estimate.
Burn size estimation: total body surface area (TBSA)
1% of body area is approximately equal to the area of the palm of the patient’s hand (“rule of palms”).
Rule of Nines Figure
Adults: head 9%, torso 18% each for anterior and posterior side, arm 9%, leg 18%, and genitals 1%.
Children: head 18%, torso 16% each for the anterior and posterior side, arm 10%, and leg 14%.
Lund and Browder is an alternative, more precise method for estimating TBSA that incorporates age-adjusted burn size and depth. 
Describe burns as superficial, superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, or full-thickness; avoid antiquated terms such as first, second, and third degree.
For dressing partial-thickness burns, silver sulfadiazine is no longer routinely recommended due to recently published studies that showed a negative impact on wound healing without clear benefit. Consider bacitracin, mupirocin, or other novel agents. 
Ensuring airway patency followed by fluid resuscitation for large area burns are the most important early interventions. Monitor urine output to ensure adequate volume resuscitation.
Dysphonia, stridor, or the presence of burns or soot in the mouth or nose should raise concern for airway injury. Patients may harbor airway injuries despite normal oropharyngeal examinations, oxygen saturations, and chest radiographs.
Burn centers have criteria for transfer; one important criterion is social situation.
Escharotomy should be performed for circumferential burns, especially those involving the thorax.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Thermal burns are the temperature-mediated disruption of tissue that can temporarily or permanently deform layers of the skin, causing a wide range of injury.
Key historical features
Identify the source of thermal injury; ie, an electrical burn, cold, oil, etc.
Note time of occurrence.
Consider the mechanism of injury and the possibility of concurrent trauma.
Obtain detailed medical history, especially the history as it relates to wound healing (eg, diabetes, immunosuppression, smoking).
Key physical exam features
Completely disrobe the patient to assess the extent of injuries and to remove any sources of ongoing contamination. Maintain normothermia during this process by examining the patient in a warmed environment.
Estimate TBSA and depth using the rule of nines, rule of palms, or Lund-Browder method. Figure
Superficial burns blanch and are red and painful.
Partial-thickness burns are non-blanching, bright red, and often have blisters.
Full-thickness burns can be ashen, gray, or black and are NOT painful.
Assess for burns of the airway, including singed nasal hairs, hoarse voice, or respiratory distress.
Evaluate for concomitant trauma.
CXR should be obtained for any signs or symptoms of airway compromise.
Blood work should be obtained to assess the degree of end-organ dysfunction. This typically includes blood gas, carboxyhemoglobin, CK, UA, CBC, and metabolic panel.
Treatment
Secure airway in patients at risk for respiratory deterioration.
Continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
Large-bore IV access.
Crystalloid resuscitation per the Parkland formula.
An initial fluid bolus is only needed in hypotensive patients.
Adequate analgesia should be given for pain control.
Tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) 0.5 mL IM booster should be given for superficial partial-thickness or greater burn if not received within past 5 y.
If tetanus-prone wound and more than 5 y since last Tdap or unknown if completed primary series, also give tetanus immunoglobulin.
Antibiotic ointment should be applied to burns in all patients being discharged.
Non-adherent bandages or wrappings with large sterile sheets should be applied to patients being admitted/transferred to a burn center.
Disposition
Home
Discharge home may be considered for stable patients with minor/moderate burns or partial-thickness burns less than 10% TBSA and in whom pain control has been achieved.
Adequate outpatient follow-up must be ensured, and burns should be dressed with instructions for management at home (ie, changed twice daily); provide adequate materials to change dressings.
Admission
Patients who do not fit the above criteria and/or who have multiple comorbidities and complex social situations should either be admitted or transferred to a burn center.
Burn center referral criteria are as follows: 
Full-thickness burns.
Partial-thickness burns of 10% or greater TBSA.
Burns involving the hands, face, feet, genitalia, major joints, or perineum.
Electrical, lightning, chemical, or inhalation injury.
Concomitant traumatic injury in which the burn poses greater morbidity and mortality risk.
Patients with comorbidities, leading to immunosuppression or delayed healing, that could complicate recovery.
Patients with social or emotional constraints.
Children.
Surgical Consultation
Those who meet criteria for escharotomy or have sustained trauma should be evaluated by a burn surgeon. Partial- and full-thickness burns often require debridement in the operating room.",Thermal Burns
"Deep Dive
Epidemiology
Approximately 486,000 people each year are treated for burns; only about 10% of those require hospitalization, but about 60% of burn victims require treatment at specialized centers.  The majority of these patients present to the ED.
~70% of burn victims are male, and the age group at highest risk is between 18 and 35 y.
Scalding and fire are the most common causes of thermal burns, though care should also be given to electrical and chemical burns. 
More than 40% of scald injuries occur in children ≤5 y old. 
Overall, more than 96% of patients survive following a burn; however, there are still more than 3,200 burn- or smoke-related deaths each year in the U.S. 
Nearly one-third of hospitalized burn patients with inhalation injury develop major upper airway obstruction. 
Risk factors for poor outcomes from burn injury include advanced age, comorbid conditions, inhalation injury, female sex, and larger burn size.
Pathophysiology
Skin is a semipermeable membrane that serves as environmental protection and aids in the regulation of body temperature, fluid homeostasis, and excretion. It is made up of the superficial epidermis and the deeper dermis. Deeper than both of these layers are subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and bone. Figure
The depth of these layers varies by anatomic location and age. Older patients have relatively thinner skin, and skin tends to be thicker across the palms, soles of the feet, and upper back.
Thermal injury occurs when temperatures exceed 45°C (113°F) and results in disruption of the above homeostatic functions of the skin.
At the cellular level, destruction of the cell membrane from thermal damage causes water and electrolyte shifts, as well as the release of vasoactive substances, including histamine, kinins, and oxygen free radicals.
With inhalation, direct thermal injury damages the airway above the glottis, whereas toxic gases damage the airway more inferiorly. Lung injury may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Other systemic effects of thermal injury can include decreased cardiac output from burns >60% TBSA, metabolic acidosis, increase in blood viscosity and hematocrit, with secondary anemia from extravasation and cell destruction. All of these systemic manifestations of burn injury may affect the patient’s response to resuscitation. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Estimating burn size as a percentage of body surface area is the most important diagnostic component. Burn size, depth, and location guide treatment and disposition.
Only partial-thickness and full-thickness burns are included in burn depth estimation.
The rule of nines is a commonly used method of estimating burn size for both adult and pediatric patients. Figure
Adults: head is 9%, each side of the torso is 18%, each arm is 9%, each leg is 18%, and the genitalia is 1%.
Children: head is 18%, each side of the torso is 16%, each arm is 10%, and each leg is 14%.
Another useful estimation tool is the size of the palm of the patient’s hand, which equates to roughly 1% of the patient’s total body surface area (“rule of palms”).
A third and more precise method commonly used by burn specialists follows the Lund and Browder diagram. It age-adjusts both burn size and depth and is calculated by completing the Lund and Browder diagram. 
Classically, blanching, painful, and red burns are superficial. Superficial burns are not included in the estimation of burn area. Non-blanching, painful, and bright red burns indicate partial-thickness injuries. Partial-thickness burns often blister. Superficial partial-thickness burns involve the epidermis and superficial dermis Photo Photo, while deep partial-thickness burns involve deeper structures of the deep dermis, such as sweat glands and follicles. Photo Photo Full-thickness burns are painless, charred and leathery in texture, and gray or black Photo. Fourth-degree burns (which retain the older nomenclature) are potentially life-threatening injuries that extend to fat, muscle, and bone, and often require multiple surgical interventions. Photo Figure
Intuitively, deeper burns indicate longer healing time, greater scarring potential, greater need for skin grafting/amputation, and greater functional morbidity.
Obtain relevant laboratory tests including CBC, CMP, and CK for major burns. CBC and CMP are helpful for baseline labs and screening for electrolyte disturbances. CK is useful to trend muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis. UA is used to assess the presence of myoglobin.
Other diagnostic tests for patients with severe burns or concomitant inhalation injury should include blood gas, carboxyhemoglobin, CXR, and ECG.
Cyanide poisoning is an important consideration in fire victims with inhalation injury or enclosed fires and may manifest as severe metabolic acidosis.
Additional imaging can be obtained if there is suspicion of traumatic injury. There is no standard routine imaging recommended for burn patients without suspected trauma or a concerning mechanism.
Therapeutic Considerations
For patients being discharged, dress wounds with copious antibiotic ointment and non-adherent dressings. Instruct patients to change dressings twice daily to avoid drying of bandages. They should be advised to take pain medicine shortly before changing dressings if needed.
It is important to update the patient’s tetanus coverage with the vaccine if the patient is not up to date or has not previously received vaccination. Patients without tetanus vaccination should also receive tetanus immunoglobulin.
Systemic antibiotics on initial resuscitation are not necessary.
In patients being admitted, cover burns in saline-soaked gauze or sterile drapes as the wounds will need to be reassessed by burn specialists.
Scrubbing burn wounds is not recommended; they should be cleaned gently with a dilute antiseptic or mild soap and water.
Blister management is somewhat controversial, but consider debriding large painful bullae or those located in regions that will undergo significant strain such as a joint or crease. Otherwise, intact blisters can be left intact.
Silver sulfadiazine, once the mainstay of treatment for partial-thickness and full-thickness burns, has been shown in a recent meta-analysis and critical reviews to have a negative impact on wound healing with no clear anti-infective advantage compared with other agents.  It is also well known to discolor skin and should not beused on the face or in patients with sulfa allergies or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Use with caution in pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children. In general, the routine use of silver sulfadiazine is not recommended unless other agents are unavailable. Alternatives include bacitracin, mupirocin, or other novel agents.
Critical patients with neck edema, wheezing, or burns to the face, mouth, or airway should be intubated early for airway protection and ventilated with 100% humidified oxygen. This is done with the understanding that a patient’s airway may deteriorate quickly due to progressive edema.
Use the Parkland formula as a guide in fluid resuscitation of larger burns of >10%-20% TBSA. Smaller burns do not typically require fluid resuscitation. Both under- and overestimation of burn size and resuscitation can be harmful. Excess fluid administration can lead to compartment syndrome or pulmonary edema, while inadequate fluid can lead to hypoperfusion. Formulas are guidelines only and should be adjusted according to the patient’s baseline status, clinical condition, and response to resuscitation.
Measure the response to resuscitation with vitals signs, perfusion, and urinary output with a goal of 0.5 mL/kg/h in adults and 1 mL/kg/h in children. Carefully document crystalloid resuscitation type (ideally lactated Ringer’s) and volume to facilitate effective handoffs to the admitting team. Patients with major burns should have a Foley catheter placed to monitor urinary output, as should patients with burns to the perineum. Children also require the addition of maintenance fluids to fluid volumes calculated with the Parkland formula.
Burn injuries are exquisitely painful. Aggressive pain control and anxiolysis is a mainstay of therapy, including intravenous opioids. Discharged patients may likewise need oral opioids and anxiolytics at discharge.
Patients with larger area burns (>20% TBSA) may benefit from nasogastric tube insertion due to potential development of ileus.
Pursue early admission or transfer to a burn center for patients who meet burn center criteria (See section: Admission) or are likely to fail outpatient management. This includes the elderly and patients with immune suppression, diabetes, and/or poor social support. Consideration of these features may bring clarity to the decision to admit or transfer. 
Cyanide poisoning should be treated when clinically appropriate, given the time-sensitive nature of the exposure and that confirmatory tests may not result in a reasonable time frame.
Evaluate for traumatic injuries when clinically appropriate; accompanying imaging should correlate with necessary trauma work-up.
Perform escharotomy in circumferential full-thickness burns of limbs and thorax if there is any concern for ventilatory or distal vascular compromise that is not arising from another etiology (eg, hypoxemia or hypovolemia). Given the depth, these wounds are insensate; thus, escharotomy should not be delayed when clinically indicated.
Escharotomy of the limbs is performed by incising the eschar longitudinally on the mid-lateral aspect of the limb to the level of subcutaneous fat. Photo On the hands and feet, incisions should be on the dorsal surface. Extend the escharotomy the entire length of the burn and a few centimeters onto healthy skin. The incision should extend to the depth of healthy tissue below the burn. Escharotomy of the thorax is performed in bilateral mid-axillary lines from the 2nd to the 12th rib and connected with a transverse incision. Photo Escharotomy often results in non-life-threatening venous bleeding. Consult a burn specialist by phone if needed.
Normal capillary refill and oxygen saturation on the affected limb each have high negative predictive values for ruling out compartment syndrome from burns. However, the volume of crystalloid required in the resuscitation of large burns can increase the risk of developing compartment syndrome.",Thermal Burns
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Immediate assessment of the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation is critical to evaluate for signs of angioedema or evolving anaphylaxis, which may be life-threatening.
A rapid clinical history should be obtained to assess whether a patient is experiencing shortness of breath:
Chest tightness
Voice changes
Throat tightness
Lightheadedness
Abdominal pain
Nausea, vomiting, or any signs or symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis.
Patients with angioedema or anaphylaxis should receive epinephrine immediately
Epinephrine (1:1000) 0.01 mg/kg IM to the anterolateral aspect of the middle third of the thigh. Repeat every 5 - 15 minutes as needed up to 3 doses.
Maximum dose per injection is 0.5 mg in adults and 0.3 mg in children.
Auto-injectors typically contain 0.3 mg (adult) and 0.15 mg (child) of epinephrine in a 1:1000 solution. This is the safest administration method.
If extreme circumstance and low resource setting consider “bedside epinephrine drip”
AKA “dirty” epinephrine drip, one that the clinician prepares at the bedside by diluting an epinephrine preparation with saline, makes more precise delivery possible due to the greater volume of solution. This advantage, however, should be weighed against the risks of an error in preparation.
1 ampule of code-cart epinephrine (1:1000 or 1:10,000, both contain 1 mg of epinephrine total)
Inject full ampule into 1 litre of saline
Produces a 1 mcg/ml concentration of epinephrine
Titrate to effect
Note an 18 gauge IV wide open without pressure will deliver about 20-30 mcg/min (20-30 mls/min) (2)
Generally start at 5mcg/min (5 mls per minute) and titrate as required
Key Concepts
Review of pediatric urticaria EM:RAP 2016 EM:RAP Audio
Urticaria, also commonly referred to as hives or wheals, is defined by erythematous, pruritic, elevated skin lesions that typically last from 30 min to 24 h.
Lesions vary in both size and shape but are not normally painful and should not leave residual markings on the skin.
Pruritus with hives can be debilitating, and symptoms are frequently worse at night.
Urticaria is a common disorder, affecting approximately 20% of the general population at some point during life.
Urticaria is classified as acute (<6-wk duration) or chronic (>6-wk duration).
A large percentage of patients with urticaria will have associated angioedema.
Differential diagnosis should include contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and consideration of systemic illness.
Treatment in the ED includes avoidance of the allergen, when one can be identified, and antihistamines.
Refractory urticaria may benefit from an increased dose of antihistamines or a short course of steroids.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation: A young adult female presents with itching and acute onset of circumscribed, erythematous, raised skin lesions. She cannot identify any triggers for her symptoms and notices the development of new scattered lesions on her arms and neck during her time in the ED.
History should focus on identifying possible triggers or prior similar episodes. Clinicians should inquire about any foods, activities, exposures (insect bites), or other recent ingestions. A review of the patient’s current medications is also important.
If hives are described as painful, last longer than 24 h, or leave residual bruising/marks on the skin, consider urticarial vasculitis.
No lab tests, cultures, or diagnostic images are typically needed for the diagnosis of urticaria.
Limited diagnostics may be reasonable in the patient who presents with chronic urticaria or with new-onset urticaria for whom the clinical exam and history suggests a systemic disorder; these include CBC, metabolic panel, UA, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 
If high suspicion exists for a particular allergy, referral to an allergist or immunologist is appropriate to perform outpatient testing for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Interpretation of allergy tests requires expertise because a positive test is not necessarily diagnostic of an allergy and a negative test does not exclude its presence. Additionally, an allergist can perform a skin test if a food hypersensitivity is suspected.
Treatment
First-line therapy for new-onset urticaria should be aimed at reducing itching and histamine release with second-generation H1 antihistamine agents.

Second-line agents are first-generation H1 antihistamines; they may induce sedation and anticholinergic side effects that may be dose-limiting. 
Diphenhydramine: 25 - 50 mg IV/IM/PO q4-6h PRN
Pediatric dose: 0.5 - 1.25 mg/kg (max 50 mg per dose) IV/IM/PO q6h
Hydroxyzine: 25 - 50 mg PO q6h prn
Pediatric dose: 0.5 mg/kg q12h prn (max 50 mg per day <6 y and max 100 mg per day >6 y).
Patients with angioedema or anaphylaxis should receive epinephrine immediately
Epinephrine (1:1000) 0.01 mg/kg IM to the anterolateral aspect of the middle third of the thigh. Repeat every 5 - 15 minutes as needed up to 3 doses.
Maximum dose per injection is 0.5 mg in adults and 0.3 mg in children.

Prednisolone 0.5 - 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) PO q24h, tapering over 5-7 d for children.
Disposition
Without associated angioedema or systemic allergic reaction, patients presenting with hives can be discharged from the ED with outpatient follow-up and strict return instructions.
For chronic urticaria, referrals to an allergist should be considered.",Urticaria
"Deep Dive
Epidemiology
Urticaria occurs in approximately 20% of individuals at some point in life. 
It is an extremely common reason for seeking care, representing 11%-35% of dermatologic conditions presenting to the ED. 
Acute urticaria is more commonly found in children than adults. 
Urticaria seems to afflict females more frequently. 
Approximately 1% of the population is affected by chronic urticaria. 
The most common etiologies for acute urticaria are
Medications: Penicillins, vancomycin, anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids
Foods: Milk, eggs, nuts, fruits, soy, shellfish
Insects: Hymenoptera, bedbugs, fleas, mites
Radiocontrast media
Chronic urticaria may occur with cold or sunlight exposure.
Pathophysiology
Histologically, urticaria is a mast cell-driven process in the superficial dermis.
Mast cells, a type of granulocyte, reside mostly in connective tissue around blood vessels.
When stimulated by IgE (type I hypersensitivity) or through other pathways (pseudoallergic), mast cells degranulate and release histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and other inflammatory cytokines. 
The release of these chemical mediators causes transient vasodilation and leakage of plasma into the tissue and stimulates sensory nerve endings, resulting in redness, swelling, and pruritus. 
When this inflammatory process and swelling occur in the subcutis (deepest layer of the skin) or submucosal layers, it is referred to as angioedema.
As opposed to other types of edema, angioedema is usually not present in the dependent regions of the body. 
Angioedema co-occurs with urticaria in approximately 50% of cases. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Urticaria is classified as acute or chronic based on the duration of symptoms.
Acute urticaria is defined by the presence of hives with or without angioedema for <6 wk.
Chronic urticaria presents as continuous or intermittent wheals with or without angioedema for >6 wk. 
Chronic inducible urticaria: Lesions that appear from a consistent stimulus.
Chronic spontaneous urticaria: Symptoms that present without any discernible cause or stimulus.
There is no difference in appearance between the skin lesions of acute and chronic urticaria. 
Transient (<24 h), raised, itchy lesions are characteristic of hives. They may be circular, serpiginous, or irregular in shape. 
Urticaria is a clinical diagnosis; a careful history and physical examination is often all that is needed. If lesions are no longer present, asking to see photographs is often helpful. 
Historical considerations
Characterization of lesion appearance.
Duration of symptoms.
Presence of symptoms in the past.
New medications, foods, exposures, and travel history since onset.
Urticaria arising from an allergic response often arises within minutes to 2 h of the exposure.
Associated symptoms concerning for anaphylaxis (ie, 2 or more organ systems involved in addition to the skin).
Medications taken at home for the relief of symptoms before ED evaluation.
Determine dose received because patients often under-dose antihistamines.
The common causes of acute urticaria include 
Medications: Penicillins, vancomycin, anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids.
Foods: Milk, eggs, nuts, fruits, soy, shellfish.
Insects: Hymenoptera, bedbugs, fleas, mites.
Radiocontrast media.
Infections: Viral (human immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis), bacterial (urinary tract infections), or parasitic infection, particularly in children.
Most cases of acute urticaria are classified as “acute spontaneous urticaria” or idiopathic because the cause is ultimately never found. 
The association of bacterial or viral infections with acute urticaria is especially strong in children. 
Children with mycoplasma infection may develop urticaria that resolves with azithromycin but not antihistamines.
Parasitic infections can also cause acute urticaria symptoms. 
Acute physical or induced urticaria can be caused by firm stroking of the skin (symptomatic dermographism), hot or cold objects contacting the skin (cold or heat urticaria), or even physical exertion (exercise-induced urticaria). 
Rashes that can resemble urticaria and should be included in differential diagnoses
Fixed drug eruptions: Morbilliform lesions that coalesce over time and last for days.
Erythema multiforme: Target-shaped macular lesions that last for days.
Atopic dermatitis: Pruritic lesions that tend to be papules and plaques with scales, not wheals.
Contact dermatitis: Lesions that tend to be papules or vesicles only at the site of exposure.
In rare cases, urticaria is an early feature of a systemic disorder: 
Systemic mastocytosis: Recurring episodes that appear similar to anaphylaxis with flushing, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.
Urticarial vasculitis: Painful wheals that may evolve to purpura and can last >24 h; patient may also have fever and polyarthritis. 
Serum sickness: Fever and polyarthritis; can occur within several weeks of medication exposure.
Autoimmune disorder.
Malignancy.
In general, systemic diseases causing urticaria will result in recurrent, persistent, or refractory symptoms, and patients will often present with chronic urticaria symptoms at the time of diagnosis. 
If a true allergic reaction is considered the etiology of acute urticaria, a clear temporal relationship should exist between the exposure and onset of symptoms (often within minutes). 
Therapeutic Considerations
Any specific triggers identified for urticaria should be avoided by the patient whenever possible.
Avoidance of anti-inflammatory drugs is recommended because they can trigger urticaria or angioedema through non-immunologic mechanisms.
Referral for allergy testing might be useful if there is suspicion for a particular food or medication allergy. 
Given the association between parasitic infection and urticaria,  it may be reasonable to test the stool of those who have travelled to endemic areas or those with profound eosinophilia. 
Pharmacologic treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms caused by histamine release.
Second-generation antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, loratadine) are the first-line treatment for hives. These drugs are safe and effective without the sedating and anticholinergic effects of older antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. 
There are no randomized controlled trials comparing different antihistamines for urticaria.
These agents are only available in oral formulations, delaying their onset of action; therefore, they should not be the primary antihistamine used for anaphylaxis or angioedema.
H2 blockers (eg, ranitidine, famotidine) may reduce the time to resolution of urticaria when given together with H1 blockers.  Consider administering H2 blockers when symptoms are severe or do not resolve with H1 blockers.
A recent study in ED patients showed no improvement in symptom relief for patients who received an antihistamine, levocetirizine, and prednisone compared with antihistamine alone. 
Antihistamines typically result in rapid resolution of pruritus and lesions. A minority of patients may have persistent lesions despite an improvement in symptoms.
In patients with urticaria that is refractory to antihistamines, a short course (<1 wk) of higher-dose antihistamines and oral prednisone has been shown to induce remission. 
Patients with angioedema or concern for an allergic etiology of urticaria should receive a prescription for an epipen on discharge.",Urticaria
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient:
The approach to acid-base physiology in the ED should focus on determining the underlying cause of abnormalities and intervening when appropriate.
Treatment intended to correct laboratory values alone (ie, serum pH) is not helpful and at times can be detrimental.
Key Concepts
Exceptional video lecture on acid base disorders on EM:RAP HD EM:RAP Video
Serum pH alone neither defines a specific disease nor specifies an appropriate therapy. Instead, the underlying cause of the abnormality must be assessed, with the results of the assessment providing the key to resuscitation.
A patient’s acid-base status, whether respiratory or metabolic, can only be evaluated within that patient’s clinical context. For example, a patient suffering from chronic hypercapnia requires no active intervention. 
As such, blood gas analysis rarely affects patient management in the hyperacute setting.
Hyperchloremic (non-gap) acidosis is seldom imminently life threatening. Although hyperchloremic acidosis plays a role in the patient’s overall acid-base status, it does not require early screening.
Respiratory acid-base disturbances that require acute interventions are readily apparent. In such cases, the underlying cause of the respiratory compromise must be corrected.
Almost all acid-base emergencies that require early diagnostic inquiry are in the form of anion gap (AG) acidosis. All elevated AG, independent of the patient’s serum bicarbonate or pH, should be carefully examined.  
Key Diagnostic Elements
The accuracy of historical and physical exam findings is insufficient for the independent identification of acid-base disorders. 
Because a patient’s precise pH is, in itself, minimally significant, clinicians should instead use the patient’s history and physical exam to elucidate the etiology of the patient’s presentation.
Labs and imaging:
Arterial vs. venous blood gas (ABG or VBG) analysis: In most cases, a VBG analysis serves as an adequate surrogate for an ABG.
As acidosis becomes increasingly severe, values of the ABG and VBG diverge.
Because the precise pH is minimally significant, the difference between ABG and VBG rarely has a clinical consequence. 
Blood chemistry:
The most notable items are Na+, K+, Cl−, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and albumin.
Serum lactate. 
Ketones, either urine or serum.
Salicylate level.
Pregnancy test.
Echo, FAST, and/or CT if and when clinically indicated to help further elucidate the underlying cause.
Treatment
The most important therapy when treating disturbances in acid-base physiology is to identify and treat the underlying cause.
Balanced vs. hyperchloremic fluids:
Many investigations have studied the use of balanced vs. hyperchloremic IV fluids, most notably normal saline (NS). In this case, the concern is that the chloride content of NS is supraphysiologic, which can lead to an elevated serum chloride level and thus a hyperchloremic acidosis. Some early data suggest that elevated serum chloride levels can lead to an increase in the incidence of acute kidney injury, the need for dialysis, and renal failure. Despite these concerns, multiple large randomized controlled trials have failed to identify a consistent signal of harm. Fluid choices are discussed in more detail in the “Deep Dive” section; otherwise, it is most important to note that the initial fluid selection during treatment in the ED likely has little effect on a patient’s important outcomes. The quantity of fluid is likely far more important than the type administered.   
Sodium bicarbonate infusions:
No trial has identified a mortality benefit when sodium bicarbonate is used in either bolus or infusion form to correct a patient’s serum pH. 
In a recent randomized controlled trial by Jaber et al., providing an infusion of 4.2% sodium bicarbonate to ICU patients presenting with metabolic acidosis and a pH <7.20 did not improve mortality. The authors noted small improvements in secondary outcomes, but these improvements should only serve toward future hypothesis generation and not clinical application. 
Disposition
Each patient’s eventual disposition depends on the underlying cause of the acid-base disequilibrium. For example, a patient presenting with acidosis due to alcoholic ketoacidosis or renal insufficiency can often be discharged from the ED following appropriate therapy. Conversely, a patient with only a mild acidosis secondary to sepsis often requires admission to the hospital and likely to the ICU.",Acid-Base Disorders
"Deep Dive
The Meaning of Acid-Base
Serum pH is a measurement of the activity of free protons in the plasma.
pH = −log10[H+]
A pH value of 7.4 corresponds to a H+ concentration of 39.8  nmol/L.
Clinicians commonly find acid-base chemistry results confusing, because they are asked to find clinical meaning in a negative algorithmic equation of the serum concentration of hydrogen ions.
The actual pH or concentration of H+ matters far less than the underlying cause of the acid-base abnormality. Any acid-base schema should endeavor to identify the causative factors relating to the acid-base perturbations and then strive to correct these rather than to directly correct the pH.
It is important to differentiate acidemia from acidosis, and alkalemia from alkalosis.
Acidemia and alkalemia are direct measures of the serum H+ concentration. When the pH is <7.35, an acidemia is present. When the pH is >7.45, an alkalemia is present.
Acidosis is any process that leads to an increase in serum acidity. A patient can have multiple acidoses or alkaloses that, in sum, give rise to the serum pH.
Alkalosis is any process that leads to an increase in serum alkalinity. A patient can have multiple acidoses or alkaloses that, in sum, give rise to the serum pH.
It is a commonly held belief that acidemia negatively affects a patient’s cardiac function and response to vasopressor agents. This dogma is based on animal models that have never been validated in human studies. In contrast, a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that correcting the serum pH without intervening with regard to the underlying problem does not correct the hemodynamic dysfunction. Instead, it is likely that the cause of the cardiac dysfunction and vasopressor resistance in the animal model studies was actually the underlying disease leading to the acidosis in question.
A significant body of evidence suggests that acidosis in itself causes only minimal physiologic unrest. Frumin demonstrated patients’ ability to tolerate acidosis from hypercapnia to extremely low levels (pH as low as 6.8) without any signs of physiologic distress or hemodynamic compromise. For example, shortly after a race, Olympic rowers have exhibited serum pH values as low as 6.8 without any ill effects. Patients presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with impressively severe acidosis rarely demonstrate hemodynamic compromise. In contrast, the septic patient with lactic acidosis and a pH of 7.1 is often in refractory shock and dying.  Multiple studies have demonstrated that the prognosis of patients with acidosis is not related to serum pH but rather to the underlying cause of the acid-base abnormality. 
H+ and HCO3− are dependent variables and are determined by the independent determinants of acid-base chemistry in the body. The pH of the body is determined by 3 components:1
Strong ions (eg, Na+, Cl−, lactate)
Strong ions completely dissociate in water and do not remain in their molecular forms (ie, NaCl is not in solution as molecules of NaCl, but rather as ions of Na+ and Cl−).
Weak acids (albumin, phosphate)
Weak acids only partially dissociate in water.
CO2
CO2 is a respiratory determinant of acid-base status.
Acidosis and alkalosis are used to define the type of physiological processes that are occurring within the patient. Attempts to determine whether these are primary or secondary processes will not be emphasized in this chapter, because they tend to be neither clinically helpful nor accurate.
For example, a patient presents with a metabolic acidosis secondary to DKA. Blood gas analysis reveals that he also has a decreased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). The traditional approach would state that this is a compensatory process secondary to the DKA. The traditional approach would then require clinicians to determine whether the patient is appropriately compensating using Winter’s Formula. Typically, such processes are cumbersome, confusing, and, more importantly, inaccurate, and do not aid clinical decision-making. Clinicians do not intubate a patient secondary to the results of the Winter’s Formula but rather based on the patient’s actual appearance.
In our diagnostic schema, it would be determined that the patient has a metabolic acidosis due to DKA and a respiratory alkalosis. The clinician would then determine whether the patient is appropriately compensating for the increased CO2 secondary to the metabolic acidosis based on clinical judgment.
Respiratory Acid-Base Physiology
CO2, while not an acid itself, functions as one through the formation of carbonic acid:
CO2 + H2O ⇄ H2CO3 ⇄ H+ + HCO3−
The human body produces approximately 290-360  L of CO2 per day as a waste product. CO2 is eliminated via the lungs by ventilation.
The pH and pCO2 in a blood test describe the patient’s ability to handle their metabolic load or CO2 production.
The body tightly regulates CO2 hemostasis by modifying respiratory drive and minute ventilation to closely maintain pCO2 hemostasis.2
It is important to know a patient’s pCO2 to aid in our understanding of his/her current respiratory function and how the patient is handling his/her metabolic demand.
The typical assumption is that the pCO2 will guide therapy (eg, intubation or non-invasive ventilation [NIV]).
However, this assumption is not always valid. Studies have failed to determine an association between pH and/or pCO2 and the patient’s need for NIV or intubation, or the patient’s mortality.
Hence, it is important to place the patient’s pCO2 in its proper clinical context, and medical decisions should not be made based on this value alone.
In the traditional acid-base teachings, there is a focus on using the blood gas to determine whether the respiratory dysfunction (hyper- or hypocarbia) is a primary disorder or a compensatory mechanism. This approach is complex and unreliable. A simpler method is proposed here:
If pCO2 is elevated, then a respiratory acidosis is present.
If pCO2 is low, then a respiratory alkalosis is present.
Use the clinical context to determine whether this imbalance of CO2 production vs. elimination is a primary or secondary problem.
The traditional acid-base teachings also heavily emphasize determining whether there is appropriate respiratory compensation for a metabolic acidosis by using Winter’s Formula.
Winter’s Formula was derived from a cohort of stable patients with DKA; it has not been validated across the spectrum of acid-base abnormalities.
In traditional teachings, it is assumed that if the patient is not appropriately compensating via Winter’s Formula, then the clinician should intervene (ie, intubation, NIV, high-flow nasal cannula).
However, according to modern clinical practice, these interventions should be considered clinical decisions that the physician determines by assessing the patient’s work of breathing, mental status, and so on. Calculating the patient’s Winter’s Formula is unnecessary and potentially misleading.
Respiratory alkalosis:
Respiratory alkalosis represents a state in which ventilation outpaces CO2 production. This state typically occurs when an alternative process is driving the patient’s respiratory rate. For example:
Metabolic acidosis.
Disease processes that lead to a hypoxic respiratory drive, increasing the patient’s ventilation with no increase in CO2 production.
Anxiety attack.
Typically, respiratory alkalosis is associated with noticeable tachypnea, and it is the clinician’s responsibility to identify the underlying cause of this increased respiratory rate rather than directly trying to decrease the minute ventilation or balance the pH.
Respiratory acidosis:
As described previously, the body tightly regulates CO2 hemostasis. Most cases of respiratory acidosis fall into one of two categories:
“Won’t breathe”
Respiratory mechanics are intact but the patient has lost his/her central drive to maintain CO2 hemostasis.
Patients presenting with an opioid overdose are the classic example of “won’t breathe.” A key component of the opioid toxidrome is suppression of the central respiratory drive. Patients no longer respond appropriately to an increasing pCO2.
“Can’t breathe”
Central respiratory drive is intact but the patient’s work of breathing has outpaced the patient’s ability to maintain CO2 hemostasis.
These cases can be divided into:
Increased CO2 production (eg, DKA, salicylate intoxication, sepsis).
Increased work of breathing (eg, asthma, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome).
A decrease in the patient’s ability to manage the respiratory workload (eg, neuromuscular disorders, muscular atrophy).  
Metabolic Acid-Base Physiology
Law of conservation of electroneutrality:
All positive charges must equal all negative charges. This is the principle of electrical neutrality.   
The determinants of acid-base status are the differences in strong anions, weak anions, and pCO2.
Cations: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ (for practical purposes, use only the Na value because this is the major cation present in the serum).
Anions: Cl−, HCO3−, and the remainder, which is typically referred to as the AG.
A normal AG is filled by albumin, inorganic phosphate, sulfate, and lactate.
Metabolic acidosis occurs in one of two ways:
An increase in the chloride anion in relation to the sodium cation.
Bicarbonate then decreases in response to the increase in chloride.
An increase in the “unmeasured anions” (AG) in relation to sodium.
Bicarbonate then decreases in response to the increase in these anions.
Metabolic alkalosis occurs in one of two ways:
A decrease in the chloride anion in relation to the sodium cation.
Bicarbonate then increases in response to the decrease in chloride.
A decrease in the “unmeasured anions” in relation to sodium.
Bicarbonate will increase in response to the decrease in these anions.
This process requires a method for quantifying the amount of chloride and the amount of unmeasured anions in the system in relation to sodium.
Strong ion difference (SID): Quantifies the role of chloride with respect to a patient’s acid-base status. Figure
Although the full computation of SID involves a variety of complex formulas with inexact, and often insignificant, contributions from Ca2+, Mg2+, phosphate, sulfate, and lactate;3 nonetheless a simplified approach that focuses only on these main elements significantly decreases the time and complexity of these calculations.
A simplified SID equation is restricted only to Na-Cl, with a normal SID being 38 ± 2.
Elevated SID Figure:
An elevated SID (>40) represents a greater amount of Na+ (or positive charges) relative to Cl− (negative charges). This constitutes a case of SID alkalosis.  
The causes include
Vomiting: Loss of HCl (free Cl−).
Dehydration: Reabsorption of NaHCO3 (free Na+) at the kidney.
Sodium bicarbonate administration: Increases Na+ in relation to Cl−.
Low SID Figure:
A decreased SID (<36) indicates more Cl− relative to Na+. This constitutes a case of SID acidosis.
The causes include
Diarrhea: Loss of NaHCO3 (free Na+) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
Acute kidney injury: Loss of NaHCO3 in the kidneys.
Renal tubular acidosis: There are various types of renal tubular acidosis (1, 2, and 4) that are beyond the scope of this guide, but all cause a relative loss of NaHCO3.
Normal saline (NS) administration: Resuscitative fluids have various concentrations of Na+ and Cl−. A fluid’s relative concentrations of Na+ and Cl− or its SID directly influences the patient’s baseline SID and thus his/her acid-base status.
NS has an SID of 0 (zero). Multiple studies have demonstrated that administration of NS is associated with the development of a hyperchloremic (SID) acidosis
Lactated Ringer’s and Plasmalyte have SID values of 25 and 42, respectively.
Such examples tend to have a neutral, or even an alkalizing, effect on serum pH.
AG = [Na+] − ([Cl−] + [HCO3−]), which quantifies the role of other unmeasured anions with respect to a patient’s acid-base status. Figure
Low AG value: Alkalosis Figure
Typically due to a decrease in albumin.
Often seen in patients with chronic malnutrition.
Also seen in processes with unmeasured cations (eg, lithium ingestion or multiple myeloma).
High AG value Figure
AG values greater than normal will be filled by an unmeasured anion. Most of these cases are due to a serious underlying pathology. Clinicians should seek to identify all of the anions that fill the gap as well as the underlying cause of the elevated AG value.
“MUDPILES” for assessing metabolic acidosis:
Methanol:
Anion: Formate.
Formate is a retinal toxin and neurotoxin.  
The patient may have a concomitant lactic acidosis and/or ketoacidosis as well, and potentially an SID alkalosis. 
Methanol is responsible for the Osm gap (OG), while its anion metabolite, formate, is responsible for the AG.  
Therefore, the effect on serum osmolarity is greatest early following ingestion, at which point the AG might be less elevated. Then, over time, as methanol is metabolized to formate, the OG decreases and the AG increases. 
Common sources of methanol: Windshield wiper fluid, gas line antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, copy machine fluid, perfumes, food warming fuel, and other types of fuels.
Uremia:
Predominantly related to several unmeasured strong ions (that are not incorporated into the normal AG calculation), including phosphatase, sulfates, and Krebs cycle derivatives.4
The BUN level does not directly correlate with an increase in the AG but instead serves to notify the clinician that renal failure may play a role in an elevated AG acidosis.
Typically, AG acidosis due to renal failure is mild. Clinicians should be hesitant to attribute large AGs to renal failure alone.
DKA ketones: Although the D stands for diabetic, DKA is not the only source of ketoacidosis encountered in the ED.
DKA
Anion: The ketones acetoacetate and 3-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (3BH) are the two major electrochemically active ketones. 
Acetoacetate exists in equilibrium with 3BH based on the NADH/NAD ratio Algorithm. Acetone is spontaneously generated from acetoacetate by spontaneous decarboxylation. Acetone does not contribute to the acid-base status of the body. 3BH can be measured quantitatively via a serum 3BH assay. Both acetoacetate and acetone are measured qualitatively using the urine ketone assay. The ratio of 3BH to acetoacetate is known as the ketone body ratio (KBR). The KBR is normally 1:1 but increases in pathological states: DKA will have a 3BH level >3, and alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) can have a KBR as high as 19.  
Depending on the KBR value, the urine ketone assay may be poorly sensitive to the detection of ketones in the 3BH form.
AKA is the second most common cause of ketoacidosis.
The increased redox state (increase in the NADH/NAD ratio) leads to an elevated KBR,  in which:
Urine ketones may be negative, because the majority of ketones are in the form 3BH.
The clinical picture is generally a chronic alcoholic with recent episodes of emesis and decreased oral intake, resulting in ketogenesis. Major complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status are typical.
Labs reveal an elevated AG, but the patient may have a mixed acid-base disorder secondary to an SID acidosis due to emesis.
Elevated lactates may also exist in this state as a result of the high NADH/NAD status of the liver, while peripherally the lactate can be converted for use as glucose.
Mortality is very low, at a rate of <1%.
Pregnancy: Ketoacidosis of pregnancy occurs fairly quickly even after a short duration of decreased oral intake, generally in the third trimester. 
Pregnancy ketoacidosis is different from ketosis in the setting of hyperemesis gravidarum, which is more common earlier in pregnancy. 
Starvation: Starvation ketosis can be the cause of severe ketoacidosis. 
Phenformin:
Phenformin is no longer available in the U.S. due to its risk of lactic acidosis; however, metformin is available. Phenformin carries a significantly higher risk of lactic acidosis than metformin. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurs when metformin levels exceed 5 mg/mL. The risk factors include poor renal or hepatic function, dehydration, or increased synthesis of lactate. Metformin causes both increased production of lactate and impaired lactate metabolism. Elevated metformin and lactate levels, as well as decreased pH, are associated with increased mortality. 
Isonicotinylhydrazide or isoniazid (INH)/Iron:
Iron:
Anion: Lactate.
A significant portion of the acidosis that occurs in iron toxicity is a result of the conversion of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+). Conversion interferes with the Krebs cycle, causing a mild elevation in citric and lactic acids. The resulting change in pH occurs fairly quickly after ingestion.  Hemodynamic instability leads to lactic acidosis.
Iron overdose typically presents with 5 stages:
I - GI symptoms;
II - Latent period;
III - Hemodynamic instability with frank acidosis (both direct and lactic acidosis), cardiomyopathy, coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation;
IV - Iron-induced liver injury; and  
V - Structural GI abnormalities in the weeks that follow. 
Toxic doses are typically within the range of 20-60 mg/kg, which is when severe toxicity is thought to occur.
Serum iron levels <300 mg/dL are typically considered non-toxic, whereas levels >500 mg/dL are considered toxic. Peak serum iron concentrations occur between 4 and 6 h after ingestion.  After this time, serum iron levels start to decrease. During this time frame, iron levels can be misleading and should not be used in isolation.
INH - Binds pyridoxine, depleting γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) stores and leading to seizures. Seizures result in lactic acidosis. The treatment is pyridoxine in equal amounts to the ingested INH. Seizures generally result from doses >30 mg/kg. In significant ingestion initial symptoms often occur within the first 30 min and are non-specific. Over time, more neurological symptoms develop, including seizures and, eventually, coma. Seizures are refractory to traditional seizure treatments. 
If patients are not seizing, it is unlikely that the AG is due to an ingestion of INH.
Similar toxicities can be observed with other hydrazides, most notably monomethylhydrazine found in the Gyromitra mushroom.  
Lactate
Anion: Lactate.
Hyperlactemia can be divided into two types: Type A (tissue hypoxia) vs. Type B (non-tissue hypoxia). 
In the setting of asthma, case reports show that albuterol use can increase serum lactate levels to nearly 10-fold the normal value. 
While it was originally believed that lactate elevations observed in sepsis were due to tissue hypoxia, recent evidence suggests that the majority of lactate seen in sepsis is due to increased sympathetic tone and that, in fact, lactate may serve as an important substrate for cardiac myocytes and the brain. 
The AG is an insufficient screening tool for elevated lactate levels. A significant number (40%-70%) of elevated lactate levels are not identified when using an AG of 12-16 mEq/L. 
While lactate testing is often considered a screening test for sepsis, elevated levels can be observed in many presentations. Serum lactate should be considered a prognostic test, informing the clinician as to the severity of illness, rather than identifying the existence of any specific pathology. 
Ethylene glycol:
Anion: Two toxic metabolites.
Glycolate: Causes a metabolic acidosis and may lead to the production of lactate.
Oxalate: Forms calcium oxalate crystals, which can precipitate and cause acute renal failure, as well as cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological end-organ dysfunction, and can result in hypocalcemia.
The “classic progression” of signs and symptoms includes neurological signs and symptoms, then cardiac dysfunction, followed by renal failure.  
Similar to methanol, ethylene glycol is the active osmole, causing early elevation of OG; later, as the parent compound is metabolized to glycolate and oxalate, an AG acidosis occurs.
Calcium oxalate crystals develop in the urine at 4-5 h after ingestion.
Observation of calcium oxalate crystal is neither sensitive nor specific.
Sources: The most common source of ethylene glycol is antifreeze. 
Diethylene glycol: Brake fluid, which yields the same metabolites, may cause pancreatic and liver injury.
Salicylates
Anion: Mixed lactate and ketones.
Salicylate toxicity causes acid-base disturbances by two main mechanisms:
Central stimulation of the respiratory centers resulting in respiratory alkalosis. 
Inhibition of the normal pathways of glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to ketoacidosis and aminoacidemia and resulting in a metabolic acidosis, as well as Na+ losses in the form of perspiration and renal losses.
Initially, patients are alkalotic. Acidosis typically occurs 12-24 h after ingestion.
Salicylate toxicity is one of the few presentations in which the serum pH matters. As acidosis worsens, salicylates more easily cross the blood–brain barrier, leading to an increase in cerebral edema. Serum pH should be monitored carefully when managing patients with salicylate ingestions. Clinicians should endeavor to maintain the pH in the alkalemic range. 
Diagnostic Work-Up
pH: Signifies whether any acidemia or alkalemia is present.
Clinicians should remember that the exact pH is minimally significant, and instead should endeavor to identify the underlying cause of the acid-base abnormality.
pCO2: Signifies the respiratory component of a patient’s acid-base status.
An elevated pCO2 indicates a respiratory acidosis.
A decreased pCO2 indicates a respiratory alkalosis.
SID: Quantifies the role of chloride in a patient’s acid-base status.
An elevated SID indicates a hypochloremic (SID) alkalosis.
A decreased SID indicates a hyperchloremic (SID) acidosis.
Gap: Quantifies the role of “unmeasured anions” in a patient’s acid-base status.
An elevated gap indicates a gap acidosis.
A decreased gap indicates a gap alkalosis.
When a gap acidosis is present, clinicians should seek to determine which anion is causing the increase in the anion gap.
Labs: Lactate, ketones, BUN, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) levels.
The level of elevation in lactate or 3BH should approximate the elevation in AG.
Elevations in BUN do not correspond with elevations in AG and serve as a surrogate for the unmeasured anions associated with renal failure.
If all of these labs are negative and the patient continues to have a persistent AG, both methanol and ethylene glycol should be entertained as potential diagnoses.
Often the use of the OG is discussed to differentiate toxic alcohol ingestion from other causes of AG acidosis.
It is important to note that the OG is neither a sensitive nor specific test for identifying the presence of a toxic alcohol. ",Acid-Base Disorders
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Adrenal Crisis
Establish IV access and draw serum electrolytes and glucose.
Consider sending cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. Do not wait for results.
Administer IV fluid boluses of 1-3 L (normal saline or 5% dextrose in normal saline) for shock, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia; 50% dextrose (D50) may be used as needed for hypoglycemia.
Give vasopressors for refractory shock (eg, norepinephrine, dopamine, or phenylephrine).
Administer IV steroids; options include the following:
Dexamethasone 4 mg IV q12h for patients with no history of adrenal crisis because it does not interfere with subsequent cosyntropin (ACTH) testing.
Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q6h may otherwise be given to patients with a history of adrenal insufficiency (AI) or to severely unstable patients.
The patient should be closely monitored and may require admission to the ICU.
Pheochromocytoma
Establish IV access and send serum electrolytes and basic labs.
For patients with a known history or suspected diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, medications should begin with alpha blockade. Administer:
Phentolamine, a short-acting, non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker (eg, 2.5-5 mg IV bolus followed by 1 mg/min infusion).
Sodium nitroprusside, a vasodilator, can then be effectively used for blood pressure control at an infusion of 0.3-0.5 μg/kg/min, titrating to effect (max 10 μg/kg/min).
Nicardipine may also be used for hypertension at a rate of 5 mg/h titrated up by 2.5 mg/h q15min to a maximum of 15 mg/h.
Closely monitor blood pressure and admit the patient to the ICU.
Key Concepts
Adrenal Insufficiency
AI occurs when the physiologic demand for glucocorticoids (cortisol) and/or mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) exceeds the supply from the adrenal cortex.
Strongly consider adrenal crisis if a patient’s hypotension does not respond to fluid resuscitation and/or vasopressors or if their hypoglycemia does not respond to dextrose, especially if the patient has been on long-term steroids or has a known autoimmune disorder, classic electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), human immunodeficiency (HIV), tuberculosis, or head trauma.
Adrenal crisis is a life-threatening emergency, and treatment should not be delayed for any testing. A sepsis work-up should be initiated to assess for precipitating factors.
A random serum cortisol and ACTH level may be sent. If the patient is stable, consider performing a cosyntropin test.
Treatment is steroid replacement. Hydrocortisone is the first-line treatment because of its glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects, but it will affect the results of a cosyntropin test. Dexamethasone is an alternative that does not interfere with subsequent cosyntropin testing.
To address hypoglycemia and hyponatremia, 5% dextrose in normal saline is the fluid of choice.
Pheochromocytoma
Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla that may precipitate life-threatening hypertension and multi-organ system failure.
Clinical presentations are variable because patients present with intermittent symptoms that can randomly occur for variable periods of time.
Confirmatory laboratory testing is often not available in the ED; the diagnosis is largely based on clinical suspicion.
The critical patient who presents to the ED with fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and altered mental status with evidence of multi-organ failure is in pheochromocytoma multi-system crisis, which has a mortality close to 85%.
Adrenalectomy is the definitive management. Emergency preoperative treatment is the alpha blocker phentolamine (eg, 2.5-5 mg IV bolus followed by 1 mg/min infusion). Alpha blockade should be given first to avoid paradoxical hypertension, followed by beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or sodium nitroprusside as needed for resistant hypertension.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Adrenal Insufficiency
Textbook presentation: A 30-y-old female presents to the ED lethargic with a history of weight loss, salt craving, and hyperpigmentation. She arrives febrile and hypotensive and complains of abdominal and chest pain. Resuscitation with IV fluids and vasopressors does not improve her blood pressure.
In adrenal crisis, the presentation can be non-specific. The most common symptoms are hypotension/shock (90%), abdominal/flank/back/lower chest pain (86%), and fever (66%). 
The most frequent signs and symptoms of primary AI (PAI) include hyperpigmentation and constitutional symptoms such as weakness or fatigue (84%-100%), anorexia (100%), weight loss (25%-100%), nausea (25%-86%), vomiting (25%-75%), abdominal pain (49%-62%), and salt craving (16%-64%). 
If adrenal crisis is suspected, treatment should not be delayed for any testing. If the patient is stable, random serum cortisol levels may be performed. In a patient with severe sepsis/shock, a serum cortisol level >20 μg/dL argues against adrenal crisis but is not definitive because patients have variable cortisol levels throughout the day.  Cosyntropin stimulation testing is more suggestive of the diagnosis.
Other labs that may be helpful include serum chemistries (for sodium and potassium), ACTH, aldosterone, renin (ideally measured before steroids are administered), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine levels, coagulation factors, and work-up for potential triggers (eg, infection, myocardial infarction, trauma, substance withdrawal).
Pheochromocytoma
Textbook presentation: A 45-y-old man presents to the ED with a history of recurrent episodes of heart palpitations, sweating, and headache over the past week. He states that when he measured his blood pressure at the local drug store, it was 225/115. He notes a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).
The most frequent symptoms include headache (82%), diaphoresis (60%), palpitations (48%), anxiety (35%), dizziness (18%), abdominal pain, flank pain, myalgias, and arthralgias. 
Clinical signs can be broad and may include weight loss, fever, paroxysmal hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, shock, diaphoresis, tachycardia, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, myocarditis, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, cerebrovascular accidents, intracranial hemorrhages, seizures, hemiplegia, tremors, paresthesias, melena, hematochezia, café au lait spots, neurofibromas, hematuria, pain, and pallor.
The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is confirmed by urinary and plasma fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines, but testing should occur after medications that increase measured levels of catecholamines and metanephrines are safely discontinued.
Biochemical testing should be followed by imaging with non-contrast CT or MRI to locate the tumor, which occurs in the abdomen or pelvis 95% of the time. 
Treatment
Adrenal Insufficiency
Do not wait for results before starting treatment. If the suspicion is high, treat the patient.
Resuscitate with IV isotonic crystalloids with dextrose and vasopressors as needed.
Correct hypoglycemia with dextrose.
Stress dose steroids.
Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV followed by either 100 mg q8h or 50 mg IV q6h.
If the patient is stable and/or has no prior diagnosis of AI, consider giving dexamethasone 4 mg IV q12h instead.
This will not interfere with any subsequent cosyntropin stimulation testing.
Maintain a low threshold for a broad work-up, as stressors (ie, sepsis, myocardial infarction) are usually the trigger for AI.
Pheochromocytoma
The goal is to control the blood pressure before surgery, which is the only curative measure.
Alpha blockade first.
Phentolamine acutely with dosing of 2.5-5 mg IV bolus followed by 1 mg/min infusion.
Phenoxybenzamine 10 mg PO q12h is long-term treatment. Dose is increased to control blood pressure over days.
Blood pressure control after alpha blockade.
Nicardipine 5 mg/h IV and titrate by 2.5 mg/h up to 15 mg/h or
Clevidipine 1-2 mg/h IV and titrate by doubling the dose up to 32 mg/h or
Sodium nitroprusside 0.3-0.5 μg/kg/min, titrating to effect (max 10 μg/kg/min)
Consult Surgery for adrenalectomy, which is the only cure.
Closely monitor blood pressure and admit the patient to the ICU.
Disposition
Adrenal Insufficiency
All adrenal crisis patients should be admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and serial labs.
Patients with a history of AI who present with mild physiologic stressors may very rarely be discharged from the ED once the illness is managed and stress dose steroids are begun. Endocrinology should be consulted in making this disposition.
Patients with insidious presentations of AI with no acute illness can be further evaluated and treated on an outpatient basis. Refer for close Endocrinology and Primary Care follow-up.
Pheochromocytoma
Patients who have pheochromocytoma with multi-organ systemic failure or who require IV infusions to control blood pressure and heart rate will require admission to the ICU.
Stable patients may be discharged home with oral medications during the preoperative period but require routine blood pressure monitoring.",Adrenal Emergencies

Background
Epidemiology
Adrenal Crisis
Among PAI patients, 8%-47% will have at least one adrenal crisis in their lives.  Adrenal crisis is more often precipitated by mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) deficiency, putting PAI patients who are uniquely deficient in mineralocorticoids at the highest risk of crisis. 
Among secondary AI (SAI) patients, 6%-35% will have at least one adrenal crisis in their lives. Risk factors for adrenal crisis in SAI patients include female gender and diabetes insipidus.
PAI
In the U.S., 40-60 cases of PAI (also known as Addison’s disease) occur per 1 million people. Outside the U.S., the prevalence is 4-144 cases per million. 
Risk factors include female gender and age 30-69 y.
The relative risk of overall mortality in those with PAI is twice that of those without PAI. 
SAI and Tertiary AI (TAI)
Although exact prevalence numbers are lacking, SAI and TAI are thought to be more common than PAI due to the number of patients on chronic steroid therapy. Roughly 2% of Americans are believed to have a relative AI that only manifests at times of stress. 
Pheochromocytoma
Catecholamine-secreting tumors (also known as pheochromocytomas) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that account for less than 0.2% of patients with hypertension. 
Pheochromocytomas occur in all races but are less commonly diagnosed in blacks. Peak incidence is in the third, fourth, and fifth decades of life.  The condition is equally common in men and women.
Annual prevalence is estimated to be between 1:2,500 and 1:6,500.  The true incidence of pheochromocytomas is difficult to determine because 10%-25% of patients are diagnosed incidentally by CT or MRI for unrelated symptoms and another 50% are diagnosed at autopsy. 
Classically, the diagnostic pattern is encapsulated by the “Rule of 10s.” A modified Rule of 10s reads as follows: Pheochromocytomas are malignant in 10% of cases; 10% are bilateral; roughly 10% occur in children; 10% are extra-adrenal (paragangliomas); 10%-25% are discovered incidentally; 10%-24% are familial.
Pheochromocytomas can also be inherited as part of an autosomal dominant familial syndrome, such as MEN2, neurofibromatosis type 1, and von Hippel-Lindau disease.
Pathophysiology
Overview of Adrenal Physiology
The adrenal gland is made up of 2 parts, the cortex and medulla. The medulla produces catecholamines, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The adrenal cortex consists of 3 zones: the zona glomerulosa produces the mineralocorticoid aldosterone; the zona fasciculata produces the glucocorticoid cortisol; and the zona reticularis produces androgens.
Cortisol normally facilitates the body’s response to stress (trauma, infection) by influencing the immune system, vascular tone, and metabolism. Cortisol is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In this pathway, the hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce ACTH. ACTH in turn stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol. Figure
Aldosterone normally maintains the body’s salt balance and blood pressure. In the setting of decreased blood flow to the kidney (as in hypovolemia), aldosterone causes the renal nephrons to conserve sodium and to secrete potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. 
Adrenal Crisis
Adrenal crisis is an acute life-threatening presentation of AI. It can be caused by an acute stressor in those with baseline AI (most common) or by sudden damage to the HPA axis. 
In adrenal crisis, the body’s supply of cortisol (PAI, SAI, TAI) and/or aldosterone (PAI) cannot meet the demand for these hormones elicited by the physiologic stressor.
Common triggers include fever (24% in PAI, 15% in SAI), gastrointestinal (GI) illness (33% in PAI, 22% in SAI), surgery (7% in PAI, 16% in SAI), and strenuous activity. 
Other causes include sudden withdrawal of chronic steroids, alcohol withdrawal, myocardial infarction, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage/infarction, pituitary apoplexy, labor, prematurity in neonates, and traumatic delivery in neonates. 
Adrenal crisis in neonates is most commonly due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Classic CAH is part of the newborn screen in all states. If missed on screening, adrenal crisis in these patients occurs at 10-20 d of life. 
PAI
In PAI, the immune system or another process directly involutes the adrenal cortex, leading to decreased cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens. At least 90% of the gland must be eradicated for PAI to occur. 
Autoimmune disorders cause 80% of adult PAI cases in the U.S. Autoimmune PAI can occur as an isolated disorder or as part of a syndrome (ie, polyglandular autoimmune syndrome types I and II). Around 50% of patients with autoimmune PAI have another type of autoimmune endocrine disorder as well.
Because glucocorticoid cortisol levels are low in PAI, the pituitary gland, as part of the HPA axis, secretes more ACTH to attempt to stimulate the adrenal to make more cortisol. As a result, there is a large amount of ACTH in the serum of patients with PAI. ACTH is a precursor in the production of melanin, producing the hyperpigmented skin seen in PAI individuals. This latter characteristic is unique to PAI.
Tuberculosis is the most common cause of PAI internationally but is involved in fewer than 10% of cases in developed countries. 
Other causes of PAI include adrenal hemorrhage or thrombosis, infections (eg, Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, cytomegalovirus, HIV), endocrinopathies, medications (etomidate, phenytoin, ketoconazole, fluconazole, megestrol acetate, suramin, aminoglutethimide, barbiturates, rifampin), infiltrative disorders (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, lymphoma, malignancy), surgery (bilateral adrenalectomy), and genetic disorders (CAH, peroxisomal disorders, familial glucocorticoid deficiency). 
The primary causes of PAI in pediatric patients include CAH (73%; incidence of 1 per 14,200 live births) and autoimmune etiology (15%).
SAI
SAI is failure of the pituitary gland to produce adequate ACTH. Low ACTH levels result in low levels of endogenous cortisol, leading to symptoms of SAI. Long-term adrenal atrophy can occur.
Of note, the other adrenal hormones (ie, aldosterone, androgen, and catecholamines) remain unaffected. 
Causes of SAI with select examples include abrupt withdrawal of prolonged glucocorticoid therapy (most common), tumors (primary brain tumors or local invasion of pituitary), trauma (head trauma, pituitary surgery, pituitary irradiation), pituitary necrosis/bleeding (Sheehan syndrome), medications (chronic high-dose progestins such as megestrol or medroxyprogesterone, opioids), infections (tuberculosis, meningitis, HIV, fungal), and infiltrative disorders (sarcoid, amyloidosis, hemosiderosis, malignancy, lymphoma, histiocytosis X). 
Chronic steroids suppress the HPA axis. Consequently, for those on chronic steroids, it usually takes around 4-6 wk (but can take up to 1 y) for the HPA axis to return to its normal function after the cessation of steroid use. Notably, inhaled, topical, or rectal steroid dosing routes do not normally inhibit the HPA axis but have occasionally been found to do so. 
TAI
TAI is failure of the hypothalamus to produce adequate CRH. Without CRH, there is no ACTH or cortisol, resulting in long-term adrenal atrophy.
As with SAI, the other adrenal hormones (ie, aldosterone, androgen, and catecholamines) remain unaffected. 
The most common cause is prolonged high-dose steroid use. Consequently, those with chronic autoimmune or inflammatory disorders are at the highest risk.
Other causes include brain tumors, infiltrative processes (eg, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis), infections (eg, tuberculosis, meningitis, fungal, HIV), and Cushing syndrome cure (removal of the pituitary or an ACTH/cortisol-secreting tumor).
Notably, neonates born to mothers treated with chronic high-dose steroids can also present with TAI. 
Pheochromocytoma
Tumors that arise from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are called pheochromocytomas. Tumors of the sympathetic ganglia are known as catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas or extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas.
Pheochromocytomas produce the catecholamines norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine in response to stimulation by the sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Receptors for the catecholamines are distributed throughout the body and produce physiologic effects such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, smooth muscle dilatation (bronchioles and capillaries), increased metabolism, and blood vessel constriction in the GI tract and skin—all features associated with the body’s stress response.
Diagnostic Considerations
To easily compare similarities and differences in signs, symptoms, and lab results for the three types of AI, Table
Clinical Presentation
Adrenal Crisis
Adrenal crisis is characterized by persistent hypotension and vasodilatory shock despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
Symptoms are often vague, making adrenal crisis a great mimicker of other disease processes, such as sepsis, which can also trigger adrenal crisis.
The most common symptoms include the following: 
Hypotension/shock (90%)
Of note, 50% of patients will not have hypotension before prior to developing frank shock.
Abdominal/flank/back/lower chest pain (86%)
Fever (66%)
Less common symptoms/signs include the following:
Anorexia/nausea/vomiting (47%)
Neuropsychiatric complaints (confusion, delirium, coma) (42%)
Abdominal rebound tenderness or rigidity (22%)
Hypothyroidism
Gonadal failure
Patients are also often hypoglycemic and thus manifest symptoms of hypoglycemia as well.
Physical exam may be notable for an acute surgical abdomen. 
Differential diagnosis includes other causes of shock such as hypovolemia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
In infants, the differential diagnosis should also include pyelonephritis, obstructive uropathy, and tubulointerstitial nephritis, all of which can cause vomiting, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia in this population. 
PAI
Due to its chronic and non-specific symptoms, PAI can be extremely difficult to diagnose. In fact, 20% of patients have symptoms for over 5 y before they are diagnosed, and 54% are only diagnosed after presenting in adrenal crisis. 
Common misdiagnoses include “flu-like” illness, chronic fatigue syndrome, anorexia nervosa, and a variety of GI and psychiatric disorders. 
The most frequent signs and symptoms of PAI include the following: 
Hyperpigmentation (diffuse but most obvious on sun-exposed areas, areas of friction/pressure, palmar creases, and mucous membranes; 41%-94%)
Hypotension defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 110mmHg (88%-94%).
Constitutional symptoms such as weakness or fatigue (84%-100%)
Anorexia (100%)
Weight loss (25%-100%)
Nausea (25%-86%)
Vomiting (25%-75%)
Abdominal pain (49%-62%)
Salt craving (16%-64%)
Less frequent symptoms include the following:
Musculoskeletal complaints (6%-37%)
Abdominal pain (33%)
Constipation (33%)
Amenorrhea (25%)
Postural dizziness (12%-20%)
Vitiligo (10%-20%)
Diarrhea (16%)
Infertility and premature ovarian failure (6%)
Auricular calcification (5%; men only)
The symptoms of PAI result from low cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens, as well as high ACTH.
Lack of cortisol causes weight loss, lethargy, weakness, headache, and GI symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea). 
Low aldosterone leads to salt craving, dehydration, (orthostatic) hypotension, and syncope.
Gonadocorticoid deficiency symptoms (decreased axillary and pubic hair, decreased libido, amenorrhea; 25%) are seen in females. Similar changes are unusual in men given that the testes are responsible for the production of male androgens.
Psychiatric disorders are common among those with severe untreated PAI. Specifically, 20%-40% have depression, 40% have hallucinations, 20%-40% have psychosis, 24% have anxiety, and 12% have mania. Psychiatric symptoms often precede other symptoms, thereby delaying the true diagnosis. Most of these psychiatric complaints resolve within days of glucocorticoid therapy (aside from psychosis, which may take months). 
SAI
A history of recent withdrawal of chronic steroids or symptoms of PAI coupled with signs/symptoms of other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism) should raise concern for SAI.
Presentations are usually indolent in nature but can be acute in the setting of pituitary hemorrhage/necrosis or trauma.
The symptoms of SAI stem from low cortisol.  Common symptoms include the following:
Weight gain, constitutional symptoms (weakness, fatigue, cold intolerance), anorexia, auricular calcification (only in men), GI complaints, myalgias, arthralgias, psychiatric (depression, apathy, psychosis, pseudodementia), thin axillary/pubic hair, decreased libido, infertility, and amenorrhea. 
Other symptoms related to pituitary hormone deficiencies may include visual disturbances, headache, galactorrhea, menstrual disturbances, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, seizures, growth failure, or hypogonadism. 
Unlike PAI, SAI has no hyperpigmentation because ACTH levels are low or normal (melanocytes are not over-stimulated), and hypovolemia and hypotension are less common due to normal aldosterone. 
TAI
TAI is driven by low cortisol levels, and its symptoms are often chronic and largely similar to those of SAI. Figure
Pheochromocytoma
Pheochromocytoma classically presents with the triad of paroxysmal headache, sweating, and tachycardia, often accompanied by hypertension. 
These paroxysmal “spells” may occur monthly, weekly, or daily and last from seconds to hours. The episodes will worsen with tumor progression.
Clinical symptoms include headache (82%), diaphoresis (60%), palpitations (48%), anxiety (35%), dizziness (18%), abdominal pain, flank pain, myalgias, and arthralgias. 
Clinical signs of pheochromocytomas include weight loss, fever, hypertensive crisis, paroxysmal hypertension, malignant hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, shock, diaphoresis, tachycardia, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, myocarditis, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cerebrovascular accidents, intracranial hemorrhages, seizure (7%), hemiplegia, tremors (15%), melena, hematochezia, café au lait spots, neurofibromas, hematuria, pain, pallor, paresthesias, rales, and pulmonary edema. 
Pheochromocytoma multi-system crisis is the most severe presentation, which presents with fever (may exceed 40°C), hypertension or hypotension, encephalopathy, and multi-system organ failure. Mortality rates can exceed 85%.  (Brouwers et al., 2003)
Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in pregnancy is complicated by its similarity to pre-eclampsia, but it is important to distinguish, given its high maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality rates (40.3% and 56%, respectively). The key differences from pre-eclampsia include (1) absence of edema, (2) absence of proteinuria, and (3) onset of hypertension at any gestational stage.  Symptoms can be worse when lying flat in pregnancy.
Radiographic Evaluation
Adrenal Crisis
No radiologic imaging modality is necessary to make this diagnosis.
Target imaging to identify infectious triggers of the adrenal crisis, such as chest X-ray.
PAI
Consider a CT scan of the abdomen to identify primary adrenal disorders, such as tuberculosis (gland enlargement or calcifications; seen only 50% of the time), adrenal hemorrhage, or metastatic infiltration of the adrenal glands. 
Consider chest X-ray for tuberculosis.
SAI and TAI
CT or MRI of the head may be useful in identifying pituitary or hypothalamic disorders, including empty sella syndrome, hemorrhage, brain tumors, cerebral infiltrative, or infectious processes.
Pheochromocytoma
Biochemical confirmation of the pheochromocytoma diagnosis should be followed by radiographic evaluation to locate the tumor.  Around 10%-15% of tumors are extra-adrenal, but 95% are within the abdomen and pelvis. 
Imaging should start with CT with or without contrast of the abdomen and pelvis (sensitivity 93%, specificity 95%) or non-contrast MRI (sensitivity 83%-100%, specificity 93%). 
Laboratory Evaluation
Adrenal Crisis
No prior testing is required in suspected cases of adrenal crisis. Move immediately to treatment.
If the patient is stable, serum cortisol levels can be useful, although their reliability in critically ill patients is controversial. 
A serum cortisol level >20 μg/dL rules out the diagnosis of adrenal crisis. A serum cortisol level <10 μg/dL in a patient with severe sepsis/shock suggests a diagnosis of adrenal crisis, but is not confirmatory.  This will be the case for PAI, SAI, and TAI.
Other testing.
Serum chemistries (for sodium and potassium)
ACTH, aldosterone, renin levels (ideally measured before steroids)
TSH, free thyroxine levels
Coagulation factors
Work-up of infectious triggers: UA, blood and urine cultures, etc.
Cosyntropin stimulation test: If the patient is stable, consider performing a cosyntropin (also known as synacthen or tetracosactide) test. It must be performed before the administration of steroids, except for dexamethasone. The test is controversial as it is likely unreliable in critically ill patients. However, it is endorsed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine as of the latest guidelines in 2017. Table
PAI
The most common lab findings for PAI are hyponatremia (57%-88% of patients), hyperkalemia (30%-85%), azotemia (55%), and hypoglycemia (67%; especially in children and infants). 
Other laboratory abnormalities may include anemia (11%-40%), hypercalcemia (6%-33%), eosinophilia (17%), type 1 diabetes (12%), hypochloremia, and acidosis.
SAI
Unlike PAI, there is no hyperkalemia because aldosterone remains functional.  Consequently, potassium will either be normal or low.
Either hypernatremia (functional aldosterone) or hyponatremia (dilutional due to an inappropriate increase in ADH secretion/action due to cortisol deficiency) may be present.
Severe hypoglycemia may occur and may be the presenting symptom in neonates and children.
Consider testing for other pituitary hormone (growth hormone, thyroxine, TSH, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone) dysfunction and to evaluate for hypopituitarism.
TAI
For ED purposes, TAI has largely the same laboratory results as SAI.
Pheochromocytoma
The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is usually made by measuring urinary and plasma fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines (Figure 3).  The plasma metanephrine test is 96% sensitive and 85% specific, and 24-h urinary collection for catecholamines and metanephrines is 87.5% sensitive and 99.7% specific.  Timely results are difficult to obtain for these tests in the ED setting.
For the most accurate hormonal measurements, it may be necessary to taper and discontinue certain medications when appropriate, such as tricyclic antidepressants. Other medications that increase measured levels of catecholamines and metanephrines include levodopa, adrenergic receptor agonists (decongestants), amphetamines, buspirone and most psychoactive agents, prochlorperazine, reserpine, and ethanol; withdrawal from clonidine and other drugs can also cause increased measurements.
Genetic testing should be considered in patients with paragangliomas, bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas, family history of a linked genetic disorder, or other clinical findings suggestive of a syndromic disorder. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Adrenal Crisis
If there is concern for adrenal crisis in a patient, begin empiric treatment immediately. Do not wait for any lab results.
The mainstays of treatment include IV steroids, IV fluids, vasopressors as needed, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Table
For IV steroids, 2 options exist: hydrocortisone and dexamethasone.
In cases with a prior history of AI, hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef) is preferred, especially if the patient is hypotensive or has lab findings consistent with PAI (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), due to its glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects. 
If the patient is stable and/or has no prior diagnosis of AI, consider giving dexamethasone instead because this will not interfere with any subsequent cosyntropin stimulation testing in the next 24 h. 
If concurrent clinical hypothyroidism is present, supplement thyroxine as needed. Mineralocorticoid supplementation is not required in the acute setting.
Prioritize the identification and treatment of any underlying triggers (eg, infection, myocardial infarction, trauma).
Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary AI
Stress dose steroids: For AI patients who are ill or injured but not in adrenal crisis, the ED physician should consider adjusting subsequent steroid dosing.
If undergoing a major stressor (surgery, trauma, childbirth), 100-200 mg hydrocortisone should be administered over 24 h.
Hydrocortisone is preferred for stress dosing over dexamethasone or prednisone because of its rapid onset and mineralocorticoid effects, especially in PAI patients. 
For minor illnesses or injuries, begin stress steroid dosing at double to triple the chronic maintenance dose for 24-72 h and/or until symptoms improve.  Urgent follow-up with Primary Care and Endocrinology should be arranged within 24 h.
Pheochromocytoma
The goal of ED treatment is to medically stabilize the patient for surgery, which is the only curative measure. Table
Recent studies have shown that emergency or urgent surgical resection is associated with higher rates of complications compared with medical management followed by elective surgery. 
Medical management begins with controlling hypertension and tachycardia. Alpha blockage should precede any other anti-hypertensive medications to avoid paradoxical hypertension.
Start with phentolamine, a short-acting, non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker (2.5-5 mg IV bolus followed by 1 mg/min infusion).
Phenoxybenzamine is a long-acting, irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker. Dosing usually starts at 10 mg PO and is increased daily until blood pressure is controlled.
Sodium nitroprusside, a vasodilator, can then be effectively used for blood pressure control at an infusion of 0.3-0.5 μg/kg/min; titrate to effect (max 10 μg/kg/min).
Nicardipine or clevidipine may also be used for hypertension.
Outpatient Treatment
PAI
Patients with PAI require daily supplementation of their missing glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) hormones. The regimen should be determined in conjunction with an endocrinologist.
SAI and TAI
Patients with SAI and TAI require daily supplementation of their missing glucocorticoid (cortisol). This should be determined in conjunction with an endocrinologist.
Mineralocorticoid and androgen replacements are not required.
Pheochromocytoma
Agents known to provoke a pheochromocytoma paroxysm should be avoided. Examples include beta blockers in the absence of alpha blockade, glucagon, histamine, or metoclopramide.
The most common preoperative drug is phenoxybenzamine.
Metyrosine is controversial and should be used only in patients who cannot be treated with typical alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade because of intolerance or for cardiopulmonary reasons. 
There is no consensus on the ideal preoperative treatment. Alpha blockers followed by calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and angiotensin-receptor blockers have been used. Decisions may be dependent on drug availability and practice patterns. 
Patients should start a high-sodium diet (>5,000 mg daily) 2-3 d after medications are initiated to counteract the catecholamine-induced volume contraction and possible hypotension associated with alpha-adrenergic blockade. This would be contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency or congestive heart failure.
Once the patient is stable, a laparoscopic adrenalectomy by an endocrine surgeon is preferred to open laparotomy. Following surgery, 24-h admission to an ICU is recommended to monitor for postoperative complications, such as hypotension and hypoglycemia.
Patients with familial or malignant pheochromocytomas may be eligible for a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy or may need a complete bilateral adrenalectomy, depending on the disease type and severity.
Disposition
Adrenal Crisis
All adrenal crisis patients should be admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and serial labs.
Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary AI
Patients with a history of AI who present with mild physiologic stressors may very rarely be discharged from the ED once the illness is managed and stress dose steroids are begun. Endocrinology should be consulted in making this disposition.
Patients with insidious presentations of AI with no acute illness can be further evaluated and treated on an outpatient basis. Refer for close Endocrinology and Primary Care follow-up.
Pheochromocytoma
Patients who have pheochromocytoma with multi-organ systemic failure or who require IV infusions to control blood pressure and heart rate will require admission to the ICU.
Stable patients may be discharged home with oral medications during the preoperative period but require routine blood pressure monitoring.
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
Adrenal Insufficiency
Because many patients with AI are diagnosed for the first time in a crisis setting, inform the patient that they may require lifelong glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen supplementation once the etiology of their AI is identified.
On an outpatient basis with Endocrinology, the type of AI can be further investigated using baseline early morning cortisol and ACTH levels, plasma renin, and serum aldosterone levels. Cosyntropin and/or CRH stimulation testing can also be performed.
Pheochromocytoma
Surgical management of a pheochromocytoma does not guarantee a long-term cure regardless of the type of tumor initially encountered. More than 15% of patients will have a recurrent tumor, which will sometimes be malignant.  Annual biochemical screening is required in all patients; recurrence is more likely in patients with familial disease, right adrenal tumors, or extra-adrenal tumors or paragangliomas.  Patients who have undergone adrenalectomies are at risk for AI and may require lifelong glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen supplementation.
Prevention
Adrenal Crisis
Patients on chronic steroids should be trained in “sick day rules” in order to prevent an adrenal crisis. Patients should carry an emergency kit with 100 mg of hydrocortisone IM for use in the event of serious illness or injury. After taking the steroid, they should seek immediate medical care. 
Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary AI
For PAI, daily glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementations are essential to control patients’ symptoms.
For SAI and TAI, daily glucocorticoid supplementation (with tapering as needed) is essential to control patients’ symptoms.
If AI patients are ill or injured, see the stress dose steroid dosing recommendations given above.
Pheochromocytoma
Agents known to provoke a pheochromocytoma paroxysm should be avoided. Examples include beta blockers in the absence of an alpha blockade, glucagon, histamine, and metoclopramide.",Adrenal Emergencies

EM:RAP Link
EM:RAP Audio: 2017 June - Hypoglycemia
Key Concepts
Presenting complaints in diabetic emergencies may be non-specific, and checking the blood glucose level should be considered early in the evaluation of undifferentiated patients, especially those with altered mental status or focal neurological deficits.
Identification of precipitating factors is critical when caring for patients presenting with hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is usually due to medication in all populations except neonates (please see the neonatal emergency chapter for information about neonatal hypoglycemia).
Diagnosis
Textbook presentation: A patient with insulin-dependent diabetes presents with diaphoresis and altered mental status. The patient is noted to be tachycardic on exam and is confused with slurred speech. The patient has a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The point-of-care glucose is 41 mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L).
PEARLS
The history should focus on the medication history, including both diabetic and non-diabetic medications, history of oral intake, and symptoms of other possible triggers for hypoglycemia, such as infection or ischemia.
Whipple’s triad is a set of diagnostic criteria to define hypoglycemic symptoms. The triad comprises symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, a low glucose level, and relief of the symptoms when glucose is replenished.
Symptoms of hypoglycemia are either autonomic or neuroglycopenic in origin. However, they are non-specific for the diagnosis of hypoglycemia.
Point-of-care glucose should be provided rapidly for any undifferentiated patient with altered mental status and/or focal neurologic deficit.
There is no universally defined blood glucose level for hypoglycemia because patients may be symptomatic at different blood glucose levels.
Treatment
Monitor airway, breathing, and circulation.
If the patient is obtunded or seizing and has IV access (intraosseous access can be used as well):
Adults and children older than 8 y:
Dextrose 50% (D50W) 50 mL (25 g) (1 ampule) in adults, IV bolus, or 0.5-1 g/kg (1-2 mL/kg in children >8 y of age)
Dextrose 10% (D10W) 250 mL (25 g) IV bolus
Children between the ages of 2 mo and 8 y:
Dextrose 25% (D25W) 0.5-1 g/kg (2-4 mL/kg) IV bolus
Children under 2 mo:
D10W: 0.5-1 g/kg (5-10 mL/kg) IV bolus
If an obtunded or seizing patient does not have IV access:
Weight >20 kg
Administer glucagon 1 mg IM
May repeat in 15 min
Note: requires adequate glycogen stores, which may be absent in malnourished patients
Weight <20 kg
Administer glucagon 0.5 mg IM
May repeat in 15 min
Note: requires adequate glycogen stores, which may be absent in malnourished patients
PEARLS
Early recognition and treatment are key. Be sure to document the time of onset and interventions well.
Repeated blood glucose testing each hour is critical and should be carefully documented.
PITFALLS
Patients on sulfonylureas are at risk for recurrent and delayed-onset hypoglycemia. Contact poison control center or a medical toxicologist for guidance. All cases of hypoglycemia attributed to sulfonylurea toxicity require 24 hours of monitored observation. If patients receive octreotide, observation should continue until 24 hours after the last dose of octreotide.
PEARLS
If the patient is hypoglycemic, immediately give a dextrose IV or IO bolus. May feed patient or administer oral dextrose if the patient is able to take it safely. If the patient is symptomatic, dextrose IV or IO is recommended. Glucagon IM can be given but requires endogenous glycogen stores.
PITFALLS
Octreotide prevents further insulin release but does not reverse the insulin effect.
Octreotide is generally reserved for recurrent hypoglycemic episodes and requires monitored observation. Consult poison control center or medical toxicologist for guidance.
Adults
Octreotide 50-100 μg SC preferred but can be given IV q6-12h
Children
Octreotide 1 μg/kg (max 50 μg) SC preferred but can be given IV q6-12h
If the patient is alert and can swallow safely, give glucose-containing fluids (eg, juice).
Check fingersticks every hour until glucose is maintained without intervention.
If hypoglycemia recurs, administer dextrose IV bolus and start a maintenance infusion of D10W.
Disposition
Disposition depends on the underlying etiology of the hypoglycemic episode and the stability of glucose in the emergency department (ED).
If a patient’s hypoglycemia can be attributed to inadequate oral (PO) intake or an inadvertent increase in short-acting or intermediate-acting insulin, the patient is alert, tolerating PO, and clinically stable, and glucose is stable on multiple rechecks, the patient may be discharged.
Otherwise, the patient should be admitted to a monitored bed.
Patients requiring more frequent fingerstick glucose checks on dextrose infusions may require a higher level of care, such as in an intermediate medical care unit or intensive care unit (ICU), depending on local institutional policies regarding the frequency of fingerstick monitoring.
If sulfonylurea poisoning is suspected or confirmed, the patient is at risk for recurrent hypoglycemia and should be admitted for monitoring and consideration of ongoing octreotide therapy. Consult poison control center or medical toxicologist. (See Chapter: Hypoglycemic Agents)",Diabetic Hypoglycemia
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
The true incidence of hypoglycemia is unknown. Some patients experience hypoglycemic symptoms and recognize and treat them without checking a fingerstick glucose. Similarly, some providers attribute any symptoms appearing to be hypoglycemia to hypoglycemia and do not check glucose levels.
From 2006 to 2009, estimates indicate approximately 300,000 diabetic patient visits to an ED for hypoglycemia. 
In diabetic patients, most hypoglycemic episodes requiring emergency care (60% in one study) are related to medication. 
Medication-related hypoglycemia is most commonly due to insulin, and patients taking insulin have a much higher rate of hypoglycemia than patients taking non-insulin medications. 
Sulfonylureas are the most common non-insulin medications inducing hypoglycemia, and they account for approximately one-tenth of medication-related hypoglycemic presentations. 
People with type 1 diabetes are more commonly affected by hypoglycemia than people with type 2 diabetes, including the spectrum from asymptomatic hypoglycemia to severe hypoglycemic events. 
Infection and worsening kidney function are other common causes of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.
In non-diabetic patients, the most common causes include infection, liver disease, and malignancy. 
Other endocrinopathies can induce hypoglycemia, such as adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism.
Insulinoma, an insulin-producing tumor, is another cause of hypoglycemia; however, its incidence is very rare.
Death from hypoglycemia in an emergency setting is very rare (less than 1:1,000, according to one study). 
Pathophysiology
Glucose is the main source of energy for the brain. When glucose becomes low, several counter-regulatory hormones are released, such as glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone.
Hypoglycemia in people with diabetes is usually due to medications, most commonly insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents.
Decreased oral intake or increased medication intake (whether intentional or inadvertent) can lead to hypoglycemia.
The table Non-insulin diabetic medications and their mechanisms of action lists diabetic medications and their mechanisms of action. Several combination medications are also listed. Table
Other acute medical processes such as infection, ischemia, worsening kidney function, and pancreatitis can also trigger hypoglycemia through upregulation of metabolic processes demanding glucose.
Insulin is renally cleared; therefore, worsening kidney function can cause insulin to last longer, thus leading to hypoglycemia.
In non-diabetic patients, the most common causes of hypoglycemia include infection, liver disease, and malignancy.  Malnutrition can also lead to hypoglycemia. Liver disease leads to impaired glycogen storage and breakdown as well as impaired gluconeogenesis. Alcoholics are at the highest risk because of alcohol-induced liver disease coupled with poor nutrition.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
There is no universally defined blood glucose level for hypoglycemia because patients may show symptoms of “low” blood glucose at different levels. Patients with chronically high blood glucose may become symptomatically hypoglycemic with blood glucose higher than that in patients with normal baseline glucose levels.
The history should include a thorough medication history and an oral intake history in terms of when medications were last taken and how much, as well as the timing of the last meal and the contents of the meal. Providers should also search for other possible etiologies such as infection or ischemia. Signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies, such as cold intolerance, constipation, and weight gain for hypothyroidism, or a history of chronic steroid use with vomiting for adrenal insufficiency, should also be investigated.
Symptoms are highly non-specific. Symptoms are divided into autonomic and neuroglycopenic. Autonomic symptoms are generated from the autonomic nervous system and thus are catecholamine driven. Tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, tremor, and hunger are examples of these symptoms. Neuroglycopenic symptoms are generated because of the brain’s lack of glucose, causing decreased function. Altered sensorium, dizziness, weakness, seizures, and coma are examples of these symptoms. 
Hypoglycemia is the most likely diagnosis if symptoms abate after glucose administration. However, if these symptoms persist, alternative diagnoses should be considered and investigated.
Radiographic Evaluation
There is no role for radiographic studies in the diagnosis of hypoglycemia.
Imaging studies ordered should focus on searching for an inciting cause of the disease process, such as infection or ischemia.
Computed tomography imaging imaging of patients with focal neurologic deficits is appropriate after hypoglycemia has been ruled out or addressed.
Laboratory Evaluation
Rapidly obtained point-of-care glucose is critical in any patient with altered mental status or focal neurological deficit.
The severity of hypoglycemia is related to symptoms and not to glucose levels. Some patients who are chronically hyperglycemic may become symptomatic at levels relatively close to normal.
The rest of the workup should depend on the history and physical exam. Screening lab results that should be sent should search for an etiology, such as infection. If the etiology is simply overmedication or underconsumption of nutrition, the workup can be very minimal. A screening creatinine level is recommended because patients may not be symptomatic from renal insufficiency.
Therapeutic Considerations
Glucose supplementation is the mainstay of therapy in patients with hypoglycemia. Patients who do not receive glucose supplementation in a timely manner are at risk of seizures, coma, and subsequent death or permanent neurologic disability.
Dextrose in water is available in multiple concentrations (eg, 5% to 50%).
In patients who are seizing or severely neurologically impaired, the highest concentration is recommended to deliver dextrose to the brain to reverse the impairment. However, several emergency medical service studies suggest that there is no difference between 50% dextrose and 10% dextrose in terms of time to reversal of symptoms. 
There is, however, a difference in osmolarity between 10% dextrose and 50% dextrose. 50% dextrose has an osmolarity of 2,525 mOsm, which is very hyperosmolar. There are 2 case reports of patients who had extravasation of 50% dextrose, one of whom developed compartment syndrome and required operative intervention.  The osmolarity of 10% dextrose is 505 mOsm and is much safer if extravasation occurs. Dextrose 10% 250 mL is equivalent to 50 mL of 50% dextrose; both contain 25 g of dextrose.
If mental status improves with glucose correction, the patient must be monitored for recurrent hypoglycemia with frequent glucose checks; the appropriate duration of monitoring depends on the underlying etiology of hypoglycemia (medication effect versus triggers such as infection).
In patients who are awake and able to swallow, oral nutritional intake is preferred. Oral glucose load in the form of juice is preferred, because it is quickly absorbed and tolerated.
After a patient is more awake and alert after initial stabilization, a more balanced meal containing fat, protein, and carbohydrates is recommended to provide substrates for longer storage and breakdown should hypoglycemia recur.
In patients taking sulfonylurea, octreotide administration is recommended for recurrent hypoglycemia. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that prevents further release of insulin from sulfonylureas.
Patients who are unable to swallow or who are not maintaining a euglycemic state despite oral nutritional intake require dextrose infusion. Isotonic fluids with dextrose added such as D5 normal saline (D5NS) or D5 Lactated Ringer’s (D5LR) are preferred so as to avoid hyponatremia. Dextrose concentration may need to up-titrated to D10 or D25 in patients who are continuing to become hypoglycemic despite D5 or who are volume-restricted such as patients with renal failure or congestive heart failure.
Care After Successful Treatment
Hypoglycemic patients should be educated on adequate nutrition and precursor symptoms of hypoglycemia and should be prompted to ingest glucose to prevent worsened symptoms.
Hospital discharge planning should involve conclusive identification of the factors that precipitated the hypoglycemic crisis and education of patients and families regarding home care and return precautions.
Prevention
Pharmacists, social workers, and case managers in EDs can help patients understand their medications, use them safely, and access care.",Diabetic Hypoglycemia
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Place patient on cardiac monitor and continuous pulse oximetry.
Secure intravenous (IV) access.
Obtain point-of-care glucose.
AIRWAY/BREATHING
Intubation should be avoided, if possible.
It is very hard to match the minute ventilation of Kussmaul respirations (deep, labored breathing of severe metabolic acidosis) using positive pressure ventilation.
If patient has fatigued to the point that they can no longer maximize their minute ventilation or is obtunded and airway protection is of concern, intubate as quickly and carefully as possible.
RSI with rocuronium is preferred, as succinylcholine may exacerbate underlying electrolyte imbalance
Preoxygenate and deliver breaths via BVM while preparing for intubation to minimize apnea
Most experienced operator should intubate for highest likelihood of first pass success
Set respiratory rate on ventilator to at least 30 initially to try to match pre-intubation minute ventilation
CIRCULATION
Initiate IV fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid at 20 mL/kg followed by maintenance fluids provided at twice maintenance (unless the patient has underlying cardiac or renal disease).
An electrocardiogram can alert the clinician to life-threatening hypo- and hyperkalemia before lab results are available.
Check the potassium level:
If potassium is ≥3.3 mEq/L (≥3.3 mmol/L), start insulin infusion.
If potassium is <3.3 mEq/L (<3.3 mmol/L), replenish potassium before initiating insulin infusion.
Provide IV insulin infusion 0.1 unit/kg/h.
Replenish potassium: maintain potassium levels of at least 3.3 mEq/L (3.3 mmol/L).
Reserve sodium bicarbonate for severe hyperkalemia, cardiac arrest, and profound shock due to circulatory collapse from acidosis.
Perform fingerstick glucose checks every hour and serum electrolytes every 2 hours.
If glucose drops below 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) before acidosis corrects, add dextrose 5% in water (D5W) to the IV fluids.
DISABILITY
Check mental status every hour.
If cerebral edema is suspected:
The diagnosis is clinical; do not wait for imaging.
Stop IV fluids.
Elevate the head of the bed.
Perform osmotic diuresis:
Mannitol 0.5-1 g/kg, IV over 20-30 min or
Hypertonic 3% sodium chloride 3-5 mL/kg IV over 15-20 min
EXPOSURE
A complete survey is indicated, searching for potential triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) such as infection (eg, a cutaneous abscess).
Additional tests to consider:
Point-of-care pregnancy (urine or blood).
Blood: complete blood count (CBC), cultures as needed.
Urine: urinalysis (UA), cultures as needed.
Imaging: as indicated by history and physical.

EM:RAP Audio: 2019 February - Rural Medicine - DKA In The Village
Key Concepts
DKA is associated with substantial dehydration and life-threatening electrolyte shifts.
Patients in DKA are almost always deficient in total-body potassium, even when serum levels are normal or slightly elevated.
Intubation should be avoided in DKA if possible.
Presenting complaints in diabetic emergencies may be non-specific, and checking the blood glucose level should be considered early in the evaluation of undifferentiated patients, especially those with altered mental status or focal neurological deficits.
Identification of precipitating factors is critical when caring for patients presenting with hypoglycemia, DKA, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Hypoglycemia is usually due to medication. The most common trigger of hyperglycemic emergencies is infection.
Cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in children with DKA but is very rare in adults.
Diagnosis
Textbook presentation: A patient with type 1 diabetes presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, or polydipsia. Physical exam findings include very dry mucous membranes. There is notable fruity breath and Kussmaul breathing. The patient is slightly confused.
DKA is a common first presentation for type 1 diabetes (estimates vary widely depending on location and patient age) and should be considered in young patients without known diabetes. 
Abdominal pain and tenderness are common in DKA and are present in 25%-46% of patients with DKA. 
Diagnostic criteria for DKA include the following: glucose >250 mg/dL (>13.9 mmol/L), pH ≤7.3, serum bicarbonate ≤18 mEq/L (18 mmol/L), presence of ketones in serum and urine, and anion gap >17 mEq/L. 
Euglycemic DKA or DKA with glucose <250 mg/dL may be seen in alcoholic or pregnant patients or in patients on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.
The severity of DKA can be defined as mild, moderate, or severe according to the severity of acidosis (pH, serum bicarbonate, and anion gap).
Cerebral edema is very rare in DKA (0.7%-1.0% of children with DKA) but is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and is seen almost exclusively in children. 
Treatment
Monitor airway, breathing, and circulation.
Provide IV fluids:
Initial bolus of isotonic crystalloid at 20 mL/kg followed by isotonic crystalloid at twice maintenance (unless the patient has underlying congestive heart failure or renal disease).
If potassium is between 3.3 and 5.3 mEq/L (3.3-5.3 mmol/L), add potassium at 20 mEq/L to each liter of maintenance fluid after the initial bolus.
If glucose drops below 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) before correction of acidosis, add D5W to maintenance fluids.
Give potassium supplementation as needed to maintain a potassium level of at least 3.3 mEq/L (3.3 mmol/L) before starting insulin infusion.
Provide insulin infusion; do not start until potassium is at least 3.3 mEq/L (3.3 mmol/L) with regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/h.
Continue insulin infusion until two of the following conditions are met:
Serum bicarbonate ≥15 mEq/L (≥15 mmol/L)
pH >7.3
Anion gap ≤12 mEq/L (≤12 mmol/L)
After resolution of DKA has been established according to repeat lab testing, give long-acting insulin, subcutaneously, 2 h before discontinuation of insulin infusion.
Give sodium bicarbonate only if the patient has severe hyperkalemia, cardiac arrest, or profound shock from acidosis.
PEARLS
Perform fingerstick glucose check every hour.
Check serum electrolytes every 2 h to assess acidosis, anion gap, and potassium.
Supplement potassium as needed to maintain a level of at least 3.3 mEq/L (3.3 mmol/L).
Document all lab results and subsequent therapy changes.
PERSPECTIVES
We recommend using a table with time on the x-axis and glucose, electrolytes, calculated anion gap, and current orders (IV fluid and rate, insulin drip rate) on the y- axis.
Avoid intubation of patients in DKA if possible.
For cerebral edema:
Initiate treatment as soon as the diagnosis is suspected.
Elevate the head of the bed to 30°.
Discontinue IV fluids.
Provide osmotic diuresis:
Mannitol, 0.5-1 g/kg IV over 20-30 min (can be repeated at 2 h if needed)
Hypertonic 3% sodium chloride 3-5 mL/kg IV over 15-20 min
PEARLS
Patients with cerebral edema require serial neurologic exams, which should be documented at least hourly to evaluate progress and/or need for further intervention.
Disposition
Admission is required for most patients.
Patients with mild DKA who have had their DKA corrected in the emergency department (ED) and whose DKA etiology is due to insulin non-compliance may be discharged with instructions to monitor their glucose more frequently.
The level of care should depend on the patient’s mental status, degree of acidosis, and any concomitant or precipitating factors identified, as well as local institutional policies regarding management of insulin infusions.
Patients with depressed mental status, cerebral edema, refractory hypotension, or persistent anion-gap metabolic acidosis will require intensive care unit (ICU) admission.",Diabetic Ketoacidosis
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
DKA is more common in patients with type 1 than type 2 diabetes, by a ratio of approximately 2:1. 
Patients are often in DKA during their first presentation with diabetes, especially in the younger population.
According to one systematic literature review, the prevalence of DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes was between 50 and 100 per 1,000 person-years. 
DKA is more common in people with type 1 diabetes who are younger, female, non-white, or taking insulin injections (versus pump therapy). 
Hospitalizations for DKA decreased from 2000 to 2009; however, from 2009 to 2014, they significantly increased. The proposed causes include newer medications that can cause DKA and decreased provider thresholds for hospitalization. 
According to two studies, the recurrence rates of DKA are higher in patients with low socioeconomic status, usually because of insulin non-compliance and poor comprehension of the disease process.  These patients have also been found to have higher mortality.
The mortality rate in DKA is less than 1% in adults but higher in very young and very old people.  Mortality rates have been steadily decreasing because of increased recognition and improved management algorithms.
Cerebral edema is a deadly complication occurring in 0.3%-1% of children in DKA, but it is almost never seen in patients older than 20 y. 
Cerebral edema is the leading cause of death in pediatric DKA; it has been associated with mortality in approximately 20% of cases and with long-term neurologic sequelae in another 20% of cases in one major study. 
Pathophysiology
The endocrine system regulates normal glucose metabolism in the body, primarily via the pancreas; however, the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland also play a role.
The pancreas secretes glucagon in response to low-glycemic states. Glucagon acts by prompting the body to start synthesizing new glucose from byproducts (gluconeogenesis), breaking down glycogen stored in the liver into glucose (glycogenolysis), and breaking down fat into fatty acids to make ketone bodies (ketogenesis).
Ketone bodies are the primary source of energy for the brain when levels of glucose, the brain’s normal source of energy, are low. The primary ketone bodies are acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.
The pancreas secretes insulin in response to euglycemic and hyperglycemic states. Insulin acts by prompting the body to begin utilizing glucose for energy where needed. It also acts by telling the body to store excess glucose as glycogen and fat. Finally, insulin acts by turning off the actions of glucagon.
DKA is characterized by ketosis and acidosis with an underlying absolute insulin deficiency.
Without insulin, cells cannot mobilize dietary glucose, thus leading the body to operate as if it is in a low-glycemic state. Therefore, counter-regulatory hormones (most notably glucagon) are secreted, increasing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Glucose released from these upregulated processes contributes to worsening hyperglycemia.
Additionally, lipolysis leads to the creation of ketone bodies to provide a source of energy to the brain. However, the predominance of these acidic ketone bodies leads to anion-gap metabolic acidosis and contributes to the severity of the disease. The predominant ketone body generated is beta-hydroxybutyrate, at a 10:1 ratio to acetoacetate.
Hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis due to glucose spilling into the urine from decreased renal reabsorption of glucose. Glucose in the urine leads to increased urinary excretion of water and consequently to dehydration.
Fluid exits cells because of the osmotic effect of excess glucose and consequently dilutes sodium concentrations, a response commonly known as pseudohyponatremia. Sodium correction should be based on the more accurate Hillier formula:
US conventional units: corrected sodium in mEq/L = measured sodium in mEq/L + 0.024 × (serum glucose in mg/dL − 100). 
SI units: corrected sodium in mmol/L = measured sodium in mmol/L + 0.024 × (18 × serum glucose in mmol/L − 100).
Potassium is regularly lost in DKA. People in DKA have a high propensity to vomit, which decreases potassium. Additionally, the osmotic diuresis leads to increased renal excretion of potassium. However, potassium ions buffer hydrogen ions in acidosis, leading to a higher amount of extracellular potassium. Consequently, total-body potassium levels are often significantly lower than the initial serum potassium levels would suggest.
People in DKA typically manifest a compensatory respiratory alkalosis to counteract the profound metabolic acidosis. They attempt to compensate by breathing off CO2 by increasing the rate and volume of respiration.
The Winters’ formula can be used to determine the expected partial pressure of CO2 to evaluate the patient’s degree of compensation. It can be calculated as follows: expected partial pressure of CO2 = 1.5 × HCO3− + 8 ± 2.
Intubation should be avoided if possible in a patient with DKA, because mechanically matching the patient’s own compensatory respiratory drive is very difficult.
If intubation is needed, note the patient’s respiratory rate before intubation, and try to reproduce that same minute ventilation with the ventilator settings.
The time between paralysis and successful passage of the endotracheal tube should be absolutely minimized, because during that time, when the patient is not breathing or being ventilated artificially (ie, there is no ongoing respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis), the pH will decrease. Inexperienced providers should not learn to intubate on these patients.
Immediately after successful intubation, begin bagging the patient at the same rate at which the patient was breathing before paralysis, and use appropriate ventilator settings to reproduce the patient’s respiratory compensation.
The most common causes of hyperglycemia development and subsequent DKA are infection, ischemia, and insulin non-compliance; infection is the most common cause worldwide.
Medications can also induce DKA, even in patients who were not previously diabetic. Steroids are known for their hyperglycemic properties. Antipsychotics are an uncommonly known cause of hyperglycemia and can also induce DKA. Other medications include fluoroquinolones, thiazide diuretics, and beta blockers.
Cerebral edema
No definitive cause for cerebral edema in DKA has been determined, and the cause is likely to be multifactorial.
Rapid fluid and electrolyte shifts have been suggested to increase the risk of cerebral edema in children with DKA, but the incidence of cerebral edema has not changed with the adoption of more gradual resuscitation protocols, and some children develop cerebral edema before treatment initiation.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms are often non-specific in early diabetic emergencies and may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and malaise.
Gastrointestinal complaints are common in patients in DKA. Abdominal pain was found to be present in 46% of patients in DKA in one study, and it appeared to correlate with the amount of acidosis present.  Nausea and vomiting are more common in DKA than in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and are also correlated with the amount of acidosis.
Patients in DKA often do not mount a fever, even in the setting of infection. 
The time course for hyperglycemic crises can help differentiate between DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: DKA usually develops rapidly, over hours to days, whereas hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state usually develops over weeks.
Children in DKA often have altered mentation or lethargy, and distinguishing between altered mental status due to DKA and neurologic changes related to cerebral edema can be difficult; therefore, keeping cerebral edema in mind while evaluating young people in DKA is important. Neurologic symptoms are more commonly related to the severity of acidosis.
Patients are clinically dehydrated on exam, and adults average a fluid deficit of 6 L. 
Tachypnea is also present on exam in patients with DKA because of the compensatory mechanism for the metabolic acidosis.
Diagnosis of cerebral edema is clinical, because imaging is often initially normal. Cerebral edema should be suspected if the patient has one diagnostic criterion, two major criteria, or one major and two minor criteria  as follows:
Diagnostic criteria
Posturing
Abnormal response to pain
Cranial nerve palsy
Neurologic respiratory pattern
Major criteria
Altered or fluctuating mental status
Sustained decrease in heart rate of 20 bpm without an obvious cause such as fluid resuscitation
Incontinence in a normally continent patient
Minor criteria
Vomiting (after treatment, if the patient initially presented with vomiting)
Headache
Lethargy
Diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg
Age <5 y
Radiographic Evaluation
There is no role for radiographic studies in the diagnosis of DKA.
Imaging studies ordered should focus on searching for an inciting cause of the disease process, such as infection or ischemia.
Imaging findings often lag behind clinical features in cerebral edema. Therefore, treatment should begin before imaging is obtained.
Laboratory Evaluation
The first test for any suspected diabetic emergency should be point-of-care glucose. Rapidly obtained point-of-care glucose is critical in any patient with altered mental status or focal neurological deficit.
Diagnostic criteria for DKA include the following:
Glucose >250 mg/dL (>13.9 mmol/L)
Anion gap >17 mEq/L (>17 mmol/L)
pH ≤7.3
Serum bicarbonate ≤18 mEq/L (≤18 mmol/L)
Serum or urinary ketones
These levels can be relative to a patient’s baseline. For example, if a patient has a co-occurring process leading to alkalosis, they may be in DKA despite initially near-normal pH and bicarbonate levels.
Additionally, patients taking sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have a higher risk of developing euglycemic DKA. Therefore, the clinical picture should outweigh the laboratory values.
Initial testing should include point-of-care blood glucose and lab work including serum electrolytes, venous blood gases, serum ketones (if available), and UA (for ketones).
There is no benefit to testing arterial blood gas rather than venous blood gases in evaluating DKA, and arterial blood gas need not be assessed routinely. The difference between the partial pressure of CO2 and the pH is not statistically significant.
Beta-hydroxybutyrate is the main ketone produced by ketogenesis in DKA. However, because urine assays test for acetoacetate, urine ketone testing may lag behind other clinical and laboratory markers of DKA.
The remainder of the workup should focus on the history and physical, searching for an etiology.
Therapeutic Considerations
Initial therapy begins with IV fluid resuscitation. Although patients in DKA are insulin deficient, initiating insulin therapy before fluid replenishment can push glucose out of the circulating blood volume and into tissue. Glucose leaving the circulating blood volume pulls water along with it, potentially resulting in circulatory collapse in an already volume-depleted patient.
The recommended fluid is isotonic crystalloid; 0.9% sodium chloride has been recommended by several governing bodies as the fluid of choice. However, several studies have evaluated 0.9% sodium chloride and other more balanced solutions, such as Plasmalyte and lactated Ringer’s solution, and found a higher incidence of hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis in patients who received 0.9% sodium chloride. Comparatively, the study comparing 0.9% normal saline with Plasmalyte also indicated less potassium and faster resolution of the acidosis in patients who received Plasmalyte. Therefore, balanced solutions should be used, if available, and 0.9% sodium chloride is an acceptable second option.
Insulin infusion should be initiated after the potassium level is known. Insulin infusion pushes potassium into the cell, lowering the serum potassium level and placing the patient at risk for development of hypokalemia. Therefore, it is recommended that the insulin infusion not be initiated until the potassium level is above 3.3 mEq/L (3.3 mmol/L). Potassium supplementation should continue during the insulin infusion.
Insulin infusion should be started at 0.1 units/kg/h. An insulin bolus is no longer recommended when starting an insulin infusion.  Some studies have compared insulin infusion and administering subcutaneous ultra-rapid-acting insulin every 1 to 2 h in patients with mild or moderate DKA; no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups.
The target of insulin therapy in DKA is resolution of acidosis (not resolution of hyperglycemia), and insulin should be continued until two of the following are found on repeat lab draws: serum bicarbonate ≥15 mEq/L (≥15 mmol/L), pH >7.3, and anion gap ≤12 mEq/L (≤12 mmol/L).  If the patient’s glucose decreases to <250 mg/dL (<13.9 mmol/L) before the acidosis resolves, add dextrose to the maintenance fluids.
There is little role for sodium bicarbonate in routine DKA with significant acidosis because bicarbonate is metabolized to CO2, which is then sent to the lungs for respiratory ventilation, and the respiratory compensatory mechanism is already maximized in DKA.  Sodium bicarbonate has some potential utility in patients with profound hyperkalemia, cardiac arrest, and profound acidosis leading to shock.
Although potassium evaluation and repletion are critical in DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, aggressive repletion of other electrolytes such as phosphate is not necessary during the early resuscitation phase of hyperglycemic emergencies, and aggressive repletion of phosphate may cause hypocalcemia. 
Frequent monitoring of patients with repeat laboratory testing and neurological testing during treatment for DKA is critical to avoid common complications of treatment, such as hypoglycemia and hypokalemia.
Patients taking sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may present with DKA without hyperglycemia.  These patients are preferentially treated with simultaneous insulin infusion along with dextrose infusion to prevent hypoglycemia.
Cerebral edema should be treated aggressively to prevent mortality. Cease all IV fluids. Raise the head of the bed to 35° to decrease intracranial pressure. Administer osmotic diuretics. Mannitol is the drug of choice because it has a good safety profile and is effective. Hypertonic 3% sodium chloride is an alternative and equally useful. However, one retrospective study suggested a correlation between hypertonic saline use and death. 
Care After Successful Treatment
Almost all patients presenting in DKA at EDs are admitted to the hospital, many to ICUs.
Hospital discharge planning should involve conclusive identification of the factors that precipitated the hyperglycemic crisis and education of patients and families regarding home care and return precautions.
Prevention
DKA is more common in patients with low socioeconomic status and poor access to health care.
Limited access to care and poor health literacy contribute to recurrent hyperglycemic crises and increased mortality. 
Although most patients presenting at EDs in DKA are admitted to the hospital, their presentations still represent an opportunity for education of patients and families.
Pharmacists, social workers, and case managers in EDs can help patients understand their medications, use them safely, and access care.",Diabetic Ketoacidosis

Key Concepts
Hypercalcemia
Hypercalcemia is predominantly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia of malignancy.
Hypercalcemia can result in significant morbidity and mortality (particularly when secondary to malignancy).
The majority of patients with hypercalcemia present without symptoms and are detected incidentally.
Symptomatic patients classically present with the following mnemonic: “Stones, bones, groans, and psychiatric overtones.”
Hypercalcemia occurs on a spectrum from mild to severe (ie, hypercalcemic crisis).
The degree of hypercalcemia and the clinical presentation will determine management and disposition.
The mainstay of treatment involves fluid replacement.
Hypocalcemia
Hypocalcemia is independently associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
The most common cause of hypocalcemia is hypoalbuminemia (remember to correct for this when calculating total serum values).
Other important causes of hypocalcemia seen in the ED include: Hyperventilation, massive blood transfusion, hydrofluoric acid, and pancreatitis.
Hypocalcemia is defined as a total corrected serum calcium level <8.5 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) or an ionized calcium level <4.4 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L).
Patients with hypocalcemia may present with neuromuscular weakness and cardiac conduction abnormalities.
Symptoms are related to both the absolute calcium level and the rate of decrease.
The neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems are most commonly affected.
The degree of hypocalcemia and the clinical presentation will determine management and disposition.
The mainstay of treatment in symptomatic patients involves calcium supplementation.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Hypercalcemia
Textbook presentation: A 64-y-old patient with a history of lung cancer presents with vomiting and altered mental status. The patient shows dry mucous membranes and is diffusely tender to palpation of muscles and bones. The patient is confused and not answering questions appropriately. ECG shows shortened PR and QT intervals.
Hypercalcemia occurs on a spectrum:
Mild: 10.5-12 mg/dL (2.6-3 mmol/L)
Moderate: 12-14 mg/dL (3-3.5 mmol/L)
Severe (hypercalcemic crisis): 14-16 mg/dL (3.5-4 mmol/L)
Stones, Bones, Groans, Thrones, and Psychiatric Overtones
Renal “stones”: Nephrolithiasis, renal failure
Skeletal “bones”: Bone pain, arthralgia, osteoporosis
Abdominal “groans”: Nausea/vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, pancreatitis
“Thrones”: Polyuria/polydipsia (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), dehydration, constipation
“Psychiatric overtones”: Lethargy, altered mental status, coma, hallucinations
Rarely, patients can develop cardiovascular effects with short QT intervals leading to ventricular dysrhythmias and heart blocks.
Hypocalcemia
Textbook presentation: A 54-y-old female who is recently post-total thyroidectomy presents complaining of a seizure. The patient presents awake and having generalized convulsions. ECG shows a prolonged PR interval and a prolonged QT interval due to a prolonged ST segment.
Hypocalcemia is defined as a total corrected serum calcium level <8.5 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) or an ionized calcium level <4.4 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L).
Trousseau’s sign (ie, carpal spasms after blood pressure cuff inflation to 20 mm Hg above the systolic blood pressure for 3 min).
This is more sensitive (94%) and specific than Chvostek's sign. 
Chvostek's sign (ie, facial or eye muscle twitching after tapping on the facial nerve).
Patients with hypocalcemia can develop cardiovascular effects with a prolonged QT interval, leading to ventricular dysrhythmias, heart blocks, and cardiovascular collapse/cardiac arrest.
Treatment
Hypercalcemia
Management will depend on the degree of symptoms and the level of corrected serum calcium.
IV fluids are a mainstay therapy, since most patients are volume-depleted.
0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus until blood pressure and perfusion normalization
Ensure that the patient is protecting their airway and effectively ventilating.
After correction for a potential hypoperfused state, the patient should be initiated on a saline infusion.
0.9% sodium chloride IV at 200-300 mL/h to maintain a urinary output of 2 L/d 
After adequate hydration, consider administration of calcitonin to further decrease the patient’s calcium level.
Calcitonin 4 IU/kg IM or SC q12h
In patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, bisphosphonates should be considered after fluid resuscitation.
Zoledronic acid 4 mg IV over 15 min or
Pamidronate 60-90 mg IV over 2-24 h
Consider corticosteroids in consultation with the patient’s primary physician or oncologist.
Prednisone 60 mg PO qD
A consultation with Nephrology for hemodialysis should be considered in severe cases of hypercalcemia that are refractory to medical management or have cardiac dysfunction (eg, arrhythmia, heart block) or severe neurologic symptoms (eg, coma).
The routine use of furosemide in the management of hypercalcemia is no longer recommended and should be reserved for cases of iatrogenic volume overload states and patients with HF or renal insufficiency.
Hypocalcemia
Management will depend on the degree of symptoms and the level of corrected serum calcium.
Withholding calcium in patients taking digoxin due to increased cardiac sensitivity and the development of arrhythmias is no longer warranted. Administering calcium is no longer contraindicated. 
IV calcium administration is recommended in patients with moderate to severe symptoms (eg, tetany, seizures), cardiovascular involvement (eg, prolonged QT interval), or a corrected total serum calcium level <7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L).
Calcium gluconate 10 mL 10% solution IV (in 50 mL D5 or NS)
Can be given via peripheral IV
93 mg elemental calcium
Calcium chloride 10 mL 10% solution IV (in 50 mL D5 or NS)
Central IV preferred
270 mg elemental calcium
In patients with mild symptoms (eg, paresthesia) and those with a corrected total serum calcium level >7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L), oral calcium administration is preferred.
Calcium carbonate 1 g PO q12h or
Calcium citrate 1 g PO q12h
Be sure to correct for possible concomitant hypomagnesemia (See Chapter: Disorders of Magnesium).
Disposition
Hypercalcemia
Disposition of patients with hypercalcemia will primarily depend on their corrected serum calcium level and symptoms.
Patients without symptoms and calcium levels <12 mg/dL can typically be safely discharged with close follow-up.
Patients with mild symptoms and calcium levels of 12-14 mg/dL may be discharged after hydration if their symptoms are well-managed and they have no cardiac/neurologic disturbance, normal renal function, and the cause is not due to malignancy.
Otherwise, admission may be required.
In patients with malignancy, consultation with Oncology is recommended.
Patients with severe symptoms or calcium levels >14 mg/dL will likely require admission for further management.
Consider admission to a higher level of care in patients with evidence of cardiac/neurologic disturbance.
Hypocalcemia
Disposition of patients with hypocalcemia will primarily depend on their corrected serum calcium level and symptoms.
Patients without symptoms can typically be safely discharged with close follow-up.
Patients who receive IV calcium, have persistent symptoms, or have any evidence of cardiac involvement should be admitted for further cardiac monitoring and treatment of symptoms.
Consider admission to a higher level of care in patients with evidence of cardiac disturbance.

Background
Epidemiology
Hypercalcemia
The prevalence of hypercalcemia in the general population is approximately 1%-2%.
Recent literature indicates that the prevalence of hypercalcemia in patients admitted to the hospital is around 4.7%. 
In patients with malignancy, the lifetime prevalence of hypercalcemia can be >30%, with rates depending on the specific cancer diagnosis. 
In the U.S. and Europe, primary tumors of the lung/breast and multiple myeloma are the most common malignancies associated with hypercalcemia.
Pediatric cancer patients have a lower risk of developing hypercalcemia, with a prevalence up to 1.3%. 
In-hospital mortality rates in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy are around 6.8% (Wright, 2015), with an overall 30-d mortality rate of around 50% in hospitalized cancer patients with hypercalcemia. 
Hypocalcemia
Hypocalcemia was previously estimated to occur in 18% of all hospitalized patients and 85% of patients admitted to the ICU. 
However, recent literature from Italy reports the prevalence of hypocalcemia in patients admitted to the hospital to be around 27.7%. 
Hypocalcemia (calcium levels <7.5 mg/dL [1.9 mmol/L]) is associated with an increased risk of long-term mortality in hospitalized patients. 
Hypocalcemia is independently associated with increased mortality in patients with HF and CKD. 
Pathophysiology
Hypercalcemia
Approximately ½ of the body’s extracellular calcium is ionized, whereas the other ½ is bound to protein (the majority of which is bound to albumin) or as inorganic anions. 
The body maintains serum calcium levels through the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) on the bone, kidney, and gastrointestinal system.
PTH induces the bone and kidneys to increase serum calcium levels. Vitamin D facilitates intestinal calcium absorption, whereas elevated calcium levels inhibit parathyroid hormone release.
Hypercalcemia is associated with 2 main causes accounting for approximately 80%-90% of all cases: (1) Primary hyperparathyroidism and (2) hypercalcemia of malignancy. 
In hospitalized patients, malignancy is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia, whereas primary hyperparathyroidism is a more common cause in the general population. 
Other important causes of hypercalcemia include: Dehydration, pharmacologic agents (thiazide diuretics, Vitamin D, lithium, milk-alkali syndrome), granulomatous disease (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis), prolonged immobilization, and rhabdomyolysis.
Hypocalcemia

The body maintains serum calcium levels through the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) on the bone, kidney, and gastrointestinal system.
PTH induces the bone and kidneys to increase serum calcium levels. Vitamin D facilitates intestinal calcium absorption, whereas elevated calcium levels inhibit parathyroid hormone release.
Hypocalcemia is primarily caused by hypoalbuminemia (typically caused by chronic malnourished states [eg, alcoholism]).
Remember to correct for this when calculating total serum values.
Other important causes of hypocalcemia include: Iatrogenic (eg, massive blood transfusions), hypoparathyroidism (eg, removed during thyroidectomy [up to 3% of procedures] or an autoimmune condition), toxins (eg, hydrofluoric acid), hyperventilation (leading to respiratory alkalosis), vitamin D deficiency (eg, decreased dietary intake or decreased ultraviolet light exposure), CKD (leading to decreased vitamin D production), hyperphosphatemia (eg, due to CKD or increased ingestion/enema), severe pancreatitis (caused by the precipitation of calcium soaps), sepsis (eg, hypoalbuminemia or decreased PTH), and hypomagnesemia (which can cause decreased PTH and PTH resistance).
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Hypercalcemia
The clinical presentation of hypercalcemia is often non-specific or asymptomatic.
Symptom severity will depend on the degree of hypercalcemia, rapidity of onset, and baseline neurologic and renal functions.
Classic symptoms related to hypercalcemia include:
Renal “stones”: Nephrolithiasis, renal failure
Skeletal “bones”: Bone pain, arthralgia, osteoporosis
Abdominal “groans”: Nausea/vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, pancreatitis
“Thrones”: Polyuria/polydipsia (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), dehydration, constipation
“Psychiatric overtones”: Lethargy, altered mental status, coma, hallucinations
Rarely, patients can develop cardiovascular effects with short QT intervals, leading to ventricular dysrhythmias and heart blocks.
ECG typically shows a shortened QT interval.
Hypocalcemia
The neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems are the most commonly affected.
Symptom severity will depend on the degree of hypocalcemia, rapidity of onset, and baseline cardiovascular, neurologic, and renal functions.
Patients with mildly decreased calcium and/or chronic development will typically have milder symptoms or may be asymptomatic.
Patients with significantly decreased calcium and/or acute development will typically present with more severe symptoms.
Hypocalcemia is defined as a total corrected serum calcium <8.5 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) or an ionized calcium level <4.4 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L).
Classic symptoms related to hypocalcemia include “CATs go Numb”:
Convulsions
Arrhythmias
Tetany (initially in the hands)
Numbness/paresthesia (in the hands, feet, and periorally)
Patients can exhibit Trousseau’s sign (ie, carpal spasms after blood pressure cuff inflation to 20 mm Hg above the systolic blood pressure for 3 min), which is due to increased excitability caused by local ulnar and median nerve ischemia.
This finding is more sensitive (94%) and specific than Chvostek's sign. 
Chvostek's sign (ie, facial or eye muscle twitching after tapping on the facial nerve) is not as reliable, and therefore less clinically diagnostic than Trousseau’s sign. 
Patients with hypocalcemia can develop cardiovascular effects with a prolonged QT interval (specifically caused by a prolonged ST segment), leading to ventricular dysrhythmias (eg, torsade de pointes), heart blocks, and cardiovascular collapse/cardiac arrest.
Radiographic Evaluation
Hypercalcemia
Unless the cause of hypercalcemia is known, patients should receive a chest X-ray to rule out granulomatous disease or lung cancer.
Laboratory Evaluation
Hypercalcemia
Standard lab evaluation should include the total serum calcium and ionized calcium levels Table.
An albumin level should be obtained to provide a more accurate evaluation of the calcium level.
https://www.mdcalc.com/calcium-correction-hypoalbuminemia.
A BMP with magnesium and phosphorus should be obtained to check for other electrolyte derangements or acute renal insufficiency, which should be addressed.
Unless the cause of hypercalcemia is known, a PTH level should be obtained to rule-out hyperparathyroidism.
If PTH is significantly elevated, the likely cause is primary hyperparathyroidism.
If the PTH level is normal and there is no evidence of malignancy, serum levels of vitamin D metabolites should be obtained to rule-out exogenous vitamin D supplementation or granulomatous disease as the cause. 
A lipase level should be obtained in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain when considering the diagnosis of pancreatitis (which is associated with hypercalcemia).

Unless the cause of hypocalcemia is known, a PTH level should be obtained to rule-out hypoparathyroidism.
A low PTH level likely contributes to, or is the cause of, the presentation.
Vitamin D metabolites can be obtained after admission or on an outpatient basis to rule-out vitamin D deficiency as the cause.
A lipase level should be obtained in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain when considering the diagnosis of pancreatitis (which is associated with hypocalcemia).
ECG Findings
Hypercalcemia
Consider obtaining a 12-lead ECG to assess the rate, rhythm, intervals, and ST segments.
Short QT interval (which can lead to ventricular dysrhythmias)
Due to the short QT interval, the beginning of the T-wave can fuse to the end of the QRS complex, producing the appearance of ST-segment elevation, thus mimicking STEMI.
Sinus bradycardia, bundle branch block, high-degree AV block
Hypocalcemia
Consider obtaining a 12-lead ECG to assess the rate, rhythm, intervals, and ST segments.
Prolonged QT interval (specifically due to a prolonged ST segment, which can lead to ventricular dysrhythmias
Heart blocks and dysrhythmias
Therapeutic Considerations
Hypercalcemia
Patients with significantly elevated hypercalcemia will typically be hypovolemic and will require fluid resuscitation with a 0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus until blood pressure and perfusion are normalized.
Patients with significantly elevated hypercalcemia can present in a comatose state, lethargic, or with altered mental status, and as such, it is important for clinicians to ensure their patient is protecting their airway and effectively ventilating.
After correction of a possible volume-depleted state, patients should be initiated on a saline infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride IV at 200-300 mL/h to maintain a urinary output of 2 L/d. 
After adequate hydration, consider the administration of calcitonin to further decrease calcium levels (through the augmentation of calcium excretion and inhibition of bone resorption), with a reasonable initial dose of calcitonin 4 IU/kg IM or SC, then q12h if needed.
In patients with a hypercalcemic crisis (particularly those with hypercalcemia of malignancy), bisphosphonates should be considered after fluid resuscitation. Consider the following options: Zoledronic acid 4 mg IV over 15 min or pamidronate 60-90 mg IV over 2-24 h.
Consider corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 60 mg PO qD) in patients with steroid-responsive tumors (eg, lymphoma and multiple myeloma) in consultation with the patient’s primary physician or oncologist. 
Consider denosumab 120 mg SC (initial dose) (a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, preventing osteoclast activation) in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy who are refractory to fluids and bisphosphonate therapy. 
A consultation with Nephrology for hemodialysis should be considered in severe cases of hypercalcemia that are refractory to medical management or have cardiac dysfunction (eg, arrhythmia, heart block) or severe neurologic symptoms (eg, coma).
The routine use of furosemide in the management of hypercalcemia is no longer recommended and should be reserved for cases of iatrogenic volume overload states and patients with HF or renal insufficiency.
Hypocalcemia
Management will depend on the degree of symptoms and the level of corrected serum calcium.
IV calcium administration is recommended in patients with moderate to severe symptoms (eg, tetany, seizures), cardiovascular involvement (eg, prolonged QT interval), or a corrected total serum calcium level <7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L).
In patients with mild symptoms (eg, paresthesias) and a corrected total serum calcium level >7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L), oral calcium administration is preferred.
Be sure to correct for possible concomitant hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia often occurs in concert with hypocalcemia, and the clinical symptoms of the two disorders are indistinguishable.
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
Hypercalcemia
After patients are successfully managed in the ED, attempts should be made to determine the underlying cause of hypercalcemia.
Underlying cancer (obtain a chest X-ray and detailed cancer history)
Referral to Oncology for further work-up
Primary hyperparathyroidism (obtain a PTH level)
Referral to Surgery for urgent parathyroidectomy
Review medication list (eg, vitamin D, lithium, thiazide diuretics)
Removal of offending agents
Hypocalcemia
After patients are successfully managed in the ED, attempts should be made to determine the underlying cause of hypocalcemia.
Hypoparathyroidism or vitamin D deficiency.
Send PTH and vitamin D metabolites.
Patients receiving IV calcium or those who are still symptomatic should be admitted for further management.
Prevention
Hypercalcemia
Prevention will focus on the cause of hypercalcemia.
In patients taking medications causing hypercalcemia, prevention will involve avoiding these offending agents.
In cancer patients, prevention will aim to inhibit the cancer spread and initiate bisphosphonate therapy or denosumab.
Hypocalcemia
Prevention will focus on the cause of hypocalcemia.
In patients with vitamin D deficiency, prevention will be accomplished through vitamin supplementation.
In patients with chronic malnutrition leading to hypoalbuminemia, referral to a dietician should be considered.
In patients with hypoparathyroidism, referral to Endocrinology should be considered.",Disorders of Calcium

Approach to the Critical Patient
AIRWAY/BREATHING/CIRCULATION
Syphilis
DISABILITY
If there is any concern for ocular syphilis, a thorough eye exam must be performed, and patients should be referred to Ophthalmology for close follow-up.
All patients diagnosed with syphilis should have a full neurologic exam to assess for signs of neurosyphilis.
If there is concern that a patient’s neurologic symptoms may be due to neurosyphilis, a lumbar puncture should be performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies.
Consider neurosyphilis in patients presenting with new seizures without a clear cause, particularly if patients have risk factors for syphilis.
Follow standard initial resuscitation for seizures, including managing the airway.
If there is high suspicion that seizures are caused by neurosyphilis, treat patient presumptively with aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18-24 million units daily as 3-4 million units intravenous (IV) q4h or via continuous infusion for 10-14 d.
EXPOSURE
New anogenital lesions should be tested for syphilis, as syphilis often mimics other diseases.
Key Concepts
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum.
If untreated, syphilis can become chronic, causing systemic issues years after the initial infection.
Maintain a high suspicion for disease, particularly in men who have sex with men, patients who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), patients on PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis), transgender patients, and sex workers.
Treatment is often presumptive, based on history, exam, and the most advanced stage of infection.
Neurosyphilis may occur at any stage of the disease; thus, a thorough neurologic exam must be completed in any patient diagnosed with syphilis, as the treatment regimen is different in this case.
Testing involves a multi-step approach using nontreponemal and treponemal testing, and nontreponemal titers should be followed to test for adequate treatment or reinfection.
Diagnosis
Staging
The inoculation phase of syphilis lasts up to 90 days after infection.
Average time of 3 weeks
Primary syphilis is defined by an ulcerative stage.
Lesions will first occur at the site of inoculation, commonly on the penis, labia, fourchette, and anus. Photo
A single painless, indurated, ulceration of 1-2 cm with sharp demarcations is the classic presentation; however, this presentation is observed for only 42.7%. 
Patients with HIV or in other immunocompromised states are more likely to have multiple lesions.
PITFALLS
Primary lesions are often missed by the individual, as they may be painless and in locations that are difficult to examine. Photo
Primary lesions generally resolve within 6 weeks.
Differential diagnosis for primary syphilitic lesions:
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions
Fixed-drug eruptions
Chancroid
Bechet’s disease
Other dermatologic conditions
Secondary syphilis represents a systemic infection.
Symptoms appear 4-8 weeks after the first ulcer.
Classic presentation is a diffuse rash that includes the palms and soles, but can include various systemic findings. Photo
Dermatologic findings also include alopecia, wart-like growths, and mucous membrane lesions.
Misdiagnoses often occur because a thorough sexual history is not obtained.
Nonspecific systemic symptoms such as fever, myalgias, headache, and fatigue are common.
Musculoskeletal symptoms include arthralgias, arthritis, and periostitis.
Gastrointestinal findings can include hepatitis, which is usually asymptomatic, as well as the rare finding of gastric syphilis. 
Renal findings include nephrotic syndrome and glomerulonephritis.
If untreated, these signs and symptoms resolve on their own within a few weeks; however, these signs can recur, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The latent stage of syphilis may last for decades and is defined as a symptom-free period with reduced infectivity.
PITFALLS
The disease can still be passed from mother to fetus during the latent phase.
Tertiary syphilis results from chronic inflammation due to untreated infection.
Rare in modern medicine, this condition occurs years, usually more than a decade, after the initial inoculation.
One third of untreated individuals will develop symptoms of tertiary syphilis. 
Cardiovascular effects include aortic aneurysm, aortic insufficiency, coronary artery disease, and myocarditis.
Gummas are reactive granulomatous masses that occur in any part of the skin, viscera, bone, or soft tissue.
Neurologic symptoms include tabes dorsalis, paresis, and gummatous disease of the spinal cord or brain.
Neurosyphilis
PEARLS
Neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of disease.
Tabes dorsalis occurs as part of tertiary syphilis and is a sequela of chronic inflammation of nerve roots in the posterior columns and spinal nerve roots.
Results in severe radicular pain, ataxia, impaired vibratory senses, and loss of reflexes.
Can present with a wide variety of symptoms, including: 
Seizures
Weakness
Paresis
Stroke symptoms
Cognitive impairment
Confusion
Amnesia
Delusions
Even with adequate treatment, symptoms may not reverse.
Otic syphilis 
Can occur at any stage of infection, caused by inflammation of cranial nerve VIII
Presents with sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo
If untreated, can result in permanent deafness
Ocular syphilis 
Condition can occur at any stage of infection and is caused by inflammation to any eye structure.
PEARLS
Common manifestations include posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis, panuveitis, optic neuropathy, and retinal vasculitis.
If untreated, ocular syphilis can cause vision loss or blindness.
If there is concern for ocular syphilis, a thorough ophthalmologic exam and close follow-up with Ophthalmology are required.
Diagnostic Testing
PEARLS
Testing may be negative during the first 1-4 weeks after inoculation, as treponemal antibodies develop. 
Testing is a multi-step process, requiring both treponemal and nontreponemal tests.
Nontreponemal testing
Types:
Rapid plasma reagin
Venereal disease research laboratory
Provides qualitative and quantitative results
First screening test to diagnose new infection
Follow titers to monitor for effective treatment
May become negative following treatment
Treponemal testing
Types:
Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption
T. Pallidum particle agglutination
T. Pallidum enzyme immunoassay
Generally performed after positive nontreponemal testing
More specific than nontreponemal testing, but only quantitative results
Remains positive following treatment
PEARLS
Nontreponemal testing is typically performed first. If this test is positive, a treponemal test is then performed. If both tests are positive, a patient is considered syphilis-positive.
PITFALLS
False-positive tests do occur, particularly in individuals with autoimmune disease or other chronic infections.
False-negative tests are more likely during the latent period or incubation period.
PEARLS
All sexually active patients with anogenital lesions or high-risk behaviors, as well as all pregnant women, should be tested for syphilis. 
Treatment
Treatment recommendations for various stages of syphilis Table
Treatment regimen is determined by the most advanced stage of infection.
PEARLS
Suspected, incubating, primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis:

Pregnant women with syphilis should be treated with penicillin based on their stage of infection.
Non-penicillin treatments should not be used in pregnancy.
Disposition
Admission
Patients with neurosyphilis require admission for IV antibiotics.
Patients with tertiary syphilis need close consultation with an infectious disease specialist and often require initial inpatient treatment.
Discharge
Patients with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis can be discharged after treatment, but need follow-up with primary care or referral to the health department.
Patients with late latent syphilis can be discharged, but will need arrangements for serial injections of penicillin.
Charting Pearls
Document thorough neurologic and skin exams.
Discuss need for all partners to be treated and for patients to refrain from high-risk sexual behaviors.",Syphilis

Background
Epidemiology
Syphilis rates are rising in the United States.
Between 2017 and 2018, there was a 13.3% increase in all reported cases of syphilis.
The majority of new cases (64.4%) are being diagnosed in men who have sex with men.
New infection rates are 4.7 times higher in black Americans than in white Americans.
Rates of coinfection with HIV are high, particularly among men who have sex with men.
In men who have sex with men and who are diagnosed with syphilis, 41.6% of cases have either previously diagnosed or newly diagnosed HIV.
As syphilis rates have risen in recent years, congenital syphilis rates have also risen.
In 2018, there were 33.1 cases per 100,000 births, a substantial increase from 8.4 per 100,00 in 2012. 
Pathophysiology
In adults, syphilis is transmitted through sexual contact via mucous membrane exposure or through needle sharing.
During the incubation period, serum testing will be negative, and individuals are not considered infectious.
The incubation phase is long, up to 90 days, because T. pallidum is a slowly growing spirochete that cannot be cultured.
Congenital syphilis can be transmitted across the placenta from mother to fetus or through infant contact with maternal lesions. 
There is a low likelihood of transmission to others during the late latent phase. 
After the primary and secondary stages, the host immune system can resolve the lesions, but cannot fully eliminate the spirochete infection, causing a latent infection that results in chronic inflammation throughout the body.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Regional, painless, bilateral lymphadenopathy is common.
All new anogenital lesions should be tested for syphilis, as they can easily be mistaken for other diseases.
Condyloma lata are anogenital warts associated with secondary syphilis that may be confused with human-papillomavirus-associated condyloma accuminata. Photo Many exam findings are subtle and can be difficult to observe for both patients and clinicians. A thorough physical exam is needed for disease identification and staging.
Neurosyphilis
CSF studies will be abnormal in neurosyphilis. 
Typical abnormalities include:
Elevated protein levels
Pleocytosis
Positive venereal disease research laboratory or rapid plasma reagin testing.
Neurosyphilis may present with epileptic seizures without a clear cause that can be very difficult to control.
Patients presenting with seizures often have poor outcomes secondary to delayed diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease. 
Treatment for seizures due to neurosyphilis is the same as that for seizures of other causes.
Congenital Syphilis
Risk factors for congenital syphilis: 
Inadequate prenatal care, particularly prenatal care that started late
Mother in asymptomatic inoculation or early latent stages
Mother’s syphilis treatment completed less than 30 days prior to delivery
Lack of prenatal care or late prenatal care is a factor in 67% of congenital syphilis cases. 
Prior treatment is considered inadequate if delivery occurs within 30 days of treatment completion, if signs of congenital syphilis are present at delivery, or if the maternal antibody titer is more than four times higher than the pretreatment titer. 
Up to 40% of fetuses with congenital syphilis will result in a stillbirth or miscarriage. 
Among live born infants with congenital syphilis, 60-90% are asymptomatic at birth. 
Screening should be performed for any infant with concern for congenital syphilis, and the threshold to treat should be low.
Infants born with congenital syphilis are at risk of: 
Stillbirth or miscarriage
Newborn death
Neurological complications
Hepatomegaly
Ascites
Splenomegaly
Visual loss
Hearing loss
Bone and teeth deformities
Hutchinson’s triad: Classic triad of congenital syphilis:
Interstitial keratitis causing vision loss
Deafness secondary to cranial nerve VIII damage
Notched central incisors
Untreated neonates can develop neurosyphilis in both early and late stages of the disease course, with signs and symptoms including meningitis, seizures, and hydrocephalus.
If untreated, these conditions can lead to significant neurodevelopmental delay.
AdditionalConsiderations
Obtain a thorough history using gender-neutral non-judgmental language to assess a patient’s risk of infection in terms of number of sexual partners, partner gender, safe sex practices, and HIV risk.
Latent syphilis is defined as early or late depending on the time from initial infection, but patients may not be able to identify when the infection occurred.
Early latent syphilis is defined as being contracted within the last 12 months.
Late syphilis is defined as being contracted more than 12 months prior.
Rapid plasma reagin and venereal disease research laboratory titer levels cannot be compared.
Treponemal testing is usually performed as a second step because its greater specificity increases the likelihood of false positives.
Among healthy patients, 1-2% will have false-positive tests, with treponemal testing having a slightly higher false-positive rate than nontreponemal testing. 
False-positive results are more likely in individuals with:
Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or HIV
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
HSV
Pregnancy
Other spirochete infections
Older age
Other underlying conditions
Lesion-based testing exists, but is not readily available. 
Dark-field microscopy of lesions can be performed but usually requires consultation with state or local health department.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for T. pallidum exudate from lesions is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Direct fluorescent antibody testing of lesion exudate is not available in the United States.
Therapeutic Considerations
When choosing a treatment regimen, serious consideration should be given to patient compliance, as significant long-term health risks arise from incompletely treated infections.
IM benzathine penicillin is preferred to oral treatment regimens if there is concern for compliance, as oral regimens require multiple doses per day.
Patients should be referred for follow-up serologic testing to ensure adequate treatment of disease.
Recurrent Syphilis and Failed Treatment
Identifying recurrent infection or failed treatment can be challenging. Following nontreponemal titers is the preferred method for monitoring treatment success. 
Titers should decrease by four-fold within 6-12 months of therapy for treatment to be considered adequate.
No additional treatment is needed if titers are declining or unchanged.
If titers increase for two or more weeks, consider treatment failure or recurrent infection. 
Penicillin Allergy
In patients with documented penicillin allergies, special considerations may be needed in treatment, particularly for those with documented severe or anaphylactic reactions. 
In suspected, primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis, alternative non-penicillin treatment regimens can be used. Table
If penicillin is being used, skin testing is recommended to identify patients with a high risk of IgE-mediated responses, which occur in 5-15% of documented penicillin allergies. 
Skin testing identifies 90-99% of those who will have more severe IgE-mediated responses, but some patients with a negative skin test may still have severe reactions. 
If patients have a documented penicillin allergy and negative skin testing, an observed penicillin challenge should be attempted.
For cases in which skin testing is not available, benzylpenicilloyl poly-L-lysine (PrePen) and penicillin G should be administered in an observed setting.
If there is any reaction, patients should undergo desensitization.
Penicillin should be avoided in patients with a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hemolytic anemia, or interstitial nephritis.
A prior autoimmune deregulatory response puts patients at a higher risk of severe and potentially deadly reactions.
Penicillin must be used in the treatment of neurosyphilis, pregnant women, and congenital syphilis.
If penicillin must be used in a patient for which there is high concern for potential severe reaction based on history and/or skin testing, penicillin desensitization will be needed in addition to consultation with an infectious disease specialist.
Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction
This systemic reaction is caused by the release of endotoxins, lipoproteins, and cytokines as spirochetes die.
Symptoms include dermatologic symptoms, fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, and nausea and vomiting.
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is often confused with an allergic reaction.
Reaction occurs in 30-50% of patients. 
Usually occurs within 2-8 hours after treatment, but the reaction can occur anytime within the first 24 hours. 
If treated during the secondary phase, the dermatologic rash may worsen.
Treatment is supportive and involves antihistamines and antipyretics.
In pregnant women treated during the second half of pregnancy, there is an increased risk of premature labor. 
Pregnant women undergoing treatment should have close follow-up or observation with obstetrics.
Prevention
Prevention of disease is paramount. Safe sexual practices should be discussed with all at-risk patients.
Patients with known syphilis exposure should be tested.
Treat patients presumptively for disease if their exposure occurred within the last 90 days. 
Regular screening of patients who are high-risk for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, even if asymptomatic, is a United States Preventive Services Task Force Grade A recommendation. 
In most areas, syphilis is a reportable disease. Follow local and state guidelines.
Individuals with new infections should be encouraged to inform any sexual partners or needle-sharing partners.
All individuals diagnosed with syphilis should be tested for HIV.
Screening of all pregnant women for syphilis is a United States Preventive Services Task Force Grade A recommendation. ",Syphilis

The initial presentation of life-threatening tick-borne illness can be very non-specific and easily confused with non-specific viral illnesses, such as gastroenteritis and influenza.
The presence of a rash in patients who have visited endemic areas must raise the suspicion for tick-borne illness and prompt consideration for empiric treatment.
Audio Board Review EM:RAP Audio
Key Concepts
Ticks may carry a variety of pathogens that can cause disease in humans, including Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, Colorado tick fever, southern tick-associated rash illness, and tick paralysis. 
A clear history of tick bite may not always be available, so tick-borne illnesses should be considered in patients with concerning symptoms who live in or who have been to an endemic area.
Early signs and symptoms can be non-specific.
Many tick-borne diseases present with headache, fever/chills, myalgias, and a distinctive rash.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation: Patient who was recently camping presents with fever, myalgias, nausea, arthralgias, and a rash.
Less than 50% of patients present with a history of a tick bite. 
Most cases of RMSF are misdiagnosed at the initial medical visit. 
Patients with tick-borne diseases often have non-specific complaints (fever, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, rash), which can make diagnosis difficult.
Only approximately 30% of children with RMSF and ehrlichiosis have a history of exposure to wooded areas. 
Tick paralysis presents distinctly from other tick-borne illnesses; rather than fever, myalgias, and rash, patients present with paralysis and have a tick attached upon physical exam.
Most tick-borne infections occur between April and October, but as many as 9% of cases can occur during the winter months. 
A classic erythema migrans rash Photo upon exam can be diagnostic for early localized Lyme disease; if this rash is present, no further testing is required. 
RMSF can present as macules on the palms, soles, wrists, forearms, and ankles that then spread toward the center of the body. These lesions can become petechial or purpuric. 
Not all patients with RMSF develop a rash (studies report 68-95% with rash),  and not all will become petechial. 
For patients with a rash, note the original location, appearance, and progression of the rash.
Diagnostic testing for tick-borne diseases may require several days to receive the results, whereas the decision to treat must often be made clinically. (See: Diagnostic Considerations)
Treatment
If a tick is found, remove with forceps by grasping the head and pulling straight out, without leaving pieces of the tick in the patient.
Prophylaxis for disease following a tick bite is controversial; some recommend treatment within 72 h if the tick is engorged and the patient has visited a Lyme-endemic area by administering a single dose of 200 mg of oral doxycycline to prevent Lyme disease. 
Tick paralysis resolves with tick removal.
Most tick-borne rickettsial diseases can be treated with doxycycline, regardless of age, and tooth staining does not occur with short courses. 
Stabilize the patient with IVF and fever control. If there is concern for RMSF, consider also treating for Neisseria meningitidis.
It is important to counsel patients on the prevention of tick-borne diseases, including checking for ticks after potential exposure, bathing within 2 h of being outdoors, wearing protective clothing, and using a tick repellent.

Background
The number of tick-borne infections doubled in the U.S. from 2014 to 2016 and continues to rise. 
Lyme disease
Photo
Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in North America.
This disease is caused by the Borrelia spirochete and is transmitted by the Ixodes deer tick. 
These ticks are found throughout the U.S.
Although 30,000 cases are reported to the CDC yearly, it is estimated that 300,000 people may be infected with Lyme disease in the U.S. each year. 
Transmission occurs after ticks have fed for more than 24 h. 
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is a systemic, small vessel vasculitis caused by Rickettsia rickettsii and is transmitted by various types of ticks including the Dermacentor tick. 
RMSF has been reported in all states. 
More than 4,000 cases of RMSF were reported in 2016 in the U.S., with a reported fatality of 0.5% according to surveillance data. However, in clinical reviews, 5-10% of cases are fatal. 
Ehrlichiosis
Ehrlichiosis is caused by bacteria transmitted through the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum) and blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis).
This disease is typically found in the Upper Midwest, Southeast, Northeast, and South-Central United States. 
In 2016, a total of 1,377 cases were reported in the U.S. 
Anaplasmosis
Anaplasmosis is caused by a bacterium that lives in granulocytes and causes a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS)-like reaction. 
Anaplasmosis is typically found in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and upper Midwest. 
In 2016, a total of 4,151 cases were reported in the U.S. 
Babesiosis
Babesiosis is a protozoan infection that is transmitted by Ixodes ticks. Photo
This infection can also be transmitted by blood transfusion and perinatally. 
Babesiosis is typically found in the Northeast and upper Midwest. 
In 2016, a total of 1744 cases of babesiosis were reported in the U.S. 
Tularemia
Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis and can be transmitted by inhalation, tick vectors, and other insect and mammalian vectors. 
This disease is found all over North America, although the highest concentration of disease occurs in the Southern and Central regions of the U.S. 
In 2016, 230 cases of tularemia were reported in the U.S. 
Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever
Tick-borne relapsing fever is caused by a Borrelia spirochete and can be transmitted by Ornithodoros ticks. 
This disease is found in states west of the Mississippi River, in mountainous regions, and in log cabins with rodents. 
From 1990-2011, 483 cases were reported in the U.S. 
Colorado Tick Fever
Colorado tick fever is caused by Orbivirus, which is transmitted by D. andersoni ticks. 
This disease is found in the Rocky Mountain region at high altitudes (4,000-10,000 ft). 
Colorado tick fever is very rare. Only 83 cases were reported in the U.S. from 2002-2012. 
Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness
Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) is associated with A. americanum ticks (eg, the Lone Star tick). 
STARI was initially thought to be caused by Borrellia lonestari, but now the cause is unclear. 
This disease is found in the Southeastern and South-Central United States. 
Tick Paralysis
Tick paralysis is caused by several tick species (Dermacentor, Amblyomma, Ixodes), and the associated paralysis is due to a neurotoxin produced in the salivary glands of female ticks. 
Most commonly, tick paralysis is found in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountain area. 
Tick paralysis is not a reportable disease; thus, the data regarding its incidence are unreliable.
Diagnostic Considerations
Lyme Disease
Early localized Lyme disease presents with an erythema migrans (EM) lesion Photo, also known as a target lesion, at the site of the tick bite. This rash has an erythematous papule or patch with central or paracentral clearing. The largest diameter of the lesion is typically 5 cm or greater. The target lesion usually appears 1-2 wk after a bite but can appear up to 30 d afterward. Other symptoms include low-range fever, myalgias, headache, arthralgias, and fatigue. 
Early disseminated Lyme disease occurs if untreated and typically presents as multiple EM lesions. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement including CN VII palsy or meningitis can occur, as well as cardiac complications such as carditis or atrioventricular block. Similar to early localized disease, these patients can also have myalgias, headache, arthralgias, and fatigue. 
Late Lyme disease presents as a monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, with the knee most typically being involved. This condition can develop weeks to months after the initial infection. 
Laboratory tests: ELISA testing followed by immunoblot. If there is concern for neurologic involvement, consider lumbar puncture CSF testing. If concern for joint involvement, consider aspiration of synovial fluid to rule out infection. CSF and synovial fluid alone are non-diagnostic for Lyme without accompanying serum testing. 
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
RMSF symptoms begin days to weeks after the tick bite, and this disease causes a systemic small-vessel vasculitis and coagulopathic state. The classic triad of fever, headache and rash is not present in many cases. The initial presentation can be confused with gastroenteritis or other intra-abdominal infections with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 
RMSF can have eye involvement with iritis, uveitis, retinal inflammation, and optic disc edema. 
The rash typically presents after 3 days of illness and starts as red papules/macules on the wrists/extremities that move centrally on the body and become petechial and purpuric. Photo 
Late presentations can include CNS findings such as altered mental status, meningismus, and seizures. 
Late presentations can also present with cardiac involvement including myocarditis, arrhythmias, and shock. 
Laboratory tests: Patients can have hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated AST. RMSF-specific testing includes PCR of blood (preferred), serum antibody testing (develops 7-10 d after illness), or ELISA. PCR has a high false negative rate. 
Ehrlichiosis
Ehrlichiosis typically presents with non-specific early symptoms 5-10 d after the tick bite, appearing similar to a viral illness with fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and malaise. 
Patients can also have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy. 
Two-thirds of patients will have a rash, which is typically nonspecific maculopapular. 
Patients can also have conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, oral/genital ulcers, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurologic symptoms. 
Severe cases can present as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with uncontrolled immune system activation. 
As many as 25% can require ICU-level care. 
Laboratory tests: Pancytopenia, elevated AST, hyponatremia. Disease-specific testing includes DNA PCR testing and serum antibody testing. 
Anaplasmosis
Anaplasmosis can be difficult to distinguish from ehrlichiosis, with patients typically presenting with fever, headache, and myalgias. 
A rash is less common than in other tick-borne illnesses; neurologic symptoms are rare, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain can occur in as many as 50% of patients. 
More severe cases can resemble macrophage activation syndrome with elevated ferritin, triglyceride, and interleukin levels. 
Laboratory tests: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated AST. Disease-specific testing includes DNA PCR testing and serum antibody testing. 
Babesiosis
Symptoms present 1-4 wk after the tick bite or up to 6 mo after exposure from transfusion. 
Symptoms include high fevers, malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, cough, anorexia, and less commonly abdominal pain, emotional lability, conjunctival injection, and vomiting. 
Patients can have a pulse-temperature dissociation (eg, relative bradycardia with fever). 
Hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and retinopathy may be noted upon exam.
Severe babesiosis can cause splenic infarcts, hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and organ failure. 
Laboratory tests: Giemsa staining with parasite in RBCs resembling a “Maltese cross”, and signs of hemolysis on blood smear. Disease-specific PCR testing is also available. 
Tularemia
After a 3-5 d incubation period, patients typically develop a papule at the site of the tick bite, which can become pustular and ulcerated with regional lymphadenopathy. 
Systemic symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, and fatigue with a pulse-temperature dissociation. 
Rarely, patients can develop ocular manifestations and lung and cardiac manifestations. 
Laboratory tests: Serum antibody testing. 
Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever
Tick-borne relapsing fever typically presents with high fever (>40°C [104°F]). Symptoms present within 1 wk of exposure, and fever can resolve after 3 d and then return after another 1 wk, in some cases repeating in multiple cycles. 
The associated symptoms include arthralgias, myalgias, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. 
Iritis, conjunctivitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and maculopapular rash have also been described as symptoms. 
Severe cases can cause neurologic, cardiac, and pulmonary symptoms. 
Laboratory tests: Spirochetes in Wright or Giemsa stain of a peripheral blood smear. 
Colorado Tick Fever
Colorado tick fever typically presents within 2 wk after the tick bite with non-specific symptoms such as fever, photophobia, headache, maculopapular rash, conjunctival injection, and vomiting. 
50% of cases are biphasic, in which symptoms resolve and then return. 
Rarely, this disease can present with CNS symptoms as well as hemorrhagic fever. 
Laboratory tests: Leukopenia, PCR testing, serum antibody testing. 
Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness
STARI presents with a circular rash similar to erythema migrans with mild constitutional symptoms such as headache, fatigue, fever, and muscle pains. 
There are no specific laboratory tests for STARI.
Tick Paralysis
There are limited data on tick paralysis, but studies suggest the toxin may affect acetylcholine release. 
Symptoms can be confused for Guillain-Barré syndrome, botulism, and polio. 
If the tick is not removed, it can lead to respiratory failure with a mortality rate of approximately 10%. 
There are no specific laboratory tests for tick paralysis.
Therapeutic Considerations
Lyme disease
Doxycycline is typically the recommended treatment and can be used at any age.  The American Academy of Pediatrics supports the use of doxycycline in children <8 y of age if given for <21 d. 
Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime may be used in children, with the selection based on the potential for co-infection, medication allergy, ease of dosing, and ability to avoid sun exposure.
For adults
Doxycycline 100 mg PO q12h for 14-21 d OR cefuroxime axetil 500 mg PO q12h for 14-21 d OR amoxicillin 500 mg PO q8h for 14-21 d.
For children
Amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/day (MAX 500 mg per dose) divided q8h for 14-21 d OR doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg (MAX 100 mg) PO q12h for 14-21 d OR cefuroxime axetil 15 mg/kg (MAX 500 mg) PO q12h for 14-21 d
For facial palsy or Lyme meningitis, doxycycline is preferred as an oral agent; IV ceftriaxone can be used as an alternate parenteral agent.
Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h for 14-28d.
In pregnant patients with Lyme disease, it is recommended to avoid doxycycline. 
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
Patients with suspected RMSF should be treated empirically with a tetracycline, typically doxycycline, because antibody testing will only be positive after 1 wk or more. 
Doxycycline should be used in patients with suspected rickettsial disease regardless of age.
Adults: doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV q12h for minimum of 5-7d
Children (< 45 kg): doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg (MAX 100 mg) PO q12h for minimum of 5-7d
Ehrlichiosis
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice: 
Adults: doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV q12h for minimum of 5-7d
Children (< 45 kg): doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg (MAX 100 mg) PO q12h for minimum of 5-7d
Avoid sulfonamide medications because they have been associated with worse outcomes. 
Anaplasmosis
Mild cases can be self-limiting.
The first-line agent is doxycycline:
Adults: doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV q12h for 10-14d
Children (< 45 kg): doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg (MAX 100 mg) PO q12h for 10-14d
Due to neutrophil dysfunction, patients may require treatment for concurrent bacterial/fungal infection. 
Avoid sulfonamide medications because they have been associated with worse outcomes. 
Babesiosis
In immunocompetent patients, babesiosis is typically self-limiting.
If treatment is required, azithromycin and atovaquone OR clindamycin and quinine are typically recommended. 
Atovaquone 750 mg PO q12h PLUS azithromycin 500 - 1000 mg PO on first day followed by 250 -1000 mg (MAX 1000 mg) PO q24h for 7-10d OR clindamycin 300 - 600 mg IV q6h OR clindamycin 600 mg PO q8h PLUS quinine 650 mg PO q6-8h for 7-10d
Malaise and fatigue can persist for months. 
Asplenic patients may require exchange transfusion or plasmapheresis. 
Tularemia
Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin are the treatment of choice. 
Adults: gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV/IM q24h for minimum of 10d OR doxycycline 100 mg IV/PO q12h for 14-21d OR ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV/PO q12h for 10-14d OR streptomycin 1 g IM q12h for minimum of 10d
Children: gentamicin 2.5 mg/kg IV/IM q8h for minimum of 10d OR ciprofloxacin 15 mg/kg (MAX 1 g per day) IV/PO q12h for 10d OR streptomycin 15 mg/kg IM q12h for minimum of 10d
Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever
For patients without CNS involvement tetracycline is recommended. If tetracycline contraindicated, erythromycin recommended is recommended.
Adults: tetracycline 500 mg PO q6h for 10d OR erythromycin 500 mg PO q6h for 10d
Children: erythromycin 12.5 mg (MAX 500 mg) PO q6h for 10d
For patients with CNS involvement, ceftriaxone is recommended.
Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h for 10-14d
Colorado Tick Fever
Colorado tick fever typically self-resolves in 7-8 d. 
Treatment is supportive. 
Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness
Physicians often treat STARI with doxycycline, although it is unclear whether antibiotic treatment is necessary or beneficial. 
Tick Paralysis
Removal of the tick is the treatment for tick paralysis, and thus a thorough exam is important in all patients with suspected tick paralysis.
Typically, patients will improve within hours of tick removal.
Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is seen in 15% of patients after treatment of Borrelia diseases (eg, Lyme disease or tick-borne relapsing fever) due to cytokine release and the phagocytosis of spirochetes. 
The symptoms are typically fevers, chills, hypotension, flushing, tachycardia. 
Treatment is supportive.",Tick-Borne Diseases

Prehospital notification of an incoming patient with suspected stroke can enable emergency department (ED) staff to streamline workflow and implement parallel processing to expedite timely delivery of care upon arrival.
AIRWAY
All patients with suspected acute stroke should be assessed immediately upon arrival for airway compromise
Patients who are unable to clear oral secretions or maintain airway stability should be immediately intubated.
Standard agents for rapid sequence intubation should be used, and the choice of procedures and ongoing sedative agents should take into consideration blood pressure targets.
BREATHING
All patients with suspected acute stroke should be assessed immediately upon arrival for breathing compromise.
Provide supplemental O2 if O2 saturation is <94%.
CIRCULATION
All patients with suspected acute stroke should be assessed immediately upon arrival for hemodynamic stability.
Obtain peripheral intravenous (IV) access.
Current guidelines recommend blood pressure targets for patients with stroke as follows: Table
Acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA): <220/120 mm Hg
Acute ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator administration: <185/110 mm Hg
Intracerebral hemorrhage: <180/90 mm Hg
Subarachnoid hemorrhage: <140-160/90 mm Hg
DISABILITY
Obtain a point-of-care glucose.
Patients determined to be stable should be taken immediately for neuroimaging after a brief assessment of neurologic deficits.
Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) +/- other modalities. (See: Key Diagnostic Elements)
In patients with suspected ischemic stroke with disabling neurologic deficits of <4.5 h duration, alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) should be considered if non-contrast head CT shows no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage and the patient does not meet additional exclusion criteria.
Reperfusion decisions should be made in conjunction with local protocols and neurology consultation. (See: Treatment)
Position the head in the midline and neutral position and supine as tolerated.
The axiom “time is brain” refers to the time-dependent treatment effect of reperfusion therapies (tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular mechanical thrombectomy) and the fact that, with each passing minute, a stroke progresses from ischemia to infarction, additional neurons are lost, and functional outcomes worsen.
Accordingly, stroke systems of care should be focused on efficient care delivery to maximize the potential benefits of available treatment options.
Hemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral and subarachnoid) portends a worse prognosis and is discussed in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage and Intracerebral Hemorrhage. (See Chapter: Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) (See Chapter: Intracerebral Hemorrhage)

C3 Audio: 2018 January - Stroke - Introduction
Key Concepts
TIA and acute ischemic stroke are medical emergencies that occur as a result of disruption in blood flow to the brain, and originate from a similar pathophysiologic process along the spectrum of acute cerebrovascular syndrome.
Acute cerebrovascular syndrome is suspected in patients who experienced an abrupt onset of focal neurologic deficits, either transient (TIA) or persistent (acute ischemic stroke). Symptoms are typically negative or ablative and associated with the loss of normal neurologic function, as opposed to positive or irritative phenomena, which usually have a non-vascular cause.
The definition of TIA has evolved in recent years from being classically “time-based” to “tissue-based,” emphasizing the importance of early neuroimaging in all patients suspected of having acute cerebrovascular syndrome.
Non-contrast head CT is generally the fastest and most readily available diagnostic imaging modality to start the work-up, differentiating ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke with a high degree of specificity. If the non-contrast head CT is negative for bleeding, if available, CT angiography (CTA) and/or perfusion imaging (should be/can be) added while the patient is in the scanner to exclude large vessel occlusion in patients with significant neurologic deficits who may benefit from endovascular therapy.
PITFALLS
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke but may be falsely negative early in the course of stroke (particularly in the posterior fossa).
For patients with acute localizing neurologic deficits that are disabling, reperfusion therapies are increasingly offered with broader inclusion. The use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is supported within a time period up to 4.5 h from the time last known well in patients with persistent disabling symptoms and without contraindications. Endovascular therapy has shown clinical efficacy in carefully selected patients within the time period up to 24 h from the time last known well, with evidence of anterior large vessel occlusion and a favorable imaging pattern, which is discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.
PITFALLS
The major risk with reperfusion therapy is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Risk/benefit discussions regarding reperfusion decisions should consider the patient’s risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients should be monitored closely for any clinical deterioration that may suggest symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and be treated immediately.
PEARLS
Strict adherence to guideline-driven care, such as care delivered in dedicated multidisciplinary stroke units and beyond to rehabilitation, appears to be the most impactful intervention for improving stroke outcomes.
Optimizing secondary prevention strategies, such as the addition of cholesterol-lowering or anticoagulant medications based on individualized risk factor modification and etiologic-specific treatment, is imperative in all acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients.
Diagnosis
Textbook presentation: An older individual with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation presents with an abrupt onset of right-sided weakness and speech difficulty. The patient was last known well 2 h ago. On examination, right-side face, right arm and right leg hemiplegia, and hemisensory loss are noted, in addition to aphasia and a left-gaze preference. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 23. Table
Prehospital providers should use a validated stroke recognition tool (eg, FAST, CPSS, LAPSS) and also consider using a stroke severity tool (eg, LAMS, CPSSS, FAST-ED, VAN) to aid in routing decisions to endovascular-capable stroke centers. Severity scales can adjust the probability of large vessel occlusion from ~10% to 50%-60%.
Patients with suspected stroke by prehospital screening should be transported to the nearest ED capable of administering tissue plasminogen activator. Although research is ongoing to determine the benefits of bypassing a tissue plasminogen activator-capable facility to reach a thrombectomy-capable facility, the benefits are region-dependent and yet to be proven. 
All patients should have the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale calculated, as it is a widely accepted measure of stroke severity. Generally, this should be performed after initial stabilization and neuroimaging; it is currently a national quality metric.
PITFALLS
Notably, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale is a tool designed for research and is good at revealing the potential for stroke in the anterior circulation but is not as reliable for the posterior circulation.
A point-of-care blood glucose level should be checked early in the care of a suspected stroke patient, as hypoglycemia is a common mimic of stroke-like symptoms.
Non-ischemic mimics account for 25%-30% of suspected stroke diagnoses and include hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, migraine, and syncope, in addition to many other conditions.
PEARLS
A non-contrast head CT should be performed to check for intracerebral hemorrhage, space-occupying lesions, and/or signs of infarction (eg, sulcal effacement, loss of gray-white differentiation, early hypodensity, and hyperdense vessel signs). Image Image Image
CTA is increasingly performed in the acute setting to assess “vessel status” in acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients. Approximately 10% of acute ischemic stroke patients have large vessel occlusion, and 5% of large vessel occlusions presenting within 3 h of the time last known well will have a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score <4.
Imaging biomarkers, such as a perfusion/core mismatch on CT or magnetic resonance perfusion or a diffusion-weighted imaging/T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2FLAIR) mismatch on MRI, have been used as surrogates for timing when the time last known well is unknown, such as those with wake-up symptoms. These are being used at some centers to select additional patients for reperfusion therapies who would have been historically excluded by time last known well limitations.
Reperfusion decisions should take priority over the acquisition of advanced neuroimaging modalities. Once reperfusion decisions have been made, diffusion-weighted MRI is the diagnostic gold standard in acute cerebrovascular syndrome to differentiate TIA from infarction and non-ischemic mimics. Up to 30% of suspected TIA patients with clinical resolution of symptoms will show a rule-in infarction on MRI.
Following reperfusion decisions, acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients should undergo a diagnostic work-up to uncover the underlying etiology. The ASCOD classification system (A: atherosclerosis; S: small vessel disease; C: cardiac pathology; O: other causes D: dissection) identifies these five phenotypes.  Table
Treatment
Alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) is currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved parenteral thrombolytic agent for use in acute ischemic stroke, and its use is endorsed by both the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (Class I, Level A) and American College of Emergency Physicians (Level B recommendation), despite longstanding controversy regarding the robustness of the data supporting its clinical efficacy.
Alteplase should only be administered to patients with disabling neurologic deficits thought to result from an acute ischemic stroke of <4.5 h duration and a CT scan showing no evidence of hemorrhage or other contraindications to treatment.
When administered, alteplase should be given as expeditiously as possible to maximize the potential benefits and minimize harm, and systems-of-care should be designed to eliminate unnecessary treatment delays. The Target: Stroke Phase II Campaign from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association aims to continue to reduce national average alteplase administration times, with current goals being door-to-needle times <60 min in 75% or more, and <45 min in 50% or more of treated patients respectively.
Despite the desire to administer tissue plasminogen activator as quickly as possible, it should not be given without first engaging in a brief discussion of risks and benefits with the patient or surrogate decision-maker, when possible. Shared decision-making between the patient/surrogate and healthcare professional is supported by American College of Emergency Physicians (Level C recommendation).
On the whole, the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after tissue plasminogen activator administration is 4.9%-7.7%. Individualized risk can be predicted somewhat using clinical decision-support tools, such as the iSCORE.  Table
For appropriate patients with large vessel occlusion, endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy has a number needed to treat of 3 for a good functional outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-2) at 90 d. Table
Regional systems-of-care should be designed to triage large vessel occlusion patients to centers capable of endovascular interventions as quickly as possible.
The publication of two recent trials supports the efficacy of endovascular treatment up to 24 h after time last known well in appropriately selected patients with large vessel occlusion. 
PEARLS
Aspirin 325 mg should be administered to acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients who are not receiving thrombolytic therapy, unless otherwise contraindicated. Most patients should be started on a daily antiplatelet agent unless a clear cardioembolic etiology has been identified, in which case anticoagulation is usually preferred.
Optimizing secondary prevention strategies (blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) and addressing modifiable risk factors and lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, Mediterranean diet, exercise, weight loss, and sleep apnea) should be promoted.
Disposition
Discharge
PEARLS
Some acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients thought to have experienced a TIA may be safely discharged if the following criteria are met:
The patient’s symptoms are completely resolved and they have not been stuttering or crescendo-like, suggesting an unstable process.
Neuroimaging is reassuring.
Vessel imaging of the head and neck does not reveal new significant/critical large vessel stenosis or occlusion warranting immediate intervention.
The patient does not have evidence of a clear and unaddressed cardioembolic etiology (such as atrial fibrillation).
Early specialty follow-up (preferably with a vascular neurologist) can be arranged.
Risk stratification scores, such as the ABCD2, ABCD3-I, and Canadian TIA Score, have been developed to help predict a patient’s short-term stroke risk. However, the use of risk scores as a solitary guide to disposition decisions is generally discouraged.
Patients thought to have experienced a subacute ischemic stroke or TIA, who are otherwise optimized from a secondary prevention standpoint and do not meet the criteria for inpatient physical/occupational/speech therapy, may also be considered for discharge in certain circumstances.
ED observation units offering accelerated diagnostic protocol-driven care can be a safe and efficient alternative to hospitalization in patients with TIA.
Rapid access outpatient TIA clinics are another option that have shown an 80% reduction in 90-d stroke occurrence. 
Admission
PEARLS
Almost all acute ischemic stroke patients with persistent neurologic deficits, in addition to high-risk TIA patients, should be hospitalized.
Care delivery in dedicated stroke units and certified stroke centers is associated with improved patient outcomes. 
Patients receiving reperfusion therapies should be admitted to institutions with neurosurgical capabilities in the event of hemorrhagic transformation warranting emergency intervention.
Patients in extremis or with signs of increased intracranial pressure (hydrocephalus, midline shift, altered mental status, seizures) should be cared for in an intensive care unit (preferably one with neurocritical care expertise).",Transient Ischemic Attack and Acute Ischemic Stroke
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
Stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States and a leading cause of long-term disability.  In 2013, 130,000 deaths were attributed to stroke in the United States.
An estimated 795,000 new strokes are diagnosed in the United States each year, of which 87% are ischemic.  The incidence of TIA is 200,000 to 500,000, with a prevalence of 5 million individuals, but is likely under-reported, as up to one-third of patients fail to seek medical attention with the initial event. 
PEARLS
A stroke is preceded by a TIA in 12%-30% of patients, and the risk is highest in the first 24 h.  Up to 11% of TIA patients will experience a subsequent disabling ischemic stroke within the ensuing 90 d, and in 50% of these patients it will occur within the first 48 h.  In one study, the stroke risk within 48 h of an ED visit for TIA was 4.8%. 
Stroke occurs more commonly in men than in women, but women experience more severe strokes and have worse outcomes. 
Although the incidence of stroke in the United States is decreasing overall, the population-attributable risk reduction is occurring disproportionately among Caucasian and not black Americans. 
TIA and stroke are more common in lower-income individuals and those with fewer years of education. 
Worldwide, 10.3 million new strokes occur each year, and 75% of deaths attributed to stroke occur in low- and middle-income countries.  Overall, 90% of strokes worldwide occur in the setting of potentially modifiable risk factors. 
The estimated global lifetime risk of stroke after the age of 25 y is approximately 25%. 
Pathophysiology
TIA and stroke share the same list of causes, and are most commonly a result of thrombotic or embolic complications of atherothrombotic disease. 
Stroke symptoms occur as a result of a focal area of neuronal hypoperfusion, leading to oligemia, impaired oxygen and glucose metabolism, and eventual ischemia and infarction. Progression along the acute cerebrovascular syndrome spectrum is dependent on an individual’s sensitivity to hypoperfusion, which is influenced by collateral circulation and ischemic preconditioning.
An underlying vascular etiology is determined 50%-75% of the time.  Using various etiologic classification systems, it is estimated that >30% are due to cardioembolism, approximately 20% are due to intracranial small vessel disease, and large- to medium-sized vessel atheromatous disease accounts for 9%-13% of cases.  Less than 5% of cases are caused by arterial dissection or hypercoagulable states. 
Large vessel disease is often a product of hypertension causing endothelial damage and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Ulcerated plaques can propagate, causing progressive stenosis, obstruction or embolization. Proximal large vessel occlusion is the most severe form of ischemic stroke and carries the highest risk of morbidity and mortality.
Small vessel disease is caused by lipohyaline arteriolosclerosis, usually of branching/penetrating arteries that are less elastic and more susceptible to collagen deposition, which progresses with age.  Lacunar stroke is a clinical entity that occurs as a result of small vessel disease.
PEARLS
The most common cause of cardioembolism is atrial fibrillation, which carries an annual risk of stroke of 0.2%-23.6%, depending on the CHA2DS2VASc risk criteria.  Other major causes of cardiac embolism include, but are not limited to, left ventricular thrombosis, valvular vegetation, and ventricular septal defects. Cardioembolic strokes tend to be severe and occur in multiple vascular territories.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Focal stroke symptoms should usually correlate with a specific vascular territory. As a general rule, symptoms should be ablative phenomena or “negative,” indicating a loss of normal neuronal function. This is in contrast to irritative phenomena or “positive” symptoms that can be described as the addition of a new, atypical sensation.
Irritative phenomena occur more commonly in stroke mimics such as migraine, radiculopathy, or seizure, whereas ablative phenomena are more suggestive of ischemia. An example of this is in the distinction between the sensation of “numbness” (loss of sensation), which is ablative, vs. “tingling” (paresthesia), which is more often irritative. These may arguably be semantic, but interchanging these terms should be avoided, as distinguishing between the two may improve diagnostic accuracy. An important distinction is dizziness, which is discussed separately. (See Chapter: Vertigo and Dizziness)
Symptoms tend to occur abruptly. TIA has historically been clinically distinguished from stroke by the transience of symptoms. However, studies have shown that most symptoms lasting >1 h are associated with infarction, but symptom duration as brief as 10 s has been correlated with infarction on MRI. 
PITFALLS
The most common TIA and stroke mimics include complicated migraine and partial seizures, which together account for 24% and 44% of mimics, according to one study.  Other mimics include radiculopathy, hypoglycemia, metabolic derangement, infection, and psychogenic causes, among others.  Clinicians should be mindful of ruling out mimics to ensure diagnostic accuracy and appropriate treatment decisions. Table
In the pre-hospital and triage settings, a brief screening tool should be used consistently for stroke identification and severity grading. Stroke detection tools, such as FAST, CPSS, LAPSS, MASS, Med-PACS, OPSS, and ROSIER, have been associated with improved rates of thrombolytic administration and door-to-needle times.  Severity grading scales, including LAMS, FAST-ED, KPSS, sNIHSS, CPSSS, RACE, and VAN, have demonstrated reasonable sensitivity and specificity in predicting large vessel occlusion, which may influence downstream processes such as routing patients to endovascular-capable stroke centers or pre-alerting the neuro-interventional team.  EM:RAP Audio
As of this writing, patients with suspected stroke by prehospital screening should still be transported to the nearest ED capable of administering tissue plasminogen activator. Although research is ongoing to determine the benefits of bypassing a tissue plasminogen activator-capable facility to reach a thrombectomy-capable facility, the benefits are region-dependent and yet to be proven. 
In the setting of suspected acute stroke presenting at the ED, efficiency is key, and a comprehensive and encompassing bedside neurological exam is neither feasible nor practical. However, clinicians should be vigilant and thoughtful enough to detect subtle but potentially meaningful deficits. In cases where time-sensitive treatment decisions must be made, the initial assessment may be very brief and performed in parallel to other interventions.
For example, in many EDs, the patient with suspected acute stroke is taken directly from the ambulance to the CT scanner, and the initial assessment may be limited to the ABCs and a brief assessment of neurologic deficits. This should be followed by a more thorough neurologic exam when time allows.
The neurological exam in the ED should be divided into two components: the focused exam and the screening exam. Table
PEARLS
The focused exam is structured around relevant data gathered during the medical history and is catered to the differential diagnosis. The examiner should be focused on determining whether (1) there is a lesion and (2) where the lesion is localized.
The screening exam follows the focused exam and briefly surveys the remaining components of the neurologic system. It can be divided into 6 components:
(1) Mental status and higher cortical function
(2) Cranial nerves
(3) Sensory function
(4) Motor function
(5) Gait and coordination
(6) Reflexes
The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale is widely used to assess neurological deficits in stroke patients in a structured manner that is intended to be easily reproducible. Although originally designed as a research tool and heavily weighted toward the anterior circulation, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale provides a general measure of neurologic deficits using 11 items to produce a score of 0 to 42 Table.
Higher scores predict a larger lesion size, greater stroke severity, and worsened short- and long-term outcomes.
Reporting of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale is currently a requirement of regulatory and healthcare accreditation agencies.
Acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients should be frequently reassessed while in the hospital. Some patients with improved or even resolved symptoms may be temporarily perfusing ischemic tissue through collateral vessels. A loss of cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms can lead to reappearance of symptoms and clinical deterioration. Stuttering symptoms are also of particular concern and should be considered a warning of an unstable process, such as high-grade carotid stenosis, dissection, or showering emboli.
Radiographic Evaluation
PEARLS
In patients with ongoing stroke symptoms, the first priority in neuroimaging is to exclude intracranial hemorrhage.
Non-contrast head CT is the preferred initial imaging modality in most EDs due to its widespread availability, speed of acquisition and high sensitivity for hemorrhage.  Current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend that non-contrast head CT be obtained within 20 min of ED arrival in at least 50% of stroke patients potentially eligible for reperfusion therapies.  Non-contrast head CT alone may be used as the sole brain imaging modality prior to IV administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, and advanced imaging modalities should not delay administration. 
Non-contrast head CT scans in TIA and early acute ischemic stroke are most often normal. Occasionally, a hyperdense vessel sign may be seen, suggesting a thrombosed, occluded vessel. Early ischemic changes include loss of gray-white matter differentiation, sulcal effacement, and hypoattenuation along a vascular territory. Image Image Image
The Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) grades early brain hypoattenuation along 10 specific areas in the middle cerebral artery territory. The score ranges from 10 (best) to 1 (worst), as 1 point is subtracted for each region where there is evidence of early ischemic hypodensity. This score is often quantified by radiologists interpreting acute stroke CT scans, but should not be used as the sole criterion to withhold thrombolytic treatment. 
PEARLS
CTA is the preferred method for the visualization of intra- and extracranial cervicocephalic vessels in patients with acute cerebrovascular syndrome. Advances in the endovascular treatment of large vessel occlusion stroke reinforce the need to determine the “vessel status” of suspected stroke patients early. Confirmation of large vessel occlusion through the visualization of an occlusion along the proximal middle cerebral artery (M1 and M2 segments) was a prerequisite for enrollment in each of the recent positive endovascular trials.  CTA is also the test of choice for the diagnosis of cervical vessel dissection.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a sensitive alternative to CTA but is less commonly used, given the additional time for acquisition and lack of widespread availability. However, it is reasonable for patients with resolved transient symptoms thought to have experienced a TIA to undergo a bundled MRI/MRA to avoid redundant imaging. For those unable to receive gadolinium (allergy or renal insufficiency), non-contrast time-of-flight MRI is a reasonable alternative.
Perfusion imaging (either CT or MR-based) Image allows for the non-invasive quantitation of whole-brain cerebral blood flow and volume, in addition to the transit time of blood flow through brain tissue. Although the technology is not novel, it is being increasingly used for the selection of patients for endovascular therapy, as recent trials have shown that it can effectively function as a surrogate to time last known well when this is unknown, such as in patients with symptoms noted upon awakening.  Current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines support the use of CT or MR perfusion or MRI to select patients with confirmed anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and a symptom duration of 6-24 h. 
PEARLS
Diffusion weighted-MRI is the diagnostic gold standard for acute ischemic stroke.
A standard non-contrast MRI of the head includes the following sequences: diffusion-weighted imaging, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, apparent diffusion coefficient, gradient-recalled echo, and susceptibility-weighted imaging. A multi-modal MRI adds MRA with or without perfusion-weighted imaging.
Diffusion-weighted imaging Image and apparent diffusion coefficient are used together to identify areas of cytotoxic edema formation and can be seen within minutes of ischemic injury.  Ischemic lesions are hyperintense (bright white) on diffusion-weighted imaging and hypointense (black) on apparent diffusion coefficient. This indicates a decrease in water mobility as it shifts from the mobile extracellular space to the intracellular space, as occurs early in the ischemic cascade with disruption of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. This can also be transiently seen in focal epilepsy. 
T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images develop increased signal intensity during the 3-8 h following stroke onset.  Ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging without correlative visible T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity have a >90% likelihood of being <3 h from stroke onset.  Evidence of a diffusion-weighted imaging/T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch was used to safely select patients for IV tissue plasminogen activator in the WAKE-UP stroke trial. 
It should be noted that in 2009, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association endorsed a revised tissue-based definition of TIA to replace the classic time-based definition of “focal cerebral dysfunction of an ischemic nature lasting no longer than 24 h, with a tendency to recur.” 
PEARLS
The new definition describes a TIA as “a transient loss of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction.” Implied within this new definition is the acquisition of appropriate brain imaging to exclude infarction. Non-contrast head CT has a sensitivity of <40% for acute ischemia.  Accordingly, diffusion-weighted MRI should be preferentially obtained in suspected TIA patients when feasible, as supported by both the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (Class I, Level B) and American College of Emergency Physicians (Level C recommendation). 
Carotid Doppler ultrasound has slightly less sensitivity than MRA (and likely CTA) but is a reasonable alternative for the detection of severe extracranial carotid artery stenosis (70%-99%), and is currently supported by the American College of Emergency Physicians (Level C recommendation).  Ultrasound is somewhat less sensitive for the detection of vertebrobasilar stenosis and cervical vessel dissection. 
Laboratory Evaluation
PITFALLS
A fingerstick blood glucose test is indicated in all suspected stroke patients as soon as possible, as hypoglycemia is a common stroke mimic. This should be performed prehospital in patients being transported by emergency medical services. Additionally, hyperglycemia in stroke is associated with poor outcomes, although aggressive glucose control was not shown to improve patient outcomes in the recently completed SHINE trial (unpublished).
Screening labs in acute cerebrovascular syndrome typically include:
complete blood count to check for anemia or thrombocytopenia
coagulation studies (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, partial thromboplastin time) to check for coagulopathy
serum electrolytes
renal function
Troponin elevation is common and portends an increased risk of death and cardioembolic etiology. 
Acute stroke patients who are candidates for IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator should not have treatment withheld while awaiting lab results (except glucose) unless the patient has been taking a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or has a known coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Class IIa, Level B), as the incidence of unexpected abnormalities is very low. 
Numerous diagnostic and etiologic blood biomarkers have been explored in stroke and TIA, but none are used routinely in the clinical setting. The biomarkers of acute stroke etiology (BASE) study is currently enrolling. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Immediate Stabilization and Supportive Care
PEARLS
The care of all ED patients begins with basic resuscitation and the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation). Ensure that the patient has not lost airway protective reflexes; if this has occurred or seems imminent, emergency endotracheal intubation takes precedence. Supplemental oxygen is not necessary unless patients have an oxygen saturation <94%. 
Providers should be mindful to ensure that acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients maintain optimal cerebral perfusion. Cerebral perfusion pressure is the difference between the mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP). As a general rule, cerebral autoregulation is maintained at a cerebral perfusion pressure of 50-70 mm Hg.
The stroke patient should be positioned with the head in the midline and neutral position and supine as tolerated, as this has been shown to increase cerebral perfusion pressure by 20% compared with a 30° incline in a study using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. 
PEARLS
Blood pressure targets in acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients vary depending on the clinical scenario. Hypotension should always be avoided and corrected when present to maintain optimal cerebral perfusion.
Unless the patient is a likely candidate for IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy, permissive hypertension should be allowed up to 220/120 mm Hg and may be safely lowered by 15% in the first 24 h. 
Patients receiving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (as well as immediately before and following administration) should have a blood pressure <185/110 mm Hg (American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Class I, Level B), and <180/105 mm Hg at 24 h after tissue plasminogen activator administration.  Table
Stroke patients should have a bedside swallowing evaluation performed before any oral intake to prevent aspiration. The Quality in Acute Stroke (QASC) trial randomized 1,696 patients in 19 stroke units to standard care or aggressive screening for dysphagia, fever and hyperglycemia, demonstrating improved functional outcomes with aggressive intervention (absolute difference 15.7%, 95% CI 5.8-25.4, P = .002). 
Acute Ischemic Stroke Reperfusion Therapies
Intravenous thrombolysis: The debate regarding the true safety and efficacy of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke has been ongoing for almost 30 years. While several different parenteral thrombolytic agents have been studied as potential therapies for acute ischemic stroke, only alteplase is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication.
PEARLS
In patients with suspected ischemic stroke with disabling neurologic deficits of <4.5 h duration, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator should be considered if non-contrast head CT shows no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage and the patient does not meet additional exclusion criteria. The evidence surrounding the efficacy of systemic thrombolysis is described in greater detail below.
Although there are no specific numerical criteria to guide this, patients with stroke that is non-disabling should not be offered tissue plasminogen activator. 
If a patient otherwise qualifies to receive tissue plasminogen activator but onset of stroke symptoms are unknown (such as in a “wake-up” stroke), IV tissue plasminogen activator may be beneficial if the diffusion-weighted imaging lesion is less than one-third of the middle cerebral artery territory and there is no evidence of signal change of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence of MRI. This is based on the fact that it takes roughly 4.5 h for acute ischemic stroke signal changes to appear on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. 
Early studies in the 1950s used streptokinase and urokinase, which were associated with high rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and death before the advent of CT imaging.  In the 1990s, the MAST-E and MAST-I trials of streptokinase were stopped early due to increased mortality.  Given this increased mortality and the anaphylactic risk associated with streptokinase, attention shifted toward recombinant tissue plasminogen activator as an alternative.
ECASS-I was the first randomized trial of alteplase treatment within 6 h of time last known well, which enrolled 620 patients across Europe. No difference in disability or mortality was found in the intention-to-treat population, although protocol violations were noted in 17% of subjects. After accounting for this, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment showed a benefit. 
NINDS I & II consisted of two parts: part 1 (n = 291) assessed the proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥4 in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 24 h; and part 2 (n = 333) assessed 3-month functional outcomes. Patients were enrolled 0-3 h from time last known well, although the study protocol required that 1 patient be enrolled within 90 min of time last known well for every patient enrolled between 90 and 180 min from time last known well. Part 1 showed no difference in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 24 h, but part 2 showed a significant reduction in the 3-month disability in the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-treated group. Patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were 30% more likely to have minimal to no disability at 3 months, despite an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (6.4% vs. 0.6%, P < .001), translating to a number needed to treat of 7-8 for a favorable outcome.  NINDS was criticized for baseline imbalances between treatment groups, but the treatment effect has since been reinforced in post hoc analyses. 
Alteplase was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of stroke in 1996 based on the results of the NINDS trial. However, subsequent trials, including ECASS II (0-3 h and 3-6 h from time last known well), ATLANTIS A (0-6 h from time last known well) and ATLANTIS B (3-5 h from time last known well) were unable to demonstrate a consistent benefit of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. 
The second trial to show clinical efficacy of IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in stroke was ECASS III (n = 821), which randomized patients to treatment 3-4.5 h from time last known well. More favorable outcomes were present in the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-treated group (52.4% vs. 45.2%, odds ratio [OR] 1.34; 95% CI 1.02-1.76, P = .04). There was no difference in mortality despite an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (7.9% vs. 3.5%, P < .001).  The NNT for a favorable outcome in those treated up to 4.5 h was 14-15. Based on these results, the supported treatment window for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was extended from 0-3 h to 0-4.5 h from time last known well, which remains the standard practice today, supported by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, American College of Emergency Physicians, American College of Cardiology, European Stroke Organization, National Stroke Foundation, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Of note, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains Food and Drug Administration-approved only up to 3 h from time last known well, and organizations such as the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians have called for additional research before endorsing a 4.5-h treatment window.
The IST-3 trial was the third and largest trial to demonstrate clinical efficacy of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in stroke and enrolled patients up to 6 h from time last known well. This trial was conducted after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was already considered the standard care up to 4.5 h; thus, it was an open enrollment design using the “uncertainty principle,” in that it targeted those not meeting clear indications or contraindications for current treatment guidelines, and in whom there remained clinical equipoise; 3,035 patients were enrolled, with 53% >80 y old. The primary outcome was the proportion alive and independent at 6 mo, and the results were not statistically significant (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.92-1.24, P = .409). However, a significant ordinal analysis favored treatment, and this was most pronounced in the subgroup of patients treated within 3 h of onset (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.03-2.62).  While this trial was negative for the primary endpoint, the results were largely viewed as favorable, supporting the use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator with broader inclusion criteria.
Several pooled analyses have examined the collective efficacy of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator across multiple randomized controlled trials. Although subject to methodological heterogeneity across the trials, these analyses have generally supported the notion that “time is brain” and faster treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator increases the likelihood of a benefit. The largest of these to date is a Cochrane review published in 2014 after the completion of IST-3. Overall, 10,187 patients across 27 trials were included in the analysis, 7,012 of which were randomized to either alteplase or placebo (the others used different thrombolytic agents). When dichotomized to 0-3 h or 3-6 h from time last known well, earlier treatment was superior and more efficacious (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.28-1.90 vs. OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.2).  Within this analysis, a non-heterogenous subgroup of 1,779 patients across 6 trials strongly supported the benefit of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment within 3 h of time last known well (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54-0.80, P < .0001). A separate meta-analysis of individual data from 6,756 patients concluded that the benefit of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator likely extends somewhat beyond 4.5 h.  Although the mortality rate at 90 d was 1.4% higher in those treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, this was offset by an absolute increase in the disability-free survival of 10% within 0-3 h and 5% within 3-4.5 h.  This finding reinforces the notion that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is not a life-saving treatment but rather autonomy-preserving. In other words, the decision to treat with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator acknowledges and accepts an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and early death for an increased overall likelihood of reduced long-term functional disability.
The collective body of evidence supporting the efficacy of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has been criticized for multiple reasons; namely, that the 2 positive trials (NINDS II and ECASS III) had a low fragility index and the positive treatment effect could have easily been influenced by baseline differences between the groups and the subjectivity of the outcome measures of disability (such as the modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score). Additionally, critics have pointed out that study heterogeneity precludes reliable pooled analyses and there have been far more negative trials than positive ones. While this may justify the need for further studies, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has nevertheless become a widely supported treatment standard, and ED providers should feel comfortable knowing when treatment is and is not indicated.
Informed consent (or informed refusal) is generally encouraged prior to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment. A brief discussion of the risks and benefits with verbal assent and documentation reflecting this discussion is generally acceptable, and written informed consent is not typically necessary. The use of a visual aid may help to streamline the discussion and avoid persuasion through positive or negative framing. When the patient is unable to provide consent and a surrogate decision-maker cannot be located after reasonable effort, implied consent per institutional standards is reasonable.
PERSPECTIVES
The main risk associated with the use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients experiencing a non-ischemic stroke mimic have a very low risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. A meta-analysis of 8,942 patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator included 392 mimics, of which the symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rate was 0.5% (95% CI 0-2%), and this risk was much lower than that in stroke patients (risk ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.77; P = .010).  The iScore is a clinical tool that may assist in estimating the risk of 30-d and 1-y mortality in stroke patients. TableUsing clinical variables, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, initial glucose, and risk factors (atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cancer, dialysis dependence, and tobacco use), the iScore separates patients into low-, medium- and high-risk categories. In a cohort of over 12,000 patients, those with a low or medium iScore demonstrated a reduction in death and disability following recombinant tissue plasminogen activator administration, whereas those with a high iScore did not (number needed to treat 385). High iScores are associated with a significantly higher risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (number needed to harm 5-17; P < .05).  This tool can be found at: http://www.sorcan.ca/iscore.
PEARLS
In any patient with sudden neurologic deterioration during or shortly after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator infusion, consideration should be given to hemorrhagic complications. If intracerebral hemorrhage is suspected, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator should be stopped immediately and an emergency non-contrast head CT performed. Monitor vital signs and neuro checks every 15 min and check for signs of elevated ICP. If recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-induced intracerebral hemorrhage is confirmed, follow the institutional protocol, which should resemble the following:
Immediate labs, including blood type and crossmatch, repeat coagulation panel, platelet count, fibrinogen, and D-dimer
Infusion of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets, and aminocaproic acid
PEARLS
Neurosurgery consultationThere is a small risk of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-induced perioral and lingual edema. If this develops, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator infusion should be stopped immediately, and steroids and antihistamines should be administered. Patients should not have recombinant tissue plasminogen activator resumed and will require close respiratory monitoring. Table
The issue of whether to treat patients with minor and non-disabling stroke symptoms with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has been a source of debate. This is the most common reason for withholding recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in otherwise eligible patients,  and several case series have shown poor outcomes in one-third of patients with minor symptoms.  The efficacy of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in this population was recently studied in the PRISMS trial, which enrolled 313 of an intended 948 patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 0-5 and deficits that were deemed “not clearly disabling.” The trial was halted prematurely, but no significant difference was found in the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Scale of 0-1 at 90 d.  Additionally, the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was 3.2% in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients compared with 0% in the controls (risk difference 3.3%, 95% CI 0.8-7.4). The take-home message from this trial is that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment should be reserved for patients with symptoms thought to be clinically disabling, regardless of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.
Endovascular treatment:
Mechanical thrombectomy with modern-generation stent retrieval devices has revolutionized the treatment of large vessel occlusion stroke. Until recently, interventional stroke treatments were performed without proven clinical efficacy. Although the PROACT II trial in 1999 showed improved 90-d clinical outcomes in patients receiving intra-arterial thrombolysis with pro-urokinase (P = .04), subsequent trials of mechanical clot-retrieval devices, including IMS III, SYNTHESIS, and MR RESCUE, all published in 2013, were unable to demonstrate a benefit compared with standard treatment.  The results of these trials reintroduced clinical equipoise to a treatment that had become pervasive in the stroke community, which prompted several simultaneous, well-designed endovascular trials in 2015. The MR CLEAN, SWIFT PRIME, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, REVASCAT, and later THRACE in 2016 all demonstrated robust clinical benefit of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with confirmed large vessel occlusion (on CTA or MRA).  The results of these trials are summarized in the table below. The HERMES collaboration pooled patient data from the 5 landmark endovascular trials published in 2015 and found that the number needed to treat with mechanical thrombectomy to reduce disability on the modified Rankin Scale by 1 for a single patient was 2.6.  Current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines strongly support the use of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion when treatment can be initiated within 6 h of symptom onset.  Table
Extended window intervention has recently shown efficacy in both the DEFUSE 3 and DAWN trials using careful patient selection. DEFUSE 3 selected patients 6-16 h from symptom onset with confirmed large vessel occlusion and an ischemic core <70 mL, with a large perfusion/diffusion mismatch (ratio >1.8 and volume ≥15 mL). Functional independence, as measured by a modified Rankin Scale of 0-2 at 90 d was 45% in those who received thrombectomy compared with 17% in those who did not (P < .001).  DAWN selected patients 6-24 h from symptom onset using a mismatch between infarct volume and clinical deficit. Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was achieved at 90 d in 49% of patients receiving thrombectomy vs. 18% who did not.  These trials had much higher fragility indexes (13 and 22, respectively) compared with IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator trials and a number needed to treat to restore 1 patient to functional independence of 3-4. As a result, mechanical thrombectomy is currently recommended by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (Class I level A) for individuals meeting DAWN or DEFUSE 3 eligibility criteria up to 16 h from time last known well. 
Mechanical thrombectomy should be prioritized and systems optimized to initiate treatment as soon as is safely possible. 
Secondary Prevention Strategies
Prevention of future ischemic events in patients with acute cerebrovascular syndrome is imperative, and optimal treatment strategies can begin in the ED. Low-risk TIA patients who are being considered for discharge should be started on an antiplatelet agent unless a clear cardioembolic etiology has been identified or there are contraindications to antiplatelet treatment.
For most patients, aspirin (50-325 mg) alone is sufficient. Unless there is a contraindication, the best choice is likely aspirin. 
Current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines also support the use of aspirin/dipyridamole or clopidogrel monotherapy.  The POINT trial randomized 4,881 patients to aspirin/clopidogrel dual antiplatelet treatment or aspirin alone within 12 h of a minor stroke or TIA. While fewer patients in the dual antiplatelet arm experienced stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischemic vascular death at 90 d (5.0% vs. 6.5%; 95% CI 0.59-0.95; P = .02; number needed to treat = 66), there was an increased risk of major bleeding (0.9% vs. 0.4%; P = 0.02; number needed to harm = 200). 
Patients in the ED with TIA or stroke from a newly diagnosed cardioembolic source should be started on anticoagulation, unless contraindicated. As a generally high-risk sub-group, these patients should be admitted to the hospital for further work-up. 
Patients with minor or non-debilitating stroke who did not receive tissue plasminogen activator should be started on aspirin and clopidogrel within 24 h of stroke to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. 
After the first several days following the event, chronic hypertension should be corrected, aiming for a goal of ≤140/90 mm Hg. Statin therapy is generally recommended regardless of low-density lipoprotein levels, and diabetics should have adequate glycemic control. Healthy lifestyle modification, such as promoting physical activity, reducing sedentary time, weight loss if overweight, screening and treatment for sleep apnea, nutritional counseling advising a Mediterranean-type diet, smoking cessation, and limitation of alcohol consumption, are all encouraged. 
Risk Stratification in TIA
Clinical risk prediction scores, such as the ABCD2 score Table, are useful tools for the estimation of short-term stroke risk.  However, they are imperfect and do not reliably discriminate between high- and low-risk patients; therefore, all suspected TIA patients should undergo an etiologic work-up inclusive of cerebrovascular imaging when feasible. 
The Canadian TIA score Table was developed in a cohort of 3,906 patients across 8 EDs, of which 86 (2.2%) experienced a 7-d recurrent stroke. It consists of easily obtained clinical and historical variables as well as non-contrast head CT findings. The 17-point score discriminates 7-d stroke risk from a probability of 0.01-27.6% (area under the curve 0.77; 95% CI 0.73-0.82).  This score has now been validated, and may be a preferred clinical decision tool to augment clinical decision-making. 
Imaging-enhanced risk prediction tools such as the ABCD3-I score add advanced diagnostic testing (MRI and vascular imaging) to augment clinical risk prediction but are of limited use in the ED setting.  Once advanced diagnostic testing has been completed, there is little need for risk stratification. 
PITFALLS
Risk prediction scores alone should not dictate which patients with TIA are discharged from the ED. This position is supported by the American College of Emergency Physicians’ most recent clinical policy.  While some TIA patients may be safely discharged from the ED, almost all warrant a front-loaded work-up regardless of their clinical risk. ED observation units and accelerated diagnostic protocols offer a safe and efficient means to expedite this work-up without hospitalization.",Transient Ischemic Attack and Acute Ischemic Stroke

Key Concepts
As a general concept, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be divided into those that cause genital lesions and those that cause vaginal discharge.
Many women with an STI are asymptomatic.
Testing can often not be performed in real-time in the ED, and presumptive treatment should be initiated.
Failure to diagnose cervicitis can lead to ascending infections such as salpingitis and a tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). These have significant long-term effects on fertility.
PITFALLS
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is often underdiagnosed and clinicians should maintain a low threshold for initiating treatment.
PID is a clinical diagnosis. There is no specific sign, symptom, or physical exam finding that will confirm this diagnosis. Minimum and additional criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be used to increase the sensitivity of picking up PID.
The treatment of both cervicitis and PID due to gonorrhea or chlamydia should include at least double antibiotic coverage, as resistance rates are increasing.
Most non-pregnant patients in whom there is concern for STI, cervicitis, vaginitis, or PID will be clinically stable. Rarely, a TOA or PID can cause sepsis and patients must be rapidly identified and resuscitated.
Many STIs are considered reportable infections, and a process for partner notification must also be in place.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: a 21-year-old sexually active female presents with 3 d of pelvic pain, malodorous vaginal discharge, and a previous history of chlamydia. She is concerned that her previous treatment “didn’t work.”
History
A sexual history including pregnancy status must be obtained from every female who presents with concern for a genitourinary (GU) infection.
Physical
A focused physical exam includes an oropharyngeal exam in addition to a chaperoned external GU exam and speculum exam with visualization of the cervix.
Tests
Ulcers, vulvovaginitis, cervicitis, and PID:
Urine pregnancy test (if of reproductive age)
UA
Vaginal and cervical swabs:
“Wet prep” for bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis, and candida
Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV)
Treponemal and non-treponemal tests for syphilis
Offer screening for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B
PID in an ill-appearing patient also requires a CBC and imaging (pelvic U/S, CT, MRI)
Treatment
If the patient is in shock, resuscitate.
If there is evidence of peritonitis:
Maximize the patient’s hemodynamics with fluids and vasopressors as needed
Initiate antimicrobial treatment:
Cefoxitin 2 g IV q6h plus doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV q12h or
Clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h plus gentamicin 3-5 mg/kg IV q24h or
Cefotetan 2 g IV q12h plus doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV q12h
Consult GYN immediately.
Disposition
Home
Almost all patients with ulcerative infections, vulvovaginitis, or cervicitis can be discharged home.
Most patients with PID can be discharged home per the PEACH trial. 
Patients should be referred for follow-up with primary care or GYN within 48-72 h.
Admission
Patients with a severe clinical illness including fever, an inability to tolerate oral medications/fluids, severe pain, pregnant patients, patients requiring surgical intervention, patients with a pelvic abscess, patients with complications of genital herpes, infections such as meningitis or urinary retention, or patients who are unreliable to adhere to outpatient follow-up/a prescribed medication regimen require admission.
Rarely, patients will present with sepsis and may require intensive care treatment and resuscitation.

Background
Epidemiology
There are 1 million new cases of STI worldwide each day (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis). Around 500 million people are infected with genital HSV around the world. 
The most common infections in the U.S. are STIs.  In women, these infections cause vaginitis, cervicitis, and PID. Specific STIs can also have non-GU organ involvement.
In 2017, there were 1.7 million cases of chlamydia and approximately 560,000 cases of gonorrhea reported to the CDC. Cases have been increasing each year since 2013. 
Adolescents and young adults (ages 15-24 y) make up half of the new cases each year.  Women under age 25 have the largest burden of infection due to chlamydia. 
The majority of patients with STIs are cared for in the primary care setting, but 7%-16% of cases are cared for in the ED and this increases each year. 
ED patients are more likely to be male, younger, and non-white. 
70%-80% of chlamydia infections in women are asymptomatic, of which 15%-40% will ascend the genital tract to cause PID, some of which are subclinical infections. 
Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral STI in the U.S., and is associated with significant health disparities. It affects 13% of black women, but only 1.8% of non-Hispanic white women.  Trichomoniasis also affects >11% of women over the age of 40. 
HSV-1 or HSV-2 can cause genital herpes, although most cases of recurrent herpes are caused by HSV-2. Current prevalence estimates are that around 12% of adolescents and young adults are infected by HSV-2. 
Approximately 50 million people in the U.S. are infected with HSV-2.
An increasing number of cases of HSV-1 cause anogenital herpes, especially in young women and men who have sex with men. 
The prevalence of HSV may be higher, as latent infections and the under-recognition of a wide spectrum of presentations is common.
Syphilis rates are increasing in the U.S., and 88% of cases occur in men. Most cases are transmitted sexually. 
Non-STIs are also a common cause of gynecologic infection in the ED. BV is a common infection in women of reproductive age, and has a 15% prevalence rate in pregnant women. There are an estimated 7.4 million cases per year in the U.S. 
At the most severe end of the spectrum of gynecologic infections is PID. PID is an upper reproductive tract inflammatory response secondary to infection. The incidence of PID is declining each year in the U.S., perhaps due to increased screening for STIs. 
The term “PID” includes endometritis, salpingitis, salpingo-oophoritis, myometritis, TOA/complex, peritonitis, and perihepatitis.
Perihepatitis occurs in 10% of cases.
PID can lead to serious reproductive consequences. Women with PID develop infertility (10%-20%) and chronic pelvic pain (40%); 10% of women who conceive after PID will have an ectopic pregnancy. 
The true incidence rate of TOA is not known, but it is estimated to affect 2%-3% of women with PID.
The most common cause of death from PID is a TOA rupture, which carries a 5%-10% mortality risk. 
Over 85% of acute PID infections are caused by sexually transmitted pathogens or from microbes associated with BV. The remaining 15% are from respiratory or enteric organisms that colonize the lower genital tract. 
Approximately 15% of untreated chlamydia cases will progress to PID. 
Chronic PID (>30 d duration) is far less common and due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Actinomyces. 
Pathophysiology
STIs causing genital lesions
Syphilis
Treponema pallidum is a spirochete bacterium that is transmitted by sexual contact and direct contact with an infectious lesion, vertical transmission (the spirochete easily crosses the placenta in pregnancy), or very rarely through a blood transfusion.
Lesions present at the site of inoculation. The spirochete easily evades the immune system and travels to the lymph nodes, where it then becomes disseminated.
Syphilis has early (primary and secondary) and late (latent, tertiary, and neurologic) phases.
Primary syphilis chancres heal without treatment in 3-6 wk, but the organism has already disseminated by this time.
Secondary syphilis will develop in 25% of untreated patients a few weeks to months following the initial infection. Even without treatment, secondary syphilis symptoms can resolve.
Late syphilis develops up to 30 y after infection in 25%-40% of untreated patients. 
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)
LGV is an ulcerative STI caused by strains of Chlamydia trachomatis that are typically confined to tropical and subtropical areas. However, over the last 20 y, LGV has become more common in developed countries, including two outbreaks in North America, particularly among men who have sex with men. 
HIV co-infection is extremely common.
LGV infections occur when the bacteria enters through a break in the skin or through the mucosal membrane. It then travels to regional lymph nodes. The incubation time is 3-12 d. 
Three stages of infection occur:
Primary: Site of inoculation
Secondary: Occurs weeks after the primary stage involving the lymph nodes, rectum, or anus
Tertiary: Due to chronic inflammatory lesions that lead to scarring. 
HSV
Genital herpes is caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2, both double-stranded DNA viruses. Many cases are subclinical and can go unrecognized for a long time.
HSV is often transmitted when the patient is asymptomatic due to viral shedding, or because the infection is not recognized. Transmission is via contact with lesions either through the mucous membranes or via genital/oral secretions.
Herpes infection occurs in three forms: primary, non-primary, and recurrent. The incubation period is 2-12 d.
Primary infection refers to the first infectious episode in a patient who does not have HSV-1 or HSV-2 antibodies.
Non-primary infection occurs in a patient who already has antibodies to HSV-1 and then becomes infected with HSV-2, or vice versa.
Recurrent herpes is the reactivation of either HSV-1 or HSV-2.
Herpes is a chronic, lifelong infection with no cure.
Infection with HSV-2 is linked to an increased risk of HIV infection.
HSV in pregnancy can be transmitted to the neonate during delivery from direct contact with lesions, and the risk is even higher during a primary maternal infection.
HSV in an immunocompromised host is usually due to reactivation of the virus. These episodes are typically more severe and have a longer duration compared with HSV in immunocompetent patients.
Cervicitis and Vulvovaginitis
Acute cervicitis traditionally refers to an infection causing inflammation of the cervix. Cervicitis can occur in conjunction with vulvovaginitis or as an isolated pathology. Cervicitis can also be chronic or associated with chemical or mechanical irritation.
The major criteria for the diagnosis of acute cervicitis are purulent or mucopurulent endocervical discharge or endocervical bleeding.  Cervicitis is typically caused by STIs, which include chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, HSV, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Other causes include group A streptococci and BV.Photo
Vulvovaginitis is a group of disorders of the vulva and/or vagina that can be caused by infection (90%), inflammation, or disruption of the normal genital tract flora. The vagina is usually an acidic environment in premenopausal women with normal estrogen levels, which usually prevents pathogen growth.
Infections (localized or systemic), antibiotics, oral contraceptives, pregnancy, sexual activity, hygiene products, and foreign bodies can disrupt the vaginal pH and normal flora.
Vulvovaginitis is usually caused by Candida albicans (20%-25%), BV (40%-50%), and/or trichomoniasis (15%-20%). 
Noninfectious causes include allergic, irritant, and atrophic/inflammatory vaginitis and comprise 10% of cases. 
Allergic vaginitis is caused by topical products that include douches, latex condoms or diaphragms, medications, clothing, and sperm.
Irritant vaginitis is often caused by topical products such as soaps, tampons, contraceptive devices, sex toys, pessaries, medications, and clothing.
Atrophic vaginitis can occur during menopause, lactation, after an oophorectomy or in the setting of premature ovarian failure, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunologic disorders, endocrine disorders, and anti-estrogen medications. 
Candida vulvovaginitis
Candida (80% is C. albicans) is a yeast that is part of the normal vaginal flora. 
Local overgrowth leads to a vulvovaginitis.
More widespread infection can occur if patients are immunocompromised. Diabetes, HIV, glucocorticoid use, and intrauterine device (IUD) or diaphragm use for contraception can be risk factors for vulvovaginal candidiasis.
Women with recurrent candidiasis should be tested for HIV.
BV
BV is a polymicrobial infection that is characterized by the absence of vaginal lactobacilli.  Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum have all been implicated.
Most women with BV are asymptomatic. 
Risk factors include a low socioeconomic status, vaginal douching, smoking, new or multiple sex partners, and unprotected sexual intercourse.  Women who have sex with women have a 2.5× increased likelihood of BV compared with women who have sex with men. 
Controversy exists as to whether BV is sexually transmitted or simply sexually associated. There is a 66% recurrence rate within 6 mo of a 7-d treatment with metronidazole. This is thought to be due to re-infection by a partner.
BV is associated with the transmission of HIV and is strongly associated with C. trachomatis co-infection. 
In pregnancy, BV has been linked with an increased risk of preterm birth, miscarriage in women undergoing in vitro fertilization, chorioamnionitis, and endometritis after childbirth or abortion. However, treatment does not completely reduce these adverse outcomes.
BV can progress to PID (See: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease).
Sexually transmitted pathogens
Trichomoniasis
Risk factors for Trichomonas vaginalis, a flagellated protozoan, include low socioeconomic status, multiple sex partners, other STIs, unprotected sexual intercourse, drug use, and smoking. 
Trichomoniasis causes vaginitis but is associated with a dramatically increased risk of endometritis, especially if an HSV-2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or C. trachomatis co-infection is present.
Asymptomatic infection is reported in 50%-85% of patients. 
Gonorrhea
N. gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus, is a human-only pathogen that can be sexually transmitted. It can evade the immune system and typically causes localized infections. However, it can become disseminated. Infection does not provide future immunity.
Chlamydia
Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is a gram-negative obligate intracellular pathogen. No vaccine exists to prevent infection. It is sexually transmitted and can cause an ascending infection. Some serotypes cause LGV, especially in patients that participate in anal sex. 
Chlamydia is asymptomatic in most women, but also causes urethritis, cervicitis, and PID, including salpingitis and endometritis. Rates of progression to upper genital tract infection are unknown due to limitations on patient presentation, testing methods, and hospitalization rates.  Ct is isolated in one-fourth of PID patients. 
Reinfection with Ct after adequate treatment is common. Women with three or more infections are four times more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. 
Mycoplasma genitalium:
Mycoplasma genitalium is considered to be an emerging STI. There is a well-established association between it and non-gonococcal urethritis in men, but it is extremely difficult to culture.
The pathogenesis of Mycoplasma genitalium in women is less clear. One study in women shows that it doubles the risk for cervicitis and PID.  It may also contribute to female infertility and increased rates of preterm delivery. 
Mycoplasma genitalium can be detected in 10%-30% of patients with clinical cervicitis, and has been detected in 2%-22% of PID cases. 
Prevalence rates are likely 1%-3% in men and women. 
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
PID is a female upper reproductive tract inflammatory response caused by an infection. The infection typically spreads from the lower genital tract as a spontaneous ascension of microbes.
Normal vaginal flora contains microbes that can become pathogenic. The endocervical canal usually prevents these microbes from ascending. Infections causing cervicitis can disrupt this barrier, which provides a portal of entry for infection to ascend into the pelvic organs. Inflammation results from the ascending infection and can cause endometritis, salpingitis, salpingo-oophoritis, TOA, and even peritonitis and perihepatitis.
PID is generally considered a polymicrobial infection, but common pathogens include C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and M. genitalium in pre-menopausal women. BV pathogens (also polymicrobial) and even respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus can also cause acute PID. Enteric pathogens include Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, group B streptococci, and Campylobacter.
C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae can also cause a subclinical PID.
PID not responding to treatment after 7-10 d may also be due to M. genitalium.
Rarely, a patient may present with chronic PID (>30 d duration) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Actinomyces species.
Perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome) is an inflammation of the liver capsule and associated peritoneum. It is unclear whether this inflammation is caused by the direct extension of infection from the pelvic organs or lymphatics, or whether it is immunologically mediated. Liver enzymes should remain normal despite the surrounding inflammation.
Tubo-ovarian abscess is most commonly a complication of PID. Uncommon causes also include extension from an adjacent infected organ or hematogenous spread from another infection. It can also be associated with a pelvic organ malignancy.
Most TOAs are also polymicrobial and not due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. Instead, these two microbes likely facilitate other vaginal microbes to ascend from the lower genital tract to the upper genital tract.
A tubo-ovarian complex on imaging in a postmenopausal woman should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. 
PID is less common later in pregnancy due to the presence of a cervical mucus plug in the second and third trimesters. However, it can still occur during the first trimester.
Diagnostic Considerations
Screening
Screening for STIs in the ED is less common than in other healthcare settings, but may be offered. 
Screening for chlamydia, particularly in young women, is effective at reducing the incidence of PID. 
Asymptomatic disease occurs frequently and is still transmittable while patients are asymptomatic.
Adolescent rates of asymptomatic disease of gonorrhea or chlamydia have been reported in up to 10% of non-STI ED visits. 
Ct and Gonococcal (GC) rates are highest in the southern states. 
Ct infection increases the transmission rate of HIV co-infection. 
Pregnant women can transmit Ct at birth, which can lead to neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonitis.
Untreated STIs can lead to an increased risk of HIV, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, PID, premature labor, and low birth weight. 
Infection prevalence determines the cost-effectiveness of screening programs.
Consider patient risk factors and access to other healthcare resources when considering screening. Adolescents often provide inaccurate sexual histories and may not access other health care settings due to privacy concerns. 
Risk groups, which guide CDC and other recommendations for screening include: 
Persons aged 15-24 y
Men who have sex with men
Pregnant women
Patients with a history of a previous STI
HIV+ patients
Illicit drug users
People who reside in a correctional facility/detention center
Risk factors include:
A new partner within 60 d
Multiple partners
Partner recently treated for STI
Inconsistent barrier protection use
Sexual contact with a sex worker, anonymous sex partner, or in exchange for money/drugs
If EDs do not provide STI screenings, patients should be referred to facilities in the community or through public health for complete testing and counselling.
The CDC website gettested.cdc.gov provides a list of local clinics.
Refer to the HIV chapter for HIV-specific screening, diagnosis, and treatment (See Chapter: Human Immunodeficiency Virus).
Clinical Presentation
Patients may complain of genital or oral lesions, vaginal irritation, changes in vaginal discharge, irregular bleeding, and pelvic pain or discomfort. Those who are critically ill may also present with signs and symptoms of sepsis.
Sexual history
A sexual history should be obtained using a non-judgmental approach, and should include:
Partners: Any new, multiple or concurrent partners
Practices: Any trauma and anatomic sites of exposure
Barrier protection use
Contraceptive use
Past history of STIs and treatment
A guide to taking a sexual history can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/SexualHistory.pdf
STIs can be asymptomatic in women. Recurrent infections are also common.
Genital lesions may be present.
Syphilis:
Primary: A chancre is a painless, clean-based indurated ulcer at the site of the primary infection
Secondary: A diffuse body rash (often involving the palms and soles), condyloma lata, mucous patches on the tongue and lymphadenopathy can be present.
Latent and tertiary: An asymptomatic period followed by severe, multisystem manifestations
HSV:
Primary infection: HSV presentation is variable and some patients may be only mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. At the severe end, patients may present with multiple painful genital or oral ulcers accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, malaise, and a headache.
Genital vesicular ulcers can cause dysuria and acute urinary retention. Photo
Cervicitis may occur. Photo
Rarely, a lumbosacral radiculomyelitis can occur with the loss of sacral sensation and urinary retention (2% of cases).
Primary lesions can last on average for 19 d, with viral shedding occurring for an additional 2-5 d. 
Non-primary infection: Usually presents with fewer lesions and milder, if any, systemic symptoms.
Recurrent infection: Recurrences are less severe and of shorter duration.
Extragenital complications: Aseptic meningitis occurs in up to 8%.
Perianal lesions and proctitis can occur, especially in men who have sex with men. Photo
LGV:
Primary: Begins as a painless small papule at the site of inoculation that spontaneously heals and often goes unnoticed.
Secondary: Painful inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy that is most often unilateral. When lymphadenopathy occurs in both chains of nodes, a “groove sign” appears with adenopathy above and below the inguinal ligament (10%-20% of cases).  The lymphadenopathy may be cervical. Conjunctivitis may occur. Fever, malaise, myalgias, and headaches are common. Anorectal involvement presents as hemorrhagic proctitis in men and women.
Tertiary: Scarring due to chronic inflammation affects the eyes and genital tract, leading to fibrosis and lymphatic obstruction. Strictures and fissures form in the rectum, including the destruction of the external genitalia. 
Vulvovaginitis causes vaginal discharge that may be malodorous, vulvar or vaginal irritation, and/or pruritus.
Vaginal discharge should be present but it can be difficult to distinguish between physiologic vaginal discharge and infection, especially during pregnancy or in patients taking estrogen-progesterone oral contraceptives.
Candida:
Vulvovaginal irritation will be present. The physical exam will reveal vulvar and/or vaginal erythema, edema, and a white discharge. The consistency of the discharge is typically curd-like but can be watery. The cervix usually is normal.
Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis is recurrent (>4 infections per year), severe, or involves an immunocompromised patient. Cultures should be performed as the Candida species may be non-albicans.
Bacterial vaginosis:
A thin malodorous (fishy) homogeneous discharge is typically present. Vaginal inflammation is often absent. The Amsel criteria can be used to predict BV. Three out of the four criteria yields a sensitivity of 70%-90% and a specificity of 90%-94%: thin, homogeneous discharge, a positive whiff test (see Laboratory Evaluation), clue cells on microscopy, and a vaginal pH >4.5. 
Trichomoniasis:
Most women have minimal to no symptoms (70%-85%). 
Vulvovaginal irritation may be associated with a purulent, malodorous, thin vaginal discharge. Dysuria, dyspareunia, pruritus, and lower abdominal pain may be present, but only a small minority of patients have typical symptoms. 
Cervicitis is generally diagnosed based on the patient’s history and physical exam. The actual etiology may not be known in the ED pending testing.
Women may report vaginal discharge and irregular vaginal bleeding, which may include post-coital or inter-menstrual bleeding. Other symptoms include: dyspareunia, dysuria, or urinary frequency that may be due to concomitant urethritis. The patient should be afebrile, and patients with cervicitis should not have pelvic or abdominal pain. Vulvovaginal irritation may be present due to co-infection with BV or candida.
70%-80% of chlamydia infections in women are asymptomatic.
Physical exam should include a chaperoned speculum exam. Findings include cervical or endocervical purulent or mucopurulent discharge, and/or a friable cervix. Cervical findings can sometimes suggest the pathogen involved. Non-infectious etiologies are difficult to detect on physical exam.
Strawberry cervix/punctate hemorrhages suggest Trichomonas
Mucopurulent discharge with cervical edema and a friable cervix suggests chlamydia or gonorrhea. Photo
Controversy regarding the utility of the pelvic exam currently exists in the literature. However, as cervicitis and PID are clinical diagnoses, a physical exam must include a speculum exam with visualization of the cervix to diagnose cervicitis. A physical exam also decreases the rates of misdiagnosis. 
Pelvic inflammatory disease
In addition to the signs and symptoms of cervicitis, women will also complain of lower pelvic pain, adnexal pain, or dyspareunia. In more severe cases, they may have a fever, abdominal pain, and signs of sepsis.
Physical exam findings include cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness. These findings increase the likelihood of this diagnosis to 65%-90%, but all three do not need to be present to make the diagnosis. In fact, clinicians should maintain a low threshold for this diagnosis as many women have mild and non-specific symptoms. Additional criteria increase the likelihood of PID Table.
Fever and rebound tenderness are uncommon unless PID is severe. No single physical finding is sensitive or specific for acute PID. It is a clinical diagnosis that is based on a constellation of findings. Even laparoscopy can miss cases of endometritis or subtle salpingitis.
TOA:
Fever is more common, although in one patient series, 40% had no fever on presentation.  Women may have a palpable adnexal mass.
A “ruptured” or leaking abscess will cause peritonitis and sepsis.
Perihepatitis will present with pleuritic right upper quadrant pain, and often have referred pain to the right shoulder. There is usually tenderness in the right upper quadrant on exam.
Radiographic Evaluation
Pelvic inflammatory disease:
Transvaginal U/S or MRI may demonstrate thickened, fluid-filled fallopian tubes with or without free fluid and a tubo-ovarian complex.
A TOA should be considered in women with PID. Women may not have a palpable mass on exam, so have a low threshold to obtain imaging, especially in patients who have been on antibiotics and are not improving.
Pelvic U/S is usually first-line due its wide availability, low cost, and lack of ionizing radiation. It is also helpful in evaluating for alternative diagnoses, including ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis, or even appendicitis.
A TOA will appear as a multilocular mass and the normal adnexal anatomy may be altered. There is also usually inflammatory debris within the mass. A “cogwheel” sign due to thickened endosalpingeal folds is very specific for a TOA.
CT is preferred when U/S is negative but clinical suspicion for TOA is still high, there is peritonitis, or there is diagnostic uncertainty.
A TOA will appear as a thick-walled, ring-enhancing pelvic mass. The mesosalpinx may also be thickened and pelvic fat infiltrated. Ascites and lymphadenopathy are uncommon. 
MRI can be considered if the diagnosis remains uncertain in the clinically stable patient. T1-weighted imaging will show low signal intensity at the site of the TOA, and T2-weighted images will have a high signal intensity. MRI has a higher sensitivity and specificity than U/S for TOA. 
Laboratory Evaluation
It is well documented that providers are not effective at predicting who has an STI.  Jenkins et al. report that 7.9%-31.9% of test-negative patients are treated empirically.  However, 43%-84% of test-positive patients were not given initial empiric treatment.  Testing for STIs is recommended as opposed to empiric treatment without testing.  However, most tests do not have a rapid turnaround time, which often impacts treatment decisions in the ED, so empiric treatment is usually given in the ED.
It is imperative that a call-back system be in place to communicate delayed results to patients. Partnering with the local public health department can help decrease the number of patients who cannot be reached with positive results. Antibiotic resistance to gonorrhea is of increasing concern, and thus a balanced approach to empiric treatment and guided treatment after testing must be sought.
When testing for any STI, patients should be offered screening for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis.
All women of reproductive age should be evaluated for pregnancy.
Patients who appear clinically ill should have a CBC drawn, although leukocytosis may not be present even with severe PID or TOA.
Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are usually not specific nor sensitive enough to guide diagnosis or treatment.
Genital lesions:
Syphilis:
No single test is available for all stages of disease. For primary syphilis, clinical examination and serologic testing are needed.
Treponemal antibody tests: Reactivity persists for life. The test is expensive and more difficult to perform, but more specific. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and T pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) are types of treponemal tests.
Non-treponemal antibody tests: Reactivity decreases over time. They are not specific to syphilis so there may be false positives. Easy to perform and good for screening and to follow for cure. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) are non-treponemal tests.
Symptomatic patients require both treponemal and non-treponemal tests. The non-treponemal test is usually ordered first and, if positive, a treponemal test is then ordered to confirm syphilis.
Either test can be used for asymptomatic patients as a screening test.
A positive RPR or VDRL must then be confirmed with a treponemal test.
False negatives may occur early in the course of the disease, and patients should be retested in 2-4 wk.
Positive tests may require consultation with an infectious disease specialist, as the interpretation of positive (reactive) results depends on clinical symptoms, history of a previous infection, and immune status of the patient.
HSV: NAAT of a specimen obtained from the base of the ulcer can be sent, but false negatives occur if there is no ulcer or active viral shedding. Serum serology is not needed or useful in the ED.
LGV: mostly a clinical diagnosis but NAAT from the ulcer can be sent and is preferred over culture.
Vulvovaginitis and cervicitis:
If available, a vaginal swab for pH. Often not done in the emergency setting.
Normal pH is <4.5
Candida, trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, chlamydia: pH <4.5
BV: pH >4.5
Vaginal swab for microscopy (“wet prep”):
Clue cells seen on microscopy confirm the diagnosis of BV.
Visualization of motile trichomonads confirms the diagnosis of trichomoniasis. However, if it is negative, it should be followed up with a NAAT. 
Budding yeast, hyphae, or pseudohyphae are seen with Candida species.
When 10% potassium hydroxide is added to the prep, the visualization of the yeast is improved.
Whiff test: vaginal discharge mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide produces an amine (fishy) odor in BV.
Culture:
An endocervical culture can be done for gonorrhea, but NAAT is preferred.
A culture should be performed in cases of suspected treatment failure. 
Cultures may be necessary for non-endocervical specimens, as NAAT is not FDA-cleared for rectal, oropharyngeal, or conjunctival collection.
Viral culture for HSV is indicated for ulcerative disease, but the sensitivity is low and declines as lesions heal. 
Gram stain:
The gold-standard test for BV, but not usually performed in the ED.
Can also be considered when testing specifically for urethral gonorrhea in men. It is not recommended in women.
NAAT:
Detects RNA using amplification techniques and is the preferred diagnostic method for diagnosing trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. However, the turnaround time is typically 1-4 d, making them less useful in the ED for real-time decision making.
Urine NAAT: first-catch urine test. This is more sensitive for chlamydia but less sensitive for gonorrhea than clinician-collected swabs.  They are considered the gold standard for testing according to the CDC, and preferred in men. 
Vaginal and endocervix swab NAAT:
Recommended for T. vaginalis instead of wet mount microscopy. Sensitivity is 96% and specificity is 97%. 
Vaginal swabs preferred for chlamydia to yield the highest sensitivity. 
An endocervical or vaginal swab can be collected for gonorrhea testing with equal sensitivities.
Self-collection vaginal swabs are equally sensitive and specific compared with clinician-collected swabs. However, this limits examination of the cervix and vaginal vault.  Patients refusing a speculum exam should be offered self-collection swabs.
Rectal and oropharyngeal swabs: NAAT can be performed for gonorrhea and chlamydia, although this is not FDA-approved so labs must apply for a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) waiver.
A PCR assay for HSV DNA is more sensitive than a viral culture, but a negative test does not indicate the absence of infection. 
Point-of-care tests:
Rapid antigen test for T. vaginalis from a vaginal swab, with results reported in 10 min, shows promise for use in the ED. Negative results should be followed up with a standard NAAT. 
For Candida, it has a sensitivity of 77%-97% and a specificity of 77%-99%.
Therapeutic Considerations
The CDC recommends that presumptive treatment should be offered for those patients at an increased risk of STIs, especially if follow-up is not guaranteed. Patients at an increased risk include those age 25 y or younger, with new or multiple sex partners, and engaging in unprotected sex.  Overtreatment is preferred in many of these circumstances.
Genital ulcers/lesions:
HSV infection can be treated with systemic antiviral medications to help control signs and symptoms. Patients need to be aware that these medications do not eradicate the disease.
First clinical episodes can be treated with:
Acyclovir 400 mg PO q8h for 7-10 d or
Valacyclovir 1 g PO q12h for 7-10 d or
Famciclovir 250 mg PO q8h for 7-10 d
Topical antivirals have no role in the treatment of HSV.
Suppressive therapy reduces HSV recurrence in the majority of patients, is considered safe, and improves quality of life. This therapy is best offered through primary care.
Patients who present with a recurrent herpes episode and are not on suppressive therapy can be placed on acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, but must be started within 1 d of lesion onset or prodrome. 
Syphilis: Serology testing should be performed, and ideally the results should be available prior to treatment. However, patients with a classic chancre, a high clinical likelihood of secondary syphilis, those who are unlikely to follow-up, or have a known exposure can be offered empiric treatment in the ED.
In the non-pregnant, HIV-negative patient, penicillin G 2.4 million units IM is the treatment of choice for primary syphilis.
A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction can occur after penicillin treatment. Fever, chills, myalgias, malaise, flushing, tachycardia and even mild hypotension can begin 1 h after the injection, and symptoms may persist for 24 h. Treatment is supportive and the patient should be warned of this possible reaction and instructed to take antipyretics as needed.
Alternatives to penicillin include doxycycline 100 mg PO q12h for 14 d or ceftriaxone 1-2 g IM q24h for 10-14 d or amoxicillin 3 g plus probenecid 500 mg PO q12h for 14 d.
A single dose of azithromycin can be used in the pregnant patient, but resistant strains are a concern. 
LGV: Treat based on clinical suspicion.
Doxycycline 100 mg PO q12h for 21 d or erythromycin 500 mg PO q6h for 21 d. Third-line therapy is azithromycin 1 g PO once weekly for 3 wk if doxycycline or erythromycin are contraindicated.
In pregnancy and women who are lactating, use azithromycin 500 mg PO q6h for 21 d.
Vulvovaginitis: Treatment recommendations are in Table.
BV
Pregnant patients with clue cells on wet prep should be treated, even if they are asymptomatic.
Non-pregnant, symptomatic patients should also be treated.
Non-pregnant, asymptomatic patients do not require treatment.
Recurrent vulvovaginitis should be treated with 10-14 d of topical or oral azole therapy. This is followed by 150 mg oral fluconazole weekly for 6 mo.
Cervicitis and PID:
Dual therapy is recommended, usually with a cephalosporin plus azithromycin or doxycycline.
Gonococcus has a high resistance to fluoroquinolones, and these should be avoided.
Have a low threshold to treat women with signs, symptoms and a physical exam consistent with PID. Given high lost-to-follow-up rates, especially in adolescents, consider empiric treatment for both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis for patients under the age of 25 y. 
For cervicitis, azithromycin is the preferred second drug due to compliance with a single dose and higher rates of tetracycline gonococcal resistance.
All women with PID should be covered with treatment for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis even if endocervical swabs are negative. 
Treatment for PID requires at least two agents to cover implicated organisms.
In addition to a cephalosporin, a 2-wk course of doxycycline is recommended. A single dose of azithromycin is inadequate.
Consider adding in metronidazole for anaerobic coverage for a severe or complicated infection with a TOA, in women with recent gynecologic instrumentation, or when trichomoniasis or BV is identified. Research has not shown anaerobic coverage to be superior. 
TOA:
GYN should be consulted and surgery considered for women with findings concerning for a TOA rupture, which may include peritonitis or sepsis. Abscesses larger than 7 cm will typically require surgical intervention. 
Medical management is effective in up to 70% of cases. 
Laparoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. 
Image-guided drainage can be considered via the transvaginal, transrectal, transabdominal, or transgluteal approach. While smaller studies have demonstrated some success, there are no randomized control trials that demonstrate the superiority over any of these techniques over a traditional laparoscopic approach. 
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
Genital ulcers:
HSV: patients must be counselled on preventing disease transmission, and should be referred back to primary care or GYN for suppressive therapy in the setting of recurrent disease. www.ashasexualhealth.org can be helpful. 
Women of childbearing age should be instructed that if they become pregnant they should tell their obstetrician that they have herpes.
Syphilis: patients require repeat testing and monitoring for an appropriate clinical response. Primary care or infectious disease specialists should be involved.
LGV: testing for HIV is essential.
Vulvovaginitis and cervicitis:
If the cause of the vulvovaginitis is identified and successfully treated, patients generally do not require repeat testing to confirm cured BV or gonorrhea.
In BV, repeat testing in asymptomatic women may lead to false-positive results, as many of the bacteria are part of the normal vaginal flora.
If the patient is being treated for oropharyngeal gonorrhea using an alternative regimen, another culture or NAAT should be done 14 d after treatment.
Patients with cervicitis or PID due to chlamydia should be retested in 3 mo (1 mo if pregnant) with NAAT. All sex partners from the previous 60 d (or the most recent partner if the time period is >60 d) should also be tested and treated.
Continued symptoms are not usually due to treatment failure, and should prompt repeat testing as re-infection is possible and common.
Patients with cervicitis due to trichomoniasis should be retested for all sexually active women 3 mo after initial treatment.
If the etiology of the patient’s symptoms is not determined, refer to GYN. Some women will require a biopsy to evaluate for a vulvar neoplasia or inflammatory vulvar dermatoses.
Pelvic inflammatory disease:
Patients should show clinical improvement within 72 h of treatment initiation. If not, consider additional testing or imaging including a diagnostic laparoscopy.
Prevention
To date, there is no vaccine for Ct, GC, trichomoniasis, BV, mycoplasma, herpes simplex, syphilis, or HIV.
Vaccination for human papilloma virus and hepatitis B virus can prevent transmission, and is recommended for all adolescents and young adults via public health or in the primary care setting.
Infection with Ct, GC, trichomoniasis, and mycoplasma does not confer lifelong immunity, so re-infection is possible and common.
Prevention of STIs includes treating partners as well as using barrier protection during sexual activity.
When risk factors for STIs are identified, the patient should be appropriately counseled on risk reduction techniques.
Special Topics
Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT)
EPT is the treatment of the sex partners of patients who have been diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia by giving prescriptions to the patient. The patient then gives the prescription to the sex partner for treatment. Also called patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT).
Azithromycin or doxycycline for chlamydia
Cefixime with azithromycin for gonorrhea
Can be offered to patients with chlamydia or gonorrhoea if the provider cannot guarantee that the patient’s sex partners will also be treated (unless prohibited by local or state regulations).
Not routinely recommended for men who have sex with men because of a high number of co-infections including undiagnosed HIV. Data does not yet support this approach. 
Health counseling, treatment instructions, appropriate warnings, and medical follow-up/testing should be provided. 
Reduces the recurrent infection rate. 
Reporting of infections
Clinicians or lab technicians must report to the local health department according to local and state guidelines. In every state, new diagnoses of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, HIV, and AIDS are reportable. States may have additional reporting requirements.
Sex workers
STIs occur much more frequently in women who are sex workers than in non-sex workers. 
Sexual assault (See Chapter: Sexual Assault Evaluation)
Intrauterine devices (IUD) and PID:
Clinical trials and systematic reviews do not support any association between IUDs and an increased incidence of PID.
PID as a result of an IUD insertion is extremely rare, but women should be treated should the concern arise.
The CDC recommends that an IUD be kept in place during PID treatment except if the woman is known to have Actinomyces. If Actinomyces is suspected or confirmed, the IUD should be removed and the patient treated with penicillin or doxycycline. 
Women being treated for PID with an IUD should be re-evaluated in 48-72 h. If there are no signs of improvement, a TOA should be considered.",Gynecologic Infections
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
In cases of shock, resuscitate.
Activate massive transfusion protocol.
Reverse bleeding disorders, if present.
If there are no contraindications, give conjugated estrogen 25 mg IV every 4 h until bleeding stops (up to 24 h).
Consider tranexamic acid (TXA) 10 mg/kg (max 600 mg) IV or 1.3 g PO q8h for up to 5 d.
Place uterine tamponade device (eg, Bakri balloon).
Consult gynecology (GYN) immediately.
Consult interventional radiology (IR) immediately.

Key Concepts
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is the preferred term to describe a spectrum of symptoms such as heavy and irregular uterine bleeding.
AUB affects up to 14% of women during reproductive years.
Key ED management steps:
Assess hemodynamic stability.
Rule out pregnancy.
Temporize bleeding.
Ensure timely GYN follow-up.
The differential diagnosis of AUB can be broken down by age and into structural and non-structural causes:
Structural: Fibroids, adenomyosis, polyps
Non-structural: Ovulatory dysfunction, coagulopathy, malignancy
Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for pregnancy status and CBC are the 2 critical tests to perform in the ED.
A pelvic exam is necessary to rule out structural or traumatic causes of bleeding and to quantify bleeding.
Pelvic U/S is the imaging modality of choice but can usually be deferred to the outpatient setting.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a first-line treatment to decrease bleeding severity and cramping.
PITFALLS
Hormonal medications are an effective way to temporize bleeding. Many regimens exist. Options include:
Estrogen-containing combination oral contraceptive pill (if no contraindications)
1 pill PO q12h for 5 d and then 1 pill PO q24h until the pack is finished
Medroxyprogesterone acetate (if older or contraindication to estrogen)
10 mg PO q24h for 10 d
All patients should be referred for timely GYN follow-up, especially patients over 45 y of age to rule out endometrial cancer.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation: A 37-y-old female with a history of irregular periods presents with a complaint of heavy vaginal bleeding for the last 5 d associated with pelvic cramping, fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion. She denies the possibility of pregnancy.
Most common etiology of AUB in adolescents (13-18 y) is anovulation.
In this age group, 20%-30% of patients who require hospitalization or a blood transfusion secondary to heavy vaginal bleeding have a coagulopathy (most common is von Willebrand disease).
For women 19-39 y, structural lesions (fibroids, polyps) and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are common causes of AUB.
Cancer is uncommon but does occur. Risk of endometrial cancer increases with age (1.6% in women 20-34 y of age; 6.2% in women 35-44 y of age).
Postmenopausal women with abnormal bleeding should be considered to have cancer until proven otherwise.
Physical Exam
Make a note of vital signs, signs of anemia (pallor), or bleeding disorder (bruises, petechiae, signs of liver disease).
Bimanual exam
Confirm that the source of bleeding is vaginal.
Palpate uterus and note if enlarged/irregular to suggest fibroids or other masses.
Speculum exam
Look for signs of trauma.
Visualize the cervix to assess for friability, infection, polyps, or lesions suspicious for cancer.
Check for signs of thyroid disease (can lead to AUB), including thyroid gland enlargement or tenderness, tremor or lethargy, heat or cold intolerance, and abnormal reflexes.
Tests
Stable patients
Minimum ED tests: hCG and CBC.
Most will require a pelvic U/S; can usually be deferred as outpatient.
Endometrial biopsy (outpatient) is important for peri- and postmenopausal patients or those at high risk of endometrial cancer.
Patients with signs of shock or uncontrolled severe bleeding
hCG, CBC, coagulation studies, type and crossmatch, thyroid studies
Treatment
Stable patients
NSAIDs: Decrease cramping pain and bleeding by almost 50%.
Treat anemia: Iron supplementation with vitamin C (to help absorption).
Hormonal therapy with either monophasic oral contraceptives (combined estrogen/progestin) or progestin-only pills.
Estrogen is contraindicated in patients with a history of thrombosis (myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) or cancer or a high risk for cancer and in smokers or those attempting to become pregnant.
Unstable Patients or Those with Heavy Bleeding
If patient is in shock, resuscitate.
Immediate GYN and IR consultation.
Activate hospital massive transfusion protocol and initiate blood transfusion.
Correct coagulopathies, if present.
Give conjugated estrogen 25 mg IV q4h until bleeding stops (up to 24 h).
Consider TXA 10 mg/kg IV (max 600 mg) or 1.3 g orally.
Consider uterine tamponade device or vaginal packing.
Disposition
Home
The vast majority of patients with AUB can be discharged home with timely GYN follow-up once pregnancy and severe anemia have been ruled out.
Patients with significantly symptomatic anemia may need transfusion before discharge.
Admission
Anyone with severe, heavy, or uncontrolled bleeding should be seen by GYN in the ED; may need to go directly to the operating room (OR) for intervention or be admitted for observation and transfusion.
OR/Surgery
Patients with continued/uncontrolled bleeding will require emergency procedure by GYN or IR.
Emergency dilation and curettage (D&C) is the most common.
Emergency hysterectomy is indicated if D&C is not possible and the patient has life-threatening bleeding.
Arterial embolization by IR is a possibility, in consultation with GYN.
Risk Management Pearls
Rule out pregnancy in any woman of reproductive age, even if the patient states that pregnancy is not possible.
Document a thorough exam, including a speculum exam, to rule out structural abnormality or trauma and localize the bleeding as vaginal.
A subjective account of bleeding is unreliable; check CBC in all patients, even if the bleeding is reported to be light.
Early GYN consult is crucial for managing the unstable patient; include time-stamp in the chart.
Discharge instructions should include strict return precautions; for example, if bleeding increases or the patient is changing her pad more than once per hour.
Give clear, time-specific follow-up instructions for continued evaluation with GYN.
Postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding are at increased risk for malignancy; if timely follow-up with GYN is not possible, consider pelvic U/S in the ED.",Non-Pregnant Vaginal Bleeding

Background
AUB is a common complaint in the ED, and there are many different causes. AUB is the preferred term to describe a spectrum of symptoms such as heavy or irregular uterine bleeding. The term “dysfunctional uterine bleeding” is no longer recommended. Many experts also feel that other terms traditionally used to describe abnormal bleeding such as “menorrhagia,” “metrorrhagia,” and “menometrorrhagia” should also be abandoned. 
AUB affects up to 14% of women during their reproductive years. 
Normal bleeding parameters
Median age of menarche is 12.5 y.
Mean duration of menstrual bleeding is 4 d.
Average blood loss per menstruation is 35 mL.
Bleeding for more than 7 d or blood loss >80 mL is considered abnormal. 
Associated with heavy bleeding.
Changing pads/tampons a minimum of once every 3 h
Clots with a diameter >2.5 cm (1 inch)
Pathophysiology
In female neonates, minor hormonal withdrawal bleeding occurs between 10 d and 2 wk of life and is normal and self-limited. Aside from this, bleeding in a prepubertal girl is always abnormal and must be investigated.
The average age for menarche is 12-13 y, but menarche can occur as early as 10 y.
During the early teenage years, menstrual patterns are often irregular because of the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This results in persistent anovulation.
The normal menstruation cycle averages 28 d:
First 14 d: Follicular or proliferative phase; the endometrium becomes thick under the influence of increasing estrogen.
Second 14 d: Luteal or secretory phase; if no implantation of fertilized ovum has occurred, then the corpus luteum slows production of progesterone and involutes, causing sloughing of the endometrium as levels of estrogen and progesterone fall.
AUB occurs in the setting of ovulatory dysfunction because of the effects of chronic unopposed estrogen on the endometrium. 
Anovulation results in continual endometrial proliferation without progesterone withdrawal, induced shedding, and bleeding.
Anovulation results in bleeding that is non-cyclical, unpredictable, and inconsistent in volume.
Unopposed estrogen results in an endometrium that is fragile and vascular and lacks sufficient stromal support. 
Causes of anovulation
Physiologic
Adolescence
Perimenopause
Lactation
Pregnancy
Pathologic
Hyperandrogenic anovulation (PCOS, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-producing tumors)
Hypothalamic dysfunction (ie, anorexia nervosa)
Thyroid disease

Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Patients may present with heavy menstrual bleeding (formerly “menorrhagia”), which is defined as blood loss >80 mL per period. 
Patients may also present with intermenstrual bleeding (formerly “metrorrhagia”), which is defined as bleeding that occurs between otherwise normal menstrual periods. 
Bleeding more than 6 d in a row and/or changing a pad at least every 3 h is associated with significant blood loss.
ED clinicians must be vigilant for signs of hemodynamic compromise (tachycardia, hypotension) and symptoms of anemia (shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, lightheadedness, syncope, and near syncope) when evaluating patients with AUB.
It is important to obtain a thorough menstrual history including last menstrual period, onset of first menarche for adolescent patients, typical timing/regularity, and any previous episodes of heavy bleeding.
Many medications can contribute to AUB. It is critical to obtain a complete medication list, including any use of hormonal or contraceptive medications, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, anticoagulants, or steroids.
Pregnancy must be ruled out in all women of reproductive age presenting with AUB.
Trauma, sexual abuse, infection, suspected bleeding diathesis, and foreign bodies are conditions that should be ruled out in the ED through a combination of history and exam. 
It is helpful to consider a differential diagnosis by age:
Pre-puberty: Most commonly estrogen withdrawal bleeding (neonate) or vulvovaginitis in a child.
Vaginal foreign body, abuse, trauma, and tumor are other considerations in children.
External vaginal inspection should be performed, but internal exam may be deferred in this age group until further evaluation by pediatric GYN. 
Urethral prolapse is an uncommon finding in young girls, who may present with complaints of vaginal bleeding, which is typically light.
Average age is 5 y, and it is more common in black females.
Evident on exam: Distal urethral mucosa swells and pushes out through urethral orifice; donut-shaped mass anterior to the vaginal introitus. 
Adolescent (13-18 y)
The most common cause of AUB in adolescents is immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, which results in persistent anovulation.
However, it is important to obtain a thorough history to rule out bleeding disorders in adolescent patients presenting with AUB. Patients with bleeding disorders have typically experienced heavy bleeding since menarche. 
Up to 20% of adolescents presenting to the ED with heavy vaginal bleeding have von Willebrand disease. 
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and vaginitis can also cause irregular or bothersome bleeding in this population. (See Chapter: Gynecologic Infections)
19-39 y
Structural lesions such as cervical polyps and fibroids are common causes of AUB in women 19-39 y of age. The prevalence of both polyps and fibroids increases with age; up to 35% of women will eventually develop cervical polyps, and up to 80% will develop fibroids in their lifetime. 
PCOS is a common cause of irregular or heavy vaginal bleeding and can present with signs of androgen excess such as acne, hirsutism, alopecia, and obesity. 
PCOS affects 6% of women of reproductive age. 
Malignancy is uncommon but does occur. Both endometrial cancer and cervical cancer can present with vaginal bleeding in this age group. 
In one study, 56% of patients with cervical cancer presented with vaginal bleeding. 
Risk of endometrial cancer increases with age (1.6% in women 20-34 y; 6.2% in women 35-44 y).
Risk factors for endometrial cancer: Nulliparity, hypertension, body mass index >30, irregular menstruation, family history.
Vascular malformations are unusual causes of vaginal bleeding but can occur and be life-threatening. 
≥40 y
The mean age of menopause in developed countries is 51.4 y, and generally, the transition lasts 4 y. It is important to note that pregnancy is still possible until cessation of menstruation for one full year.
Postmenopausal women with AUB should be considered to have cancer until proven otherwise: 
Among women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding, 10% are diagnosed with endometrial cancer. 
For patients undergoing hysteroscopy for evaluation of vaginal bleeding, 4% of premenopausal women and 11% of postmenopausal women are ultimately diagnosed with endometrial cancer.
Women >45 y who present with suspected anovulatory uterine bleeding should be evaluated with endometrial biopsy as an outpatient.
The most common cause of AUB in postmenopausal women is endometrial atrophy. 
At least one-third of irregular cycles in mid-to-late menopause are due to disturbed ovulation cycles rather than anovulation, referred to as LOOP (luteal out of phase) cycles due to the development of a new preovulatory follicle during the preceding luteal phase. 
LOOP cycles are associated with heavy bleeding.
Truly anovulatory cycles are associated with the lightest bleeding.
Radiographic Evaluation
Pelvic U/S is the imaging study of choice for evaluation of AUB and generally can be deferred to the outpatient setting.
Pelvic U/S may demonstrate signs of endometrial cancer, endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, adenomyosis, uterine myomas, and fibroids.
If there is concern for cancer and timely GYN follow-up cannot be established, it is appropriate to perform the pelvic U/S in the ED.
Endometrial thickness is used to risk-stratify women as being at high or low risk for endometrial cancer:
Thickness <4 mm is considered very low risk for cancer. 
Before menopause, endometrial sonographic thickness measurements play no role in risk stratification because endometrial thickness changes throughout the menstrual cycle. 
Other outpatient tests may include saline infusion sonohysterography, which consists of endovaginal ultrasonography of the saline-filled uterus to better evaluate the endometrial lining for abnormalities. 
Additionally, hysteroscopy by a gynecologist can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in the treatment of AUB and is another reason to encourage patients to follow up as an outpatient.
Laboratory Evaluation
CBC is critical to evaluate for significant blood loss/anemia.
A pregnancy test is mandatory in all patients of reproductive age with a uterus.
Thyroid studies, liver profile, and coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio) may be helpful if the history or physical exam supports the suspicion of corresponding disorders.
In females of reproductive age with history or exam concerning for STIs, obtain tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and wet prep if available and consider presumptive treatment. (See Chapter: Gynecologic Infections)
If the patient is unstable or has signs/symptoms of anemia or if their bleeding is extremely heavy by history or exam, obtain type and screen and consider having blood cross-matched or activating the hospital’s massive transfusion protocol.
Therapeutic Considerations
The goal for the emergency medicine practitioner is to temporize an acute bleeding episode. Table Long-term management should be deferred to the patient’s gynecologist.
There is limited evidence to support treatment recommendations; most recommendations are based on expert opinion. 
Hormonal medications are currently the mainstay of treatment for AUB.
A Cochrane review did not identify any studies that met their criteria related to the use of progestogens with estrogen and progestin alone for the treatment of irregular menstrual bleeding, and they noted no consensus on which regimens are the most effective. 
Estrogen causes growth and stabilization of the endometrial vasculature and tissue and thus helps slow bleeding. Many regimens are available. Commonly used options include the following:
Hospitalized/unstable patients: Conjugated equine estrogens 25 mg IV q2-4h for 24 h until bleeding stops or subsides.  One randomized controlled trial of 34 women showed cessation of bleeding in 72% of patients within 8 h of administration compared with 38% of patients treated with a placebo. 
Outpatients: Oral estrogen 10 mg/d in 4 divided doses. 
Use of high-dose estrogen is often associated with nausea and vomiting; proactive prescribing of an antiemetic to be taken as needed is recommended. 
Contraindications to estrogen use include:
History of vascular disease (stroke, atherosclerosis, thromboembolism)
History of breast or endometrial cancer
Known inherited thrombophilia
Liver disease
Pregnancy
Severe uncontrolled hypertension (systolic over 160 mm Hg or diastolic over 100 mm Hg)
Women over 35 y who smoke
Caution should be taken when prescribing estrogen to women under 35 y who smoke, have mild to moderate hypertension, have migraine headaches, or have AUB of an unknown cause. However, many women in these groups can safely be treated with a short course of hormonal therapy from the ED until GYN follow-up. 
Oral progestin is a good option for women with contraindications to estrogen and is frequently used to control heavy bleeding. Common side effects of progestogens include headache, weight gain, and breast tenderness.
Cessation of bleeding with oral progestin generally occurs in 3-4 d. Progestin alone has a low risk for causing thrombosis. 
There are multiple dosing regimens and no consensus for which is best.
ACOG recommends medroxyprogesterone acetate 20 mg q8h for 7 d. 
Alternative regimen: Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg q24h for 10 d.
NSAIDs act by promoting vasoconstriction in the uterus and reducing endometrial prostaglandin levels. NSAIDs have been shown to decrease blood loss by 40%. 
NSAIDs have the added benefit of decreasing menstrual cramps.
There does not appear to be a difference between individual NSAIDs to effectively reduce bleeding. Some common regimens include:
Ibuprofen 200-800 mg (max 2400 mg/day) PO q8h or q6h for 5 d
Naproxen 500 mg PO initially, then 250 mg q8h or q6h for 5 d
NSAIDs should be avoided in the elderly, those with known or suspected bleeding disorders, patients with a history of renal dysfunction, or any patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleed.
TXA
Antifibrinolytic agents (plasminogen activator inhibitors) such as TXA have been used for decades in Europe to treat heavy menstrual bleeding.
In 2009, TXA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heavy vaginal bleeding.
TXA was found to be superior to placebo, NSAIDs, and oral progestins in decreasing blood loss associated with vaginal bleeding in a Cochrane review. 
Available evidence indicates that TXA is a safe and effective treatment for AUB, with no increased risk of thromboembolic disease or thrombosis. 
Recommended dose
1.3 g of TXA PO q8h for up to 5 d
Iron: Consider initiating oral iron supplementation in women with mild to moderate anemia consistent with iron deficiency or those at risk for ongoing blood loss. A common regimen is ferrous sulfate 300-325 mg PO q8h. 
Transfusion of packed red blood cells is indicated for any woman with active bleeding who is hemodynamically unstable or has a hemoglobin level <7 g/dL. 
Danazol is a synthetic steroid occasionally used by gynecologists to treat heavy uterine bleeding; it decreases uterine bleeding by inhibiting estrogen and progesterone receptors, causing endometrial atrophy.  It is not typically utilized in the ED.
Surgical treatment is rarely indicated in the treatment of heavy vaginal bleeding unless medical therapy fails or the patient has concomitant significant intracavitary lesions. 
D&C is the quickest surgical method to stop heavy bleeding from the uterine cavity but is not a permanent solution. Therefore, D&C is a common treatment option for patients with prolonged/heavy bleeding or for an unstable patient whose bleeding is not temporized by medical management; it is generally not useful in the long-term management of AUB. 
There are a variety of endometrial ablation procedures that can be used in an outpatient setting for chronic AUB not responsive to medical management, including hysteroscopic cautery, rollerball, laser vaporization, local hyperthermia, and radiofrequency ablation.
Hysterectomy is performed in cases of severe, recurrent heavy bleeding after other options have been exhausted and after consideration of loss of fertility.
Uterine or vaginal tamponade
If pharmacologic methods fail, a uterine balloon tamponade device can be placed to temporize bleeding. Commercial devices exist for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage (ie, Bakri balloon) but, if available, may also be used for the treatment of non-pregnant patients with heavy bleeding. The balloon is inserted through the cervix and inflated within the uterus. Foley catheters may be used in the same manner if a Bakri balloon in unavailable.
Another approach is to pack the vagina with long, continuous gauze.
Uterine balloons and vaginal µpacking may be left in place for up to 24 h. It is recommended that patients with balloons or packing be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent the theoretical risk of toxic shock syndrome, but there is no evidence to support this practice. 
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
Most patients with AUB can be treated in the ED and discharged home with GYN follow-up. Timely GYN follow-up for all patients is critical because the goal of the ED visit is to assess stability and to temporize an acute bleeding episode; it is not the role of the ED practitioner to necessarily determine the cause of the bleeding or to initiate long-term management. Thorough diagnostic testing and long-term management and prevention of bleeding should be deferred to the patient’s gynecologist.
Patients with excessive bleeding that cannot be temporized, severe anemia, or hemodynamic instability require admission and immediate GYN consult for further treatment and evaluation.
Prevention
Gynecologists have many tools in their armamentarium for the long-term treatment and prevention of AUB. These include monthly hormonal therapy, cyclic use of TXA, and the surgical options outlined above.
Additionally, the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (IUD) is gaining popularity as a treatment for AUB. This device is implanted within the uterus, where it may remain for up to 5 y; it acts by releasing a low dose of progesterone to locally suppress endometrial activity. The levonorgestrel IUD has been shown to reduce blood loss by up to 94%. ",Non-Pregnant Vaginal Bleeding
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Immediately consult Obstetrics (OB) and Neonatology/Pediatrics services.
If there is time, transfer the patient to Labor and Delivery (L&D).
If there is no time, prepare for delivery in the ED.
Place the patient in the lithotomy position.
Control delivery of the baby’s head.
Once the head is delivered, check for nuchal cord. If loose, attempt reduction by slipping it over the baby’s head.
Place hands on either side of the baby’s face, pinkies to the perineum.
Apply downward and outward traction to deliver the anterior shoulder, then upward and outward traction to deliver the posterior shoulder.
Support the delivery of the rest of the baby’s body.
If the infant is vigorous, keep the infant at the level of the perineum for 30-60 s after delivery. Subsequently clamp the umbilical cord 3 cm from insertion and again 4-5 cm from the first clamp. Cut the cord between the clamps using sterile scissors.
Place the baby on the mother’s chest, skin-to-skin.
Resuscitate the baby and mother if unstable.
Audio Board Review of Maternity Topics EM:RAP Audio
Key Concepts
Precipitous delivery is defined as labor that lasts no more than 3 h from the onset of regular contractions to birth.
The majority of ED deliveries are of a single fetus in cephalic (head-first) presentation, resulting in good outcomes for both the mother and baby.
If a nuchal cord is encountered, it will most likely be loose and not impede delivery.
PITFALLS
According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), a pregnant patient experiencing true contractions is considered unstable until both the baby and the placenta have been delivered.
Labor is unpredictable; clinical judgement is required to determine whether there is time to transfer the patient prior to delivery. If the fetus is crowning or if the cervix is fully effaced and dilated, delivery is imminent.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: A pregnant patient presents to the ED experiencing contractions that began 2 h prior. This is her fourth pregnancy, and the patient thought she had more time to get to the hospital, but is now experiencing regular contractions every 2 min. She reports that she feels an urge to push. On vaginal examination, the fetus is crowning.
The time from the onset of regular contractions to complete cervical effacement and dilation is an average of 8 h in nulliparous women and 5 h in multiparous women.
The incidence of reported precipitous deliveries is 3-14%.
In 95% of deliveries, the presenting part is the occiput.
Nuchal cords are common, occurring in up to 29% of births.
Treatment
If necessary, resuscitate.
Activate a multi-disciplinary team including OB, Neonatology, and/or Pediatrics.
If there is time, transfer the patient to the L&D unit for delivery by OB.
If delivery is imminent or in progress, prepare for delivery in the ED.
Place the patient in the lithotomy position.
Control delivery of the head.
Once the head is delivered, check for nuchal cord. If the nuchal cord is loose, attempt to reduce by slipping the cord over the baby’s head.
Once the cord is reduced, place hands on either side of the baby’s face, pinkies to the perineum.
Apply downward and outward traction to deliver the anterior shoulder, then upward and outward traction to deliver the posterior shoulder.
Support the delivery of the rest of the baby’s body.
If the infant is vigorous, keep the infant at the level of the perineum for 30-60 s after delivery. Subsequently clamp the umbilical cord 3 cm from insertion and again 4-5 cm from the first clamp. Cut the cord between the clamps using sterile scissors.
Place the baby on the mother’s chest, skin-to-skin.
Resuscitate the baby and mother, if necessary.
Disposition
Admission
Patients presenting in active labor should not be discharged.
If delivery is not imminent, transfer the patient to L&D.
If delivery occurs in the ED, the mother should be transferred to L&D unit once stabilized. The baby should be admitted to the newborn nursery if stable; if unstable, the baby will require admission to neonatal ICU (NICU).
After delivery of the placenta, the patient is no longer considered unstable according to EMTALA and can be transferred if there was insufficient time prior to delivery.
Charting Pearls
If there is time, obtain and document the mother’s prenatal care course, prior obstetric history, and other pertinent historical factors leading up to the time of delivery.
Document and time-stamp consultation with OB or attempts to contact the OB on-call.
If transferring the patient, repeat and document a vaginal assessment immediately prior to the patient leaving the ED. Labor may progress significantly during arrangement of the transfer.
If possible, estimate and record the baby’s Apgar score.",Normal Vaginal Delivery
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
Precipitous delivery is defined as labor that lasts no more than 3 h from the onset of regular contractions to birth. 
The incidence of reported precipitous deliveries is 3-14%. 
Unplanned ‘out of hospital’ (OOH) birth and ‘birth before arrival’ (BBA) are terms for a birth that occurs before arrival at the hospital or before arrival of a midwife at a planned home birth. These definitions often include deliveries occurring in hospitals but in inappropriate locations such as the ED. 
OOH and BBA deliveries are associated with higher rates of maternal and fetal complications. Maternal complications include higher rates of perineal tears, retained placenta, and postpartum hemorrhage. Fetal complications include increased risk of hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and jaundice, resulting in a higher risk of admission to NICU. 
OOH and BBA are more common in term, multiparous patients and are more likely to occur at night between the hours of 2200 and 0600. 
Pathophysiology
Normal labor proceeds through 3 stages:
Stage 1 (cervical stage): Starts with the onset of regular contractions and ends with complete cervical effacement and dilatation. This stage lasts an average of 8 h in nulliparous women and 5 h in multiparous women. 
Stage 2 (expulsion stage): Begins once the cervix is completely effaced and dilated and continues until delivery of the fetus. This stage has a wide range of mean durations and is influenced by parity. The mean range is 36-57 min for nulliparous women and 17-19 min for multiparous women. 
Stage 3 (placental stage): Begins after delivery of the fetus and ends with separation and delivery of the placenta.
Most patients who present to the ED in labor are in stage 1 or early stage 2. The length of these stages usually allows enough time for the patient to be transferred to a nearby L&D unit; however, emergency physicians must be prepared to proceed with delivery in the ED if birth is imminent. 
Abnormally low resistance of the birth canal, abnormally strong contractions, a lack of awareness of painful sensations, or any combination of these conditions can contribute to precipitous delivery.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Signs and symptoms of true labor include regular contractions, back pain, abdominal pain, pelvic cramping or pressure, vomiting, and bleeding (bloody show). False labor is defined as uterine contractions that do not lead to cervical changes (Braxton Hicks contractions). 
Clinical signs and symptoms that suggest delivery is imminent include the fetus visibly emerging (crowning), contractions occurring less than 2 min apart, maternal urge to push, and perineal distention or labial separation with contractions.
Radiographic Evaluation
U/S is the most useful radiographic tool for the patient presenting in active labor. If there is time, U/S can be used to determine fetal heart rate, gestational age, and presentation and can also confirm the location of the placenta.
Laboratory Evaluation
Laboratory tests do not play a role in the diagnosis or management of precipitous vaginal delivery.
Patients presenting in active labor should have basic labs checked, including a CBC, coagulation profile, and blood type and screen.
Therapeutic Considerations
Before Delivery (Stage 1)
If time allows, begin by obtaining as much history as possible, including prenatal care, frequency of contractions, loss of fluid, bleeding, and presence of fetal movement.
Confirm the gestational age of the fetus and estimated due date. If the due date or gestational age is unknown, the last menstrual period can be used for a rough calculation. Uterine fundal height can also provide a quick estimate of gestational age. In general, the fundus can be palpated at the level of the umbilicus at 20 wk and grows 1 cm every wk until 36 wk, when the fetus drops into the pelvis. If available, bedside U/S can also be used to estimate gestational age.
A sterile vaginal examination must be performed to determine the stage of labor and whether delivery is imminent. The cervix must be assessed for effacement and dilation. A cervix that is 100% effaced should feel paper-thin. A fully dilated cervix measures 10 cm.
If the patient has a history of placenta previa or if previa is suspected, do not perform a digital cervical exam, as this could precipitate life-threatening hemorrhage. (See Chapter: Emergencies After 20 Weeks)
The information obtained during pelvic assessment can help to gauge the likelihood that delivery is imminent and determine whether there is time to transfer the patient to an L&D unit. If the fetus is crowning, there is not enough time to transfer, and the baby should be delivered in the ED. If the patient’s cervix is fully effaced and dilated, delivery should probably occur in the ED unless the L&D unit is very close (onsite). Any other scenario requires clinical judgment and weighing of the risks and benefits of transfer. 
The EMTALA is a law that governs when and how a patient may be transferred from one hospital to another when in an unstable medical condition. According to EMTALA, pregnant patients having true contractions are considered unstable until both the infant and placenta have been delivered. However, if the patient is determined to be at a stage of labor during which “safe transfer” can be accomplished, they may be transferred to another facility. Moreover, an “appropriate transfer” (transfer before the patient is considered stable) may occur if the patient “has been treated at the transferring hospital and stabilized as far as possible within the limits of its capabilities; and the patient needs treatment at the receiving facility, and the medical risks of transfer are outweighed by the medical benefits.” 
Vaginal Delivery (Stage 2)
Normal delivery consists of 6 cardinal movements: Engagement, flexion, descent, internal rotation, extension, and external rotation.
The patient should be placed in the lithotomy position.
As the fetus descends, the perineum stretches around the fetal head. Performing firm digital stretching of the perineum may help to prevent maternal tears.
Once the cervix is fully dilated and effaced, the mother can safely push for three 10-s intervals with each contraction.
The fetal head should be controlled (but not restrained) as it emerges from the introitus to help prevent tears from rapid delivery. With one hand, support the perineum by placing a sterile towel along the inferior perineum; support the fetal head with the other hand.
As the baby’s head emerges, the inferior hand should support the baby’s chin, while the superior hand remains on the occiput.
Palpate the baby’s neck to check for the presence of a nuchal cord. Nuchal cord is defined as the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby’s neck 360°. Nuchal cords are common, occurring in up to 29% of births.  If present and loose, simply bring the loop over the baby’s head to reduce. Alternatively, the baby can be delivered and the cord unwound afterwards. A tight nuchal cord that cannot be reduced and is impeding delivery can be clamped in two places and cut in between. However, this should only be performed as a last resort, since this intervention has been associated with serious fetal complications such as hypovolemia, anemia, shock, hypoxic−ischemic encephalopathy, and cerebral palsy. 
As the head delivers, it will turn to one side. Once the baby’s head is turned, place hands on either side of the head, while providing very gentle downward and outward traction to deliver the anterior shoulder. This traction should be gentle to avoid brachial plexus injuries.
Once the anterior shoulder is delivered, guide the head upwards and outwards to help deliver the posterior shoulder, followed by the rest of the baby’s body.
Traditionally, the infant’s mouth and then nose are suctioned; however, in the vigorous newborn, this practice is being called into question.
The vigorous infant can be kept at the level of the perineum for 30-60 s after delivery, allowing for delayed cord clamping. Subsequently clamp the umbilical cord 3 cm from insertion and again 4-5 cm from the first clamp. Cut the cord between the clamps using sterile scissors.
The infant should be kept warm and stimulated by being wrapped in a blanket and, if stable, placed on the mother’s chest, skin-to-skin.
After Delivery (Stage 3)
Signs that the placenta has separated from the uterine wall include spontaneous lengthening of the umbilical cord and a gush of blood from the vagina. 
The placenta may spontaneously deliver to the introitus, where it may be gently grasped and extracted.
If the placenta does not spontaneously deliver, gentle traction may be applied to the cord. Aggressive traction increases the risk of umbilical cord tearing, placental injury, and uterine inversion.
The median time to delivery of the placenta is 5-7 min after delivery of the infant; approximately 75% of placentas are delivered within 6 min. 
If delivery of the placenta takes longer than 18 min, there is a significant risk of postpartum hemorrhage. After 30 min, the odds of postpartum hemorrhage are 6 times higher than before 30 min. 
Active management of the third stage of labor, including controlled cord traction and prophylactic administration of a uterotonic agent, can significantly decrease the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. (See Chapter: Complicated Delivery and Postpartum Complications)
Once the placenta is delivered, it should be thoroughly examined to check for any missing pieces that may be retained in the uterus.
Firmly massage the uterus to stimulate contractions. Using a good light source, inspect the entire perineum for tears or lacerations that may require repair.
Care of Patients After Successful Precipitous Vaginal Delivery
Once stabilized, the mother and baby will require admission. The mother should be transferred to L&D. If the pregnancy was term, the baby should be admitted to the newborn nursery once stable; if unstable or preterm, the baby will require admission to NICU. This may require transfer to a hospital with the appropriate level NICU.",Normal Vaginal Delivery
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Prioritize resuscitation of the mother.
Do not withhold a necessary test or treatment out of concern for the fetus.
If >20 wk gestation, place the patient in left lateral tilt position or manually displace the uterus to the left.
Treat hypotension and shock in the typical manner.
In cases of cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and resuscitation should follow advanced cardiac life support guidelines.
Anticipate a difficult airway.
Pre-oxygenate and expect the patient to quickly desaturate.
Have suction ready in case of vomiting.
Prepare a smaller endotracheal tube (6.5-7.5 mm in diameter).
Administer typical rapid sequence intubation (RSI) medications; there are no contraindications in pregnancy.
Administer Rho(D) immune globulin 300 μg IM in Rh-negative mothers.
Call Obstetrics (OB) department.
Key Concepts
The maternal physiology and anatomy changes and adapts throughout pregnancy.
Cardiovascular changes are dynamic in pregnancy. Both the stroke volume and heart rate increase, resulting in an increase in cardiac output. The blood pressure usually decreases, reaching its lowest point between 24 and 28 weeks.
In early pregnancy, the uterus receives 3-6% of the maternal cardiac output, peaking at 450-750 mL/min at term. Uterine trauma or bleeding may result in rapid, life-threatening hemorrhage.
Signs of hypovolemia and hemorrhage, such as significant tachycardia and hypotension, may be late findings in pregnancy due to the increase in maternal blood volume.
The minute ventilation increases in pregnancy, while the total lung capacity (TLC), expiratory reserve volume, and functional residual capacity decrease. Clinically, this change can manifest as dyspnea, and pregnant patients are more prone to desaturation.
PITFALLS
The abdominal exam changes during pregnancy due to the displacement of abdominal organs by an enlarging uterus and stretching of the peritoneum. Pregnant patients are at higher risk for gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, aspiration, gallstone formation, and cholecystitis.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs), pyelonephritis, and kidney stones are more common in pregnancy.
Increased insulin production and insulin resistance from human placental lactogen (hPL) can lead to the development of gestational diabetes.
Pregnant patients are at higher risk for thromboembolism due to changes in coagulation factors meant to protect the mother from hemorrhaging during delivery.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation: A 30-y-old obviously gravid female presents with a heart rate of 102, respiratory rate of 22, and worsening dyspnea on exertion with mild peripheral edema. The oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.
The physiologic changes that occur with pregnancy may affect virtually any organ system and can confound the clinical evaluation of these patients.
Normal pregnancy may cause symptoms that mimic pathophysiologic conditions. Clinicians need to be aware of what constitutes a normal change associated with pregnancy and symptoms that are not consistent with these changes and may therefore represent pathology.
Tests
Many laboratory tests change with pregnancy.
Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis occur with pregnancy.
Coagulation factors increase in pregnancy.
B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are not affected by pregnancy. 
Troponin is not altered in normal pregnancy.
The gravid uterus should be shielded when performing imaging studies that use ionizing radiation.
The enlarged uterus in the 3rd trimester may prevent full inspiration when obtaining a chest X-ray.
Spirometry results are not altered in pregnancy.
ECG changes expected in pregnancy may include left axis deviation, prominent Q waves in II, III, and avF, and flattened or inverted T waves in leads III and V1-V3.
Treatment
If the patient is in shock, resuscitate using IV fluids and blood based on typical indications.
Patients >20 wk gestation may benefit from being placed in the left lateral tilt position or from manual displacement of the uterus to the left in order to improve venous return.
Administer Rho(D) immune globulin 300 μg IM to Rh-negative patients with bleeding.
Immediate OB consultation.
Hypoxic patients should receive supplemental oxygen.
If intubation is necessary, assume a high risk for aspiration and prepare for a difficult airway.
Disposition
Admission
In general, indications for admission for pregnant patients are similar to those for non-pregnant patients with a few exceptions:
Pregnant patients with pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or severe hypertension (>160/110) should be admitted to an OB unit.
Patients with pre-eclampsia are usually admitted.
Discharge
Pregnant patients that are hemodynamically stable can usually be discharged home after consultation with OB.
Charting Pearls
Document discussion with OB.
Note in the chart any changes in vital signs, exam findings, or laboratory results that may be abnormal but expected due to the physiologic and anatomic changes expected in pregnancy.",Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy
"Deep Dive
Background
Pregnancy is a time of heightened metabolic activity requiring physiological adaptation to supply the fetus with nutrients necessary for fetal growth and development.
Each organ system is affected by a cascade of neural, hormonal, and anatomic changes, resulting in changes on the physical exam as well as the possible development of pathologic conditions.
It is crucial that the emergency physician understand the normal physiologic changes in pregnancy in order to recognize acute pathology.
Cardiovascular
As early as 5 wk after conception, the maternal cardiovascular system begins adapting to provide adequate blood flow to the developing fetus.
Initially, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) begins to decrease due to increased levels of estrogen, progesterone, and prostaglandins; this vasodilation leads to a lower systemic blood pressure (BP). 
SVR continues to decrease until the middle of the 2nd trimester, while the heart rate steadily increases throughout gestation until term.
The SVR decreases by approximately 35-40% while the heart rate increases by approximately 24% throughout pregnancy, leading to an average increase of 1.5 L/min of cardiac output over the pre-pregnancy value. 
This change benefits the developing maternal-fetal circulation; near the end of pregnancy, the uterine blood flow increases from 5.6% to 11.7%. 
The stroke volume also increases throughout pregnancy due to vasodilation-mediated increases in renin activity, causing an increase in cardiac output and plasma volume. 
As the uterus grows and intra-abdominal pressure increases throughout the 2nd trimester, compression on vascular structures (inferior vena cava, aorta) can lead to a decreased venous return and resultant relative hypotension, especially when the patient is supine. 
Respiratory
Throughout pregnancy, progesterone increases the sensitivity of the respiratory center to CO2, therefore increasing the tidal volume and, to a lesser degree, the respiratory rate. 
This change leads to an increase in minute ventilation but can also lead to the development of dyspnea, which can be progressive throughout pregnancy. 
Maternal hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis (decreased PaCO2), facilitating the transmission of fetal CO2 to the maternal circulation. 
Respiratory alkalosis leads to increased renal excretion of bicarbonate, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve leftward and facilitating maternal-to-fetal oxygen transmission. 
As the gravid uterus grows, intra-abdominal pressure displaces the diaphragm upwards, decreasing the TLC. 
Outward flaring of the ribs and decreased chest wall compliance also contributes to the decrease in TLC and functional reserve capacity. 
Spirometry is not significantly altered in pregnancy. 
Hematologic
Erythropoietin levels increase in pregnancy, stimulating red blood cell production.
This change is contingent on adequate maternal stores of iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12. 
A proportional increase in plasma volume (1-1.5 L on average) mediated by renin:angiotensin leads to a dilutional anemia of approximately 1-2 g/dL. 
Platelet production increases during pregnancy, but the dilutional effects of increased plasma volume and increased platelet consumption yield a relative thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. 
Estrogen stimulates the production of neutrophils and results in an increased white blood cell (WBC) count. 
Increased estrogen levels promote protein synthesis, thereby increasing the production of factors VII, VIII, IX, and XII, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor by 20-200% in pregnancy. 
This hypercoagulable state of pregnancy increases the overall risk of thromboembolism but is thought to mitigate the risk of hemorrhage during delivery. 
Renal
The renal flow and GFR increase in pregnancy throughout the 1st trimester, largely due to an increased cardiac output and systemic vasodilation. 
Activation of the renin:angiotensin:aldosterone axis due to a decrease in SVR leads to volume expansion via increased water and sodium reabsorption. 
Disproportionate reabsorption of water over sodium leads to a decreased plasma osmolality and mild asymptomatic hyponatremia (sodium [Na] levels still above 130). 
Creatinine levels decrease, while urinary protein, albumin, and glucose excretion increase. 
Proteinuria increases 50-100% by the 2nd trimester, but should not exceed 300 mg/d.
Proteinuria >300 mg/d is concerning for pre-eclampsia. (See Chapter: Emergencies After 20 Weeks Gestation)
The increase in GFR throughout pregnancy may affect the renal clearance of some medications. 
Progesterone leads to dilation of the renal calyces, pelvis, and ureters.
This dilation combined with ureteral compression by an enlarged uterus results in hydronephrosis.
Increased urinary stasis from relaxation of the ureteric smooth muscle increases the risk of UTIs, pyelonephritis, and kidney stones in pregnancy. 
Gastrointestinal
As pregnancy progresses, the enlarging uterus and stretching of the peritoneum can displace anatomic structures and the location of typical landmarks, which can alter the abdominal exam.
Increased gastrin production and a decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone secondary to progesterone predispose pregnant patients to gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, and aspiration. 
Progesterone-mediated increases in gastric emptying times and increased gastric transit times may result in nausea, vomiting, bloating, and constipation. 
Smooth muscle relaxation decreases gallbladder contractility, which can lead to increased gallstone formation, biliary colic, and cholecystitis.
Cholecystitis is the second most common non-OB surgical emergency during pregnancy, after appendicitis. 
Liver enzyme (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels are generally unaltered or decreased during pregnancy, while alkaline phosphatase levels are increased. 
Endocrine
In pregnancy, the levels of multiple hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, increase. The placenta secretes relaxin, hPL, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG. 
Increased insulin production from β-islet cell hyperplasia and insulin resistance from HPL can manifest as gestational diabetes. 
The thyroid gland increases in size due to hyperplasia, and hCG can stimulate thyroid-stimulating hormone, leading to transient hyperthyroidism. 
Skin
Hyperpigmentation is the most common skin change noted in pregnancy. Estrogen and progesterone can cause melanocyte proliferation/hyperstimulation, primarily in previously hyperpigmented areas such as the areola, axilla, genitals, and inner thighs.  Generalized hyperpigmentation should raise suspicion for a secondary etiology.
Melasma occurs in up to 75% of pregnant women, usually in a malar/mandibular region.
Estrogen levels can lead to vascular proliferation and dilation in the form of spider angiomas, telectangasias, and pyogenic granulomas in pregnancy. 
Vascular compression by the gravid uterus can compress the pelvic and femoral vasculature, contributing to varicose veins. 
There are multiple dermatoses of pregnancy involving pruritus (pruritic urticarial papules/plaques in pregnancy, pruritic folliculitis in pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis). This condition typically targets the scalp, anus vulva, and abdominal skin.  Non-pregnancy-related causes of pruritus should be considered as well.
Diagnostic Considerations
Cardiovascular
Clinical Presentation
Cardiovascular changes in pregnancy can manifest clinically as peripheral edema, mild tachycardia, jugular venous distention, and lateral displacement of the left ventricular apex. 
New murmurs, both flow (due to increased cardiac output) and regurgitant (due to dilatation of the cardiac valves), may be present. 
Check the BP of every pregnant patient. Expect a lower BP than the pre-pregnancy state. A BP above 140/90 after 20 weeks gestation warrants further investigation for pre-eclampsia. (See Chapter: Emergencies After 20 Weeks Gestation)
Symptomatic hypertension (headache, chest pain, visual changes) necessitates IV antihypertensives and magnesium to prevent progression to eclampsia, which can be life-threatening for the mother and fetus.  (See Chapter: Emergencies After 20 Weeks Gestation)
The heart rate may be slightly increased, but if the heart rate is significantly higher than baseline, prompt evaluation should be performed for hypovolemia or pathologic vasodilation (hemorrhage, sepsis).
Radiographic, ECG, and Imaging Evaluation
If possible, the gravid abdomen should be shielded when obtaining a chest X-ray.
Later in pregnancy, displacement of the heart upwards and to the left by an elevated diaphragm may lead to ECG changes such as a left axis deviation, prominent Q waves in inferior leads (II, III, avF), or flattened/inverted waves in anteroseptal precordial leads (V1-V3). 
Echocardiogram is safe in pregnancy and is a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating cardiac symptoms and monitoring cardiac conditions. Both the left and right ventricular ejection fractions remain unchanged in normal pregnancy. The increased cardiac output and blood volume in pregnancy lead to dilation of the heart, yielding an increased left ventricular dimension and wall thickness. The increased preload also results in an increased right ventricular dimension. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Troponin is the most sensitive and specific marker of myocardial damage in pregnancy. As for non-pregnant patients, consider non-acute coronary syndrome causes of troponin elevation and myocardial strain, including pulmonary embolism, septic shock, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, heart failure, intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, and hypertensive emergencies. 
CK-MB is synthesized by the uterus and placenta and can therefore be detected in healthy pregnant women without myocardial damage. 
BNP levels remain normal throughout normal pregnancies. 
If BP >140/90 after 20 wk gestation, the patient should be evaluated for pre-eclampsia.
Obtain UA to evaluate for proteinuria (300 mg protein in a 24-h urine sample, protein:creatinine ratio >0.3, or dipstick protein 1+ or greater).
Perform CBC to evaluate for thrombocytopenia (<100,000).
Obtain LFTs to assess for transaminitis (LFTs twice the pre-pregnancy value).
Perform BMP to evaluate creatinine (>1.1 or twice the pre-pregnancy norm, LFTs twice the pre-pregnancy value).
Respiratory
Clinical Presentation
Physiologic dyspnea in pregnancy should not be associated with fever, cough, chest pain, focal findings on auscultation, or hypoxia. These findings should prompt further evaluation.
In patients with a known history of asthma or any obstructive lung disease, spirometry results (FEV1) should not be affected by pregnancy. Spirometry can be a useful tool to assess the severity of exacerbation or to monitor the response to beta-agonist therapy.
Radiographic Evaluation
Uterine distention during pregnancy results in an elevation of the diaphragm that can be seen on chest X-ay. A broadened cardiac silhouette and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature are also expected due to an increased blood volume and cardiac output. Pulmonary edema and cephalization are abnormal findings in pregnancy.
Laboratory Evaluation
D-dimer levels rise steadily throughout pregnancy, which can confound the utility of D-dimer levels in the evaluation of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  A negative D-dimer test in pregnant patients with a low pretest probability of VTE is still reliably negative; however, this result is less likely to be obtained, especially as pregnancy progresses.  For this reason, some investigators do not recommend D-dimer testing for the assessment of VTE in pregnant patients, while others support the use of adjusted trimester-specific D-dimer thresholds.  Trimester-adjusted D-dimer levels have not yet been validated.
For the arterial blood gas, the pH remains relatively constant during pregnancy. Increases in the minute ventilation and oxygen consumption raise the PaO2 and decrease the PaCO2, resulting in mild respiratory alkalosis, which is partially compensated by an increase in bicarbonate excretion, yielding a low HCO3. 
Hematologic
Clinical Presentation
Both mild anemia and thrombocytopenia can be expected in pregnancy.
Pregnant patients often feel fatigued; anemia may contribute to this condition.
Routine prescription of prenatal vitamins (with iron and folate) should be provided as early as possible in pregnancy. If the pregnancy is first diagnosed in the ED, educate patients about the importance of prenatal vitamins and initiate prenatal vitamin therapy.
Laboratory Evaluation
Perform a CBC. Most often, anemia is dilutional but may also be due to a relative iron deficiency. Anemia with hemoglobin (Hgb) <10 g/dL or with a normal ferritin level should prompt investigation into other causes such as thalessemia or sickle cell. Oral iron can be administered for mild cases of iron-deficiency anemia (Hgb ~11.5 g/dL), but severe anemia (Hgb <8.5 g/dL with ferritin <30) warrants IV iron, which does not need to be administered in the ED. 
Estrogen-stimulated production of neutrophils and the resulting increased WBC count can confound the use of WBCs in evaluating for infection. 
Thrombocytopenia may appear in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. Platelet counts are typically greater than 100,000 × 109/L. Platelet counts below 80,000 × 109/L or thrombocytopenia in the 1st trimester should prompt investigation into other etiologies (immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pre-eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets [HELLP] syndrome). 
Pregnancy is considered a hypercoagulable state; thus, clinicians should have a high suspicion for vaso-occlusive disease (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cavernous venous thrombosis). However, routine coagulation studies are not needed and should not be markedly abnormal.
Renal
Clinical Presentation
Relaxation of the uretic smooth muscle can lead to urinary stasis and increased risk of UTIs, pyelonephritis, and kidney stones. 
Increased urinary frequency and urgency may result from external uterine compression or UTI.
Radiographic Evaluation
Hydronephrosis is expected due to progesterone-mediated dilation of the renal calyx, pelvis, and ureters in combination with mechanical compression of the ureters by an enlarging uterus. This condition is more prevalent on the right side. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Asymptomatic bacteriuria and concern for its progression to symptomatic UTI or pyelonephritis are more prevalent in pregnancy due to anatomic and physiologic changes in the urinary system. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant patients should be treated.
Glycosuria in pregnancy is common due to the increased GFR; therefore, routine screening is not recommended.
Proteinuria is defined as the excretion of ≥300 mg of protein over a 24-hour collection or over 1+ on a dipstick. The quantity of proteinuria is no longer used in the classification of severe pre-eclampsia. 
Gastrointestinal
Clinical Presentation
Increased gastrin production leads to a decreased gastric pH, decreased gastric transit time, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and decreased LES tone, resulting in an increased risk for gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, and aspiration. Patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, bloating, and constipation. 
Decreased gallbladder contractility due to smooth muscle relaxation leads to biliary stasis and increased gallstone formation. Cholecystitis is the second most common non-OB surgical emergency during pregnancy, after appendicitis. 
Persistent epigastric or right upper quadrant pain should prompt concern for acute fatty liver in pregnancy, biliary obstruction, pre-eclampsia, or HELLP syndrome. 
Radiologic Evaluation
Right upper quadrant U/S is a safe and useful modality for evaluation of the gallbladder in pregnancy.
Bedside right upper quadrant U/S with visualization of free fluid in Morison’s pouch can reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment in cases of suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy. 
Laboratory Evaluation
LFTs should not be increased in pregnancy. Therefore, transaminitis is considered pathologic and should prompt evaluation for acute fatty liver in pregnancy, biliary obstruction, pre-eclampsia, or HELLP syndrome. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Cardiovascular
If the BP is >160/110, initiate anti-hypertensives. If the BP is within 140-160/90-110 and the patient is symptomatic with headache, chest pain, or visual changes, consult OB, as these patients will need treatment for their hypertension in the ED. If the BP is within 140-160/90-110 and the patient is asymptomatic, the patient should be referred for weekly BP monitoring.
If the BP is greater than or equal to 140/90 and the patient is >20 weeks pregnant, evaluate for pre-eclampsia (urine dipstick vs. 24-hour urine collection, 300 mg/24 h). Obtain UA in the ED (and as an outpatient) to delineate between gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Obtain a CBC to evaluate for anemia or thrombocytopenia and LFTs to assess for transaminitis (HELLP syndrome). Any evidence of hemolysis or thrombocytopenia <100,000 × 109/L may require corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity in anticipation of early delivery. 
Hydralazine, labetalol, and oral nifedipine can be used for acute management of BP in pregnancy. 
Respiratory
Beta-agonist therapy and prednisone are recommended for patients with known asthma and symptoms consistent with exacerbation. 
All pregnant patients requiring intubation should be approached as having a potentially difficult airway. Upper airway changes in pregnancy, including hyperemia, edema, and increased secretions, challenge airway management. Additionally, pregnant patients are at higher risk for desaturation. A smaller endotracheal tube (6.5-7.5 mm in diameter) is recommended for intubation, and the first attempt should be made by the most experienced physician.
Hematologic
Low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin) is the recommended treatment for pregnant women with VTE without renal dysfunction. Unfractionated heparin is preferred in cases of renal dysfunction (GFR <30 mL/min) and for cases in which delivery and surgery are imminent. Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy, as it has been associated with birth defects. Novel oral anticoagulants should be avoided in pregnancy, as they likely cross the placenta and have not been adequately studied. 
Renal
Treat asymptomatic bacteruria and acute cystitis, as these increase the maternal risk for pyelonephritis. Cephalosporins and carbapenems are considered safe throughout pregnancy. Conflicting research exists regarding the possible increased risk of stillbirth and birth defects with bactrim and nitrofurantoin for the 1st trimester only; therefore, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) currently suggests using an alternative antibiotic choice if possible. 
Renally dosed medications may be excreted at higher rates due to the increased GFR in pregnancy, which decreases their therapeutic efficacy. 
Gastrointestinal
First-line treatment for nausea includes vitamin B6, doxylamine, and diphenhydramine followed by typical therapies (ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine).  (See Chapter: Emergencies Before 20 Weeks Gestation)
Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with the standard therapies of Maalox and famotidine is safe in pregnancy.",Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Perform a primary advanced trauma life support survey.
Perform a focused musculoskeletal (MSK) examination of the upper extremities.
Examination and documentation must include thorough assessment of neurovascular status.
Dysvascular limbs should prompt urgent consultation to orthopedics and vascular surgery.
If caused by fracture or dislocations, provisional reduction should be performed with reassessment of vascular status following reduction.
Obtain plain films of the injured joint or extremity and the joints above and below the injured bone.
Consult Orthopedic Surgery for:
Traumatic amputation, mangled extremity, or traumatic arthrotomy
Dysvascular extremity requiring skeletal stabilization
Acute compartment syndrome (ACS)
Open fracture
Fracture-dislocation
Posterior sternoclavicular (SC) dislocation
Other upper extremity MSK injuries, depending on institutional protocol, practice setting, and provider comfort level
For an open fracture:
Administer appropriate antibiotics and update tetanus immunization (See: Treatment section).
Obtain X-rays of the injured bone and the joints above and below the injured bone.
Consult Orthopedic Surgery.
At the discretion of Orthopedic Surgery:
Irrigate wound with normal saline and remove gross debris, leaving any bone fragments in place.
Apply a sterile saline-soaked bandage.
Apply a well-padded splint after X-rays are obtained.
Patients with traumatic amputation, dysvascular extremity, and ACS require emergency surgery.
Key Concepts
Upper extremity MSK trauma includes injury to the appendicular skeleton and its surrounding soft tissues from the SC joint to the wrist.
Blunt force is the most common mechanism of injury.
The assessment of upper extremity MSK trauma requires a focused MSK and neurovascular examination and appropriate radiographic imaging.
In the polytrauma or obtunded patient, upper extremity injuries can be missed. Maintain a high index of suspicion if there are signs of injury such as deformity, swelling, ecchymosis or lacerations.
Plain radiographs are generally sufficient for an initial evaluation of upper extremity MSK trauma.
The most important factor in preventing infection in open fractures is the time to antibiotic delivery.
Reduction and immobilization can restore alignment, allow soft tissue to rest, reduce hemorrhage, and improve pain control. Specific indications are covered in the “Deep Dive” section.
Many upper extremity MSK injuries can be managed on an outpatient basis after initial treatment in the ED for both surgical and non-operative treatment cases.
Because operative indications can vary widely for many upper extremity MSK injuries, timely orthopedic follow-up allows for a smooth transition from the ED to definitive treatment.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: A 21-y-old male rugby player presents after an on-field fall. He presents with a gross deformity of the right forearm and an associated 4-cm laceration along the ulnar border.
History
Determine and document the mechanism of injury (crush, blunt, sharp, etc.). The mechanism may guide management.
Inquire about wound exposure to soil, mulch, food processing materials, etc.
Determine and document ischemia time in the case of traumatic amputation or dysvascular extremity.
Monitor pain medication use; increasing requirements, especially after immobilization, should raise concern for ACS.
Physical
Inspect for signs of injury, including deformity, swelling, ecchymosis, and wounds.
A detailed neurovascular examination includes an assessment of distal pulses and the motor and sensory function of the axillary, radial, median, and ulnar nerves. Photo
Motor
Deltoid: Axillary nerve
Large shoulder movements not required and may be painful.
Palpate deltoid muscle to assess whether it is firing.
“Thumbs up” and wrist extension: Posterior interosseous nerve (branch of the radial nerve).
Positive if the patient is unable to terminally extend the thumb or extend the wrist.
“OK” sign: Anterior interosseous nerve (branch of the median nerve)
Positive if the patient is unable to make a circular “OK” sign with the thumb and index finger. Examiner will note an irregular shape caused by the inability to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb and the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger.
“2-3 cross”: Ulnar nerve
Positive if the patient is unable to cross the index and middle fingers.
Pearl: Must test with the wrist in neutral extension to isolate the function of the interosseous muscles. A false negative can occur if the exam is performed in wrist flexion due to action of the lumbrical muscles.
Sensory (moving light touch); compare to uninjured side.
Anterolateral shoulder: Axillary nerve
First dorsal webspace: Superficial radial nerve, between the thumb and index finger.
Volar index finger: Median nerve
Volar small finger: Ulnar nerve
Obtain plain films of the injured joint or extremity.
For fractures, order orthogonal X-rays of the fractured bone and the joints above and below the fractured bone.
For dislocations, order complete X-rays of the dislocated joint.
Post-reduction films are necessary to confirm acceptable alignment.

Simple dislocations of the shoulder or elbow require reduction and immobilization.
Anesthesia: Most dislocations can be closed reduced under local anesthesia (articular block), reserving procedural sedation for failed reductions.
Prior to administering anesthetics or performing closed reduction:
Must have complete X-rays to determine the direction of the dislocation.
Document detailed neurovascular examination findings.
Fracture-dislocations: Consult orthopedic surgery prior to attempting reduction.
Immobilization and bandages should be well-padded and non-circumferential.

Background
Epidemiology
Patients with upper extremity injuries comprise approximately 10% of all traumas presenting to the ED. The most common injury types are fracture, contusion/strain/sprain, laceration, and dislocation. 
Pathophysiology
ACS
Definition: A condition marked by an increase in hydrostatic pressure in a closed osteofascial space, resulting in decreased perfusion of the muscle and nerves within the compartment.
The upper arm has two compartments: anterior and posterior. The forearm has three compartments: volar, dorsal, and the “mobile wad.”
Reversible changes occur up to 4 h after injury; irreversible changes occur after 8 h.  Delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to sensory deficits, paralysis, infection, and Volkmann contracture, possibly requiring amputation. 
Causes include fracture, bleeding disorders, constrictive dressings or casts, arterial injury, extravasation of IV or IO infusion, and regional anesthesia. Of these, the most common cause is fracture. 
Open fracture does not preclude the development of ACS.
Open Fractures
Open fractures are complex injuries, characterized by variable degrees of soft tissue and skeletal injury, and are susceptible to infection and wound-healing complications. 
The Gustilo-Anderson classification of open fractures is commonly used to describe open fractures and facilitate communication among providers. This classification considers wound size, amount of periosteal stripping, and soft tissue damage. 
It is generally accepted that the infection risk increases with increasing Gustilo-Anderson type.
The time from injury to antibiotic delivery is the most important factor in preventing infection.
Open fractures of the upper extremity long bones generally require surgery for debridement and fracture stabilization.
With the exception of a vascular injury requiring repair or other extenuating circumstances, most open fractures do not require emergency surgery, but should nonetheless be treated expediently.  There is no “6-h” rule.
Dislocations
Dislocation is caused by disruption of the osseous, ligamentous, or dynamic stabilizers of the joint.
By convention, the direction of dislocation is described by the position of the distal bone relative to the proximal bone. For example, in a posterior elbow dislocation, the ulna translates posterior to the distal humerus.
Posterior SC dislocation: Although rare, posterior SC dislocation is associated with several life-threatening complications due to compression of the hilar structures. Patients with posterior SC dislocation may present with dyspnea, dysphagia, venous congestion, or dysesthesias, or they may develop such symptoms. 
Shoulder dislocation: The shoulder is the most commonly dislocated joint due to its relative lack of articular congruity and its reliance on soft tissue structures for stability. 
The vast majority of dislocations are anterior (97%), with the humeral head anterior to the glenoid.
Posterior dislocations (2-3%) are usually caused by trauma, but there is a well-known association with seizures and electrocution. Posterior dislocations can be missed or misdiagnosed as anterior dislocations, which can result in complications if an improper reduction maneuver is attempted. 
Inferior dislocations (<1%) are also known as luxatio erecta humeri and are associated with neurovascular complications.
Associated injuries include anteroinferior labral tear in young patients and rotator cuff tears and axillary nerve palsy in patients above 40 y. Impaction injuries to the postero-superior humeral head, the “Hill-Sachs lesion,” are common.
Ask the patient about the frequency of dislocation events. Exercise caution with frequent or volitional dislocators.
Elbow dislocation: The elbow joint is comprised of the ulnohumeral, radiocapitellar, and proximal radioulnar articulations. Stability is conferred by the osseous congruency of the ulnohumeral articulation, the medial and lateral collateral ligament complexes, and the dynamic action of the muscles crossing the elbow joint. Dislocation is usually posterior (90%), and there is a 10-15% rate of concomitant ipsilateral upper extremity injury with elbow dislocations. 
Fractures
Fractures are the most common category (27%) of upper extremity trauma presenting to the ED. 
Fractures can be associated with vascular or neurologic injury.
In general, although many adult upper extremity fractures are unstable and will be indicated for surgery, few benefit from manipulative closed reduction in the ED. Some notable exceptions to this include displaced distal radius fractures and Monteggia fracture-dislocation (proximal ulna fracture with associated radial head dislocation).
Combined fracture-dislocations of the elbow and forearm should not be overlooked. The following cases do require closed reduction in the ED:
The Monteggia fracture-dislocation is a fracture of the proximal ulna with associated radial head dislocation.
The Galeazzi fracture-dislocation is a fracture of the radius with a dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint.
There are few absolute indications for surgical treatment of upper extremity fractures. Instead, orthopedic surgeons consider many factors related to the injury and the patient when making treatment decisions.
Diagnostic Considerations
Imaging
Plain radiographs are generally sufficient for the evaluation of upper extremity MSK trauma.
Fractures:
Orthogonal views of the fractured bone and the joints above and below the fractured bone are recommended to completely evaluate the injury. Failure to recognize a fracture on imaging is the most common diagnostic error, but failure to obtain the views necessary to properly evaluate an injury also frequently occurs.
Manual traction radiographs can be useful in the evaluation of intra-articular fractures about the elbow (distal humerus, proximal ulna), but these should be ordered at the discretion of the orthopedic surgeon. Image
CT can be useful for pre-operative planning, particularly in the case of complex periarticular fractures.
Dislocations:
Sternoclavicular:
A “serendipity” view can be used to evaluate SC joint injuries. However, CT is the imaging modality of choice for SC injuries. 
CT is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating SC dislocations, as routine radiographic studies can be difficult to interpret. 
Shoulder:
Anteroposterior, scapular-Y, and axillary views. The axillary view is crucial to differentiate anterior from posterior dislocations but is frequently omitted even when explicitly ordered, due to patient discomfort. 
A “Velpeau” view, which does not require painful shoulder abduction, can be substituted.  The humeral head should be concentrically located on the glenoid in the axillary or Velpeau view.
Elbow:
When evaluating elbow series, the ulnohumeral, radiocapitellar, and proximal radioulnar joints should be inspected for congruency. The radial head should point to the capitellum in all views. Image
ACS
A high index of suspicion should always be maintained in the setting of fractures or dislocations. This is particularly true in the forearm where the soft tissue envelope is unforgiving.
Elbow trauma in particular may threaten the brachial artery which can be easily injured due to its proximity to the joint capsule.
Diagnosis is primarily clinical. ACS is characterized by a non-proportional, unrelenting, progressive pain that is not relieved by immobilization. 
Most of the traditional 6 P’s of ACS (pain, pallor, pressure, paresthesias, paralysis, and pulselessness) are unreliable, late findings of an established compartment syndrome.
Pain out of proportion to injury and pain with passive stretching of muscles in the involved compartment are the earliest indicators of compartment syndrome. 
In a survey study of Orthopaedic Trauma Association members, 93% of respondents reported that diagnosis of ACS was best achieved with a physical exam in awake patients, and 85% reported that direct pressure monitoring was the best approach for obtunded patients. 
If direct compartment pressure measurements are performed, measurements should be acquired close to the zone of injury or within 5 cm of the fracture.  One criterion suggests a diagnosis of compartment syndrome when the intra-compartmental pressure is within 30 mm Hg of diastolic blood pressure. 
Therapeutic Considerations
ACS
The treatment of ACS is emergency fasciotomy.
The optimal time from diagnosis to fasciotomy is less than 2 h. 
Fractures
Open fractures, fractures with compartment syndrome, and fractures with associated vascular injury require surgery. See the “Rapid Access” section for detailed initial management of open fractures. Fracture-dislocations require either reduction and immobilization or urgent surgery; Orthopedic Surgery should be consulted prior to attempts to reduce a fracture-dislocation.
Most fractures not meeting these criteria can be managed in the ED, and such patients can be discharged with close follow-up at an orthopedic surgery clinic. Indications for obtaining an orthopedic surgery consultation for such fractures will vary depending on the institutional protocol or practice setting.
Fracture patients who will be discharged after initial management should be advised to obtain their records and imaging and follow up promptly with an orthopedic surgeon in order to avoid treatment delays.
Dislocations
Sternoclavicular
Posterior SC dislocations require orthopedic consultation for closed reduction; it is commonly recommended that a thoracic surgeon be available in the event of a complication. 
Shoulder
Prior to any reduction attempts, confirm the direction of dislocation with orthogonal imaging and perform a thorough neurovascular exam. Pay particular attention to the axillary nerve.
Successful reduction is dependent upon adequate anesthesia. This may include a combination of pain medication, intraarticular anesthetic injection, peripheral nerve block, or conscious sedation.
Anterior dislocation
Multiple techniques exist but no technique has been proven to be superior. The practitioner should select the technique with which they feel most comfortable, and multiple techniques may be attempted for dislocations that are difficult to reduce.
It is critical to refrain from applying excessive force during any reduction maneuver as this exposes the patient to iatrogenic fracture and articular damage.
Caution should be exercised with chronic dislocations, particularly “locked” posterior dislocations in which a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion is engaged with the glenoid rim. Image
Common techniques:
Traction-countertraction
The patient is placed supine. Countertraction is provided with a sheet wrapped around the torso so the ends are free on the contralateral side. Longitudinal traction is initiated to clear the humeral head over the anterior edge of the glenoid.
Milch
This technique may be performed in either a seated or supine position. The humeral head is stabilized while the arm is fully abducted and the humeral head is gently slid over the anterior edge of the glenoid.
Stimson
This technique is performed with the patient in a prone position, therefore requiring a patient that can tolerate this position. The affected arm is left hanging over the edge of the bed or gurney, making sure there is adequate clearance between the arm and the floor. Gentle longitudinal traction is achieved by the application of a moderately-weighted item (ex. 1L saline bag) to the wrist. This position can be maintained for an extended time (5-30 mins) as tolerated by the patient. This traction fatigues the powerful deltoid muscle, distracts the humeral head from the glenoid, and may allow spontaneous reduction of the humeral head.
Posterior dislocation
Difficult to diagnose, particularly when only an AP shoulder XR is reviewed. The humeral head dislocates directly posteriorly and can appear to be congruent with the glenoid from this view. However, with further scrutiny, the “light bulb sign” can be detected. The humerus is internally rotated and the normal profile of the greater and lesser tuberosities is different than normal. Image
The most common reduction technique is similar to the traction-countertraction technique described above for anterior shoulder dislocation. The patient is placed supine. One assistant is required to hold countertraction on the torso and scapula while the practitioner flexes the shoulder to 90deg, adducts, and internally rotates. These motions lever the humeral head up and over to clear the posterior rim of the glenoid.
Following successful reduction: repeat neurovascular examination, obtain radiographs to confirm joint congruency, assess joint stability and immobilize shoulder.
Immobilization should consist of a shoulder immobilizer.
Early follow up with an orthopedic surgeon should be provided.
Elbow
Detailed neurovascular and ipsilateral extremity examination should be documented in suspected elbow dislocations prior to any reduction attempts.
Posterior dislocation
Common techniques:
Traction-countertraction
With the patient positioned sitting or supine and the elbow in slight flexion, slow steady longitudinal traction is provided on the wrist with countertraction provided on the middle/distal humerus.
Parvin’s
Similar to the Stimson method in shoulder reduction. Patient placed in prone position with affected extremity hanging over the edge of the bed. Technique involves application of gentle longitudinal traction to the wrist as described above followed by elevation of the humerus to reduce the elbow.
Meyn & Quigley method
Modification of Parvin’s method with the patient in prone and application of gentle longitudinal traction at the wrist. With the forearm hanging off the bed and traction applied, the provides opposite hand is used to guide the olecranon into position.
Following successful reduction: repeat neurovascular examination, obtain radiographs to confirm joint congruency, assess joint stability and immobilize elbow.
Immobilization should consist of long arm plaster splint at 90° with the forearm in a neutral position.
Early follow up with an orthopedic surgeon should be provided.
Immobilization
Immobilization is indicated in the ED management of upper extremity fractures and dislocations.
Splints should be sufficiently long and well-padded. Splint material should be non-circumferential in order to allow for swelling.
Clavicle fractures: Compared to the figure-of-eight bandage, sling immobilization is easier to apply and better tolerated by patients. 
Proximal humerus fractures: A sling or shoulder immobilizer should be applied.
Humerus shaft fractures: A coaptation splint should be applied. To apply a coaptation splint, the elbow of the injured arm is flexed 90° and a splint is applied from the axilla, along the medial surface of the upper arm, around the elbow, and up the lateral surface of the upper arm to reach the base of the neck. A gentle, medially directed mold at the level of the fracture is helpful for controlling varus deformity of the humerus. 
Fractures about the elbow and elbow dislocations: A posterior long arm splint with the elbow at approximately 90° should be applied. For complex, unstable injuries about the elbow, it is sometimes useful to combine a posterior long arm splint with a sugar tong splint.
Fractures of the forearm and distal radius: A sugar tong splint can be molded to maintain fracture reduction. To apply a sugar-tong splint, the elbow of the injured arm is flexed to 90°, with the forearm in neutral rotation. The splint is applied from the distal palmar crease, along the volar surface of the forearm, and around the elbow and dorsal surface to just proximal to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the hand. The thumb and the MCP joints should have free range of motion.",Upper Extremity Musculoskeletal Trauma
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Place on monitor and supplemental oxygen and obtain vascular access.
Obtain point-of-care glucose, electrolytes, hemoglobin, and venous blood gas and correct any significant abnormalities.
Give 10-20 mL/kg rapid 0.9% sodium chloride bolus IV or IO for shock and reassess.
Consider the differential diagnosis using THE MISFITS mnemonic. Table
Obtain urine and blood cultures and empirically treat for sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Initiate additional work-up and therapy according to the suspected etiology.
Empiric therapy for sepsis:
Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV (or 100 mg/kg meningitic dose) q6h, plus
Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV (or 100 mg/kg meningitic dose) IV q8h, or
Gentamicin 4 mg/kg IV q24h
In the United States cefotaxime is no longer being manufactured although one Canadian manufacturer is currently being allowed to import cefotaxime into the United States.
Other alternatives for cefotaxime if not available in the neonatal period include:
Cefipime 50 mg/kg IV/IM q12h (PNA 0-14 d) and 50 mg/kg q8h IV/IM (PNA ≥ 15d) or
Ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV/IM q12h (PNA 0-7 d) and q8-12h IV/IM (PNA ≥ 7 d)
These two agents also cover Pseudomonas if clinical concern.
Consider adding vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q12h. Dosage adjustments are needed in cases of renal insufficiency.
Some use vancomycin for all cases of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
Administer acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h for suspected neonatal herpes.
Note: Anything given IV can also be given IO or via umbilical vein catheter.
Note: The manufacture of cefotaxime is being discontinued. If cefotaxime is not available, providers may need to use ceftriaxone in patients without contraindications and gentamicin in patients with contraindications (eg, hyperbilirubinemia, use of calcium-containing solutions within 48 h).
Audio review neonatal metabolic emergencies 2019 EM:RAP Audio, Approach to the critical neonate Algorithm
Key Concepts
Neonatal emergencies encompass a broad array of conditions presenting in infants during the first month of life.
Symptoms and signs are often non-specific and subtle; emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion.
THE MISFITS is a mnemonic to recall some of the most common diagnoses. Table
Rapidly evaluate the neonate’s appearance, work of breathing, and circulation using the Pediatric Assessment TriangleTriangle and check for abnormal vital signs. 
In the critically ill neonate, empiric management must be initiated without knowing the underlying diagnosis.
The most common neonatal emergency is sepsis, and all critically ill neonates should be worked up for sepsis and treated with empiric antibiotics.
Hypoglycemia (primary or more often secondary) is also common; glucose should always be checked at the bedside and treated if low.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: Neonate in the first month of life with non-specific symptoms such as poor feeding, irritability, lethargy, vomiting; found on the physical exam to have poor perfusion, respiratory distress or failure, and/or altered mental status.
Important historical elements include feeding (amount, frequency, how the formula is mixed), fever, vomiting (bilious), urine and stool output, increased rate and work of breathing, irritability, seizure activity, trauma, birth history, and family history.
Bilious vomiting raises concern for midgut volvulus, which is a surgical emergency.
Improper feeding practices may give clues to hypo- or hypernatremia.
Carefully check vital signs for abnormalities; children who are hypotensive are late in the course of their disease process and may imminently arrest.
Examine for signs of respiratory distress: Look under clothing to appreciate (tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, cyanosis) and listen to lung sounds.
Examine for signs of poor perfusion (tachycardia, thready pulses, mottled skin, gray color), and listen for cardiac murmur, gallop rhythm.
Examine for abdominal distension, tenderness, or abdominal wall discoloration (these are seen in intestinal catastrophes) or hepatomegaly ≥3 cm below the right subcostal margin (seen in congestive heart failure).
Examine genitalia for ambiguity, hyperpigmentation, or other signs of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
Check for abnormal skin findings, particularly bruising in non-accidental trauma, petechiae in sepsis, vesicles in neonatal herpes, and hyperpigmentation in CAH.
Test point-of-care glucose, hemoglobin, and electrolytes and correct any abnormalities.
Test venous blood gas for acidosis, point-of-care or lab lactate, and ammonia to check for inborn errors of metabolism.
Perform a “rule-out sepsis” work-up, including CBC and blood cultures.
Lumbar puncture should be deferred in the unstable patient.
Hyperoxia test: If application of 100% O2 does not raise the patient’s O2 saturation by 10%, particularly if the patient is in the first 2 wk of life, this is indicative of a cyanotic ductal-dependent heart lesion.
Pulse, systolic blood pressure, or O2 saturation differential between pre-ductal (right upper extremity) and post-ductal (either lower extremity) is indicative of a ductal-dependent heart lesion obstructing systemic flow.
Imaging considerations: Chest X-ray for cardiomegaly and pneumonia; abdominal radiograph for signs of intestinal catastrophe; focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) if there is suspected trauma; CT and other studies as indicated by the history and physical exam.
ECG may be helpful but it is not needed immediately, unless there is suspicion of dysrhythmia based on cardiopulmonary monitor findings or suspected congenital heart disease.
Treatment
If there is respiratory failure or shock, resuscitate appropriately.
For shock, administer 0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 10-20 mL/kg; reassess and repeat as indicated.
For hypoglycemia with blood glucose <60 mg/dL, give D10W 2-3 mL/kg IV or IO.
Empiric therapy for sepsis:
Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV (or 100 mg/kg meningitic dose) q6h, plus
Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV (or 100 mg/kg meningitic dose) IV q8h, or
Gentamicin 4 mg/kg IV q24h
In the United States cefotaxime is no longer being manufactured although one Canadian manufacturer is currently being allowed to import cefotaxime into the United States.
Other alternatives for cefotaxime if not available in the neonatal period include:
Cefipime 50 mg/kg IV/IM q12h (PNA 0-14 d) and 50 mg/kg q8h IV/IM (PNA ≥ 15d) or
Ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV/IM q12h (PNA 0-7 d) and q8-12h IV/IM (PNA ≥ 7 d)
These two agents also cover Pseudomonas if clinical concern.
Consider adding vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q12h. Dosage adjustments are needed in cases of renal insufficiency.
Some use vancomycin for all cases of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
If omphalitis is present or if there is another reason for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage, give vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q12h. Dosage adjustments are needed in cases of renal insufficiency.
If there are skin or mucous membrane vesicles, conjunctivitis concerning for herpes, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid, elevated LFTs, maternal history of herpes, or seizures, give acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h.
For symptomatic hyponatremia or serum sodium <125 mEq/dL, give 3% sodium chloride 5 mL/kg IV.
For symptomatic hypocalcemia or serum calcium <7 mg/dL, give calcium gluconate 100 mg/kg IV.
Anemia: For hemoglobin <7 g/dL, give packed red blood cells (PRBCs) 10 mL/kg.
For fluid-refractory shock, the vasopressor of choice in pediatrics is epinephrine infusion 0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min, titrated to response.
For suspected ductal-dependent cardiac lesions, give prostaglandin E1 infusion 0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min.
Start before confirmatory tests, such as ECG.
Strict monitoring for medication-induced hypotension or apnea.
Disposition
Admission
Neonates with suspected emergency conditions (even if not confirmed or if stabilized in the ED) should not be discharged.
Admit the patient to the pediatric ICU (or the neonatal ICU, per local policy).

Obtain early Pediatric Surgery consultation if midgut volvulus, necrotizing enterocolitis, omphalitis, or trauma is suspected.",Neonatal Emergencies
"Deep Dive - Trauma
Background
Epidemiology
The most common mechanisms of injury for accidental trauma are falls from furniture and parent’s arms. 
Injury severity scores are higher in infants <1 y old as compared with older children.
If no history of trauma is given, non-accidental trauma should still be considered. 
Mortality in non-accidental trauma is 6× higher than in accidental trauma.
Non-accidental trauma is more common in the first few years of life.
Pathophysiology
Head Injury
Infants have relatively larger heads and are more likely to land head-first after a fall (lawn dart effect).
Open fontanels provide a “release” for increased intracranial pressure such that symptoms may be a less reliable indicator of severe injury.
Incomplete ossification of the skull and overlap with birth-related cephalohematomas complicates physical exam and radiograph interpretation.
Unlike older patients, a young infant can lose enough blood from an intracranial hemorrhage to result in shock.
Abusive head trauma (previously known as shaken baby syndrome) is associated with subdural hemorrhage. 
Thoracic Injury
Due to their flexible, cartilaginous skeleton, significant internal thoracic trauma can occur without external signs or rib fractures.
Pulmonary contusions are more common than other chest injuries.
Abdominal Injury
The liver and spleen are located below the protective rib cage, and a lack of protective fat and musculature results in increased injury to these organs.
Skeletal Injury
Classic metaphyseal lesions, posterior rib fractures, multiple unexplained fractures, and any unexplained fracture in a non-ambulatory infant are concerning for non-accidental trauma.
Diagnostic Considerations
Suspect non-accidental trauma if the history changes or is inconsistent with the injury observed or with the child’s developmental capabilities (eg, neonates cannot roll on their own) or if there is a delay in seeking care.
Physical exam: Suspect trauma if there is bruising, evidence of fracture (swelling, deformity), abdominal tenderness or distension, bulging fontanelle, intraoral injury (frenulum tears), or shock with low hemoglobin (internal bleeding).
Laboratory Evaluation
Serial hemoglobin, CBC, coagulation studies, and type and screen/crossmatch.
Blood chemistries, aspartate/alanine aminotransferase, and lipase/amylase to screen for abdominal trauma.
UA: Microscopic hematuria is a marker of intra-abdominal trauma.
Serum lactate to follow as a marker of injury severity and hypoperfusion.
Radiographic Evaluation
Perform FAST in critically ill neonates to rule-out free fluid, pneumothorax, or cardiac tamponade.
A skeletal survey should be performed in suspected non-accidental trauma.
20 image series; no babygrams.
Unexplained fractures, multiple fractures, fractures in various stages of healing, pathognomonic fractures such as posterior rib, and classic metaphyseal raise concern for non-accidental trauma.
Chest radiograph: Assess for rib and clavicle fractures, evidence of pulmonary contusion, and pneumothorax (mediastinal mobility in children results in a higher risk).
Most pediatric thoracic injuries can be identified by chest radiograph. 
Clavicle fractures may be new or birth-related.
Obtain a history regarding birth difficulties before revealing that there is a fracture.
CT scan of the head, the abdomen/pelvis, and less commonly the chest or neck, as clinically indicated.
Therapeutic Considerations
Activate Trauma Team/Surgery consultation as soon as the etiologic mechanism of the trauma is suspected or recognized.
Obtain vascular access (IV; if not successful within 2 attempts/60 s, place IO line).
Give 20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid fluid if there is evidence of shock.
If patient is unresponsive to fluid or exhibits low or dropping hemoglobin, give 10 mL/kg PRBCs.
Although massive transfusion protocols have not been well studied in children, consider treating ongoing bleeding and hemorrhagic shock with 10-20 mL/kg 1:1:1 PRBCs, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. 
Intubate and mechanically ventilate for Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8, inability to protect the airway, inadequate oxygenation or ventilation, or expected clinical course.
Institute neuroprotective measures for suspected or diagnosed traumatic brain injury: Elevate the head of the bed 30°; avoid hypoxia, hypovolemia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and hyperthermia. Consider anticonvulsant prophylaxis.
If there is evidence of elevated intracranial pressure/impending herniation, mild hyperventilation to pCO2 35mmHg, mannitol 0.25-1 g/kg IV/IO. 
3% sodium chloride 3-6 mL/kg IV/IO may be used instead of mannitol, although the most recent severe traumatic brain injury guidelines recommend mannitol in normotensive patients. 
Keep the child, room, IV fluids, blood products, and inhaled gases warm to avoid cold stress-induced acidosis and coagulopathy. 
Assess for specific traumatic injuries (eg, tamponade, pneumothorax) and provide the appropriate treatment.",Neonatal Emergencies
"Deep Dive - Heart Disease
Background
Epidemiology
Critical congenital heart disease incidence is ~1.7/1,000 live births. 
Ductal-dependent circulation incidence is ~1/1,000 live births. 
Discharge from the nursery without recognition of ductal-dependent critical cardiac lesion incidence is 7-9/100,000 live births. 
Among infants with ductal-dependent circulation, 28% are discharged without nursery pulse oximetry screening vs. 5% with screening. 
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common pediatric dysrhythmia. 
The overall incidence of pediatric SVT is 1:250 to 1:1000 patients; SVT is even more common in patients with congenital heart defects.
The incidence of presentation in the first month of life is 0.06/1,000 patients per year. 
Pathophysiology
Ductal-dependent circulation is the most common presentation of critical congenital heart disease during the neonatal period. 
Normal ductus arteriosus closure occurs in the first few days of life, but closure is often prolonged in infants with congenital heart lesions. 
Infants typically present in the first 1-2 wk of life.
Infants with left-sided obstructive lesions (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, aortic coarctation, critical aortic valve stenosis) depend on a patent ductus arteriosus for systemic flow.
As the ductus closes, these patients present with shock and cyanosis (gray baby).
Infants with right-sided obstructive lesions (critical pulmonary valve stenosis, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum) depend on a patent ductus arteriosus for pulmonary flow.
As the ductus closes, these patients present with worsening cyanosis (blue baby).
Since cyanosis is not appreciable until 5 g/dL hemoglobin is deoxygenated, it may be less recognizable but more impactful in relatively anemic infants.
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) is an uncommon congenital heart defect that may present after nursery discharge in rare cases. 
Oxygenated pulmonary venous blood returns to the right atrium rather than the left atrium; a mixing lesion, such as an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, is needed for survival.
A small subset of TAPVR may result in pulmonary venous obstruction, leading to pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, and hypoxia.
Unrecognized prolonged SVT may result in cardiomyopathy and heart failure.
Diagnostic Considerations
History clues include poor weight gain, poor feeding (sweating with feeding), increased work of breathing, irritability, or lethargy.
Physical exam clues include cyanosis, poor perfusion, respiratory distress, murmur (although often not present), hepatomegaly, and a pulse/blood pressure differential between the right upper extremity and the lower extremities.
Pulse oximetry screening: This is performed on the asymptomatic newborn while on room air prior to hospital discharge to identify cardiac conditions before symptom onset.  Results are not specific to cardiac conditions but can serve as a harbinger of congenital cardiac pathology.
Place a pulse oximetry monitor in a pre-ductal position on the right upper extremity (RUE) and another in a post-ductal position on any lower extremity (LE).
Positive screen (concern for critical congenital heart disease)
Oxygen saturation <90% in any location (RUE or LE)
Oxygen saturation ≤94% in RUE and LE
Oxygen saturation difference >3% between RUE and LE
Hyperoxia test: This is performed on the symptomatic neonate presenting to care for signs and symptoms possibly indicative of a cyanotic congenital cardiac condition. 
Cyanosis due to a pulmonary cause is expected to improve with supplemental oxygen, whereas cyanosis due to ductal-dependent circulation (shunting) is not.
Symptoms may actually worsen as oxygen constricts the ductus arteriosus and, as a pulmonary vasodilator, may throw off the pulmonary to systemic flow balance. 
Classically, an arterial blood gas (ABG) is performed on room air and after the patient receives 100% oxygen for 10 min.
If PaO2 rises to ≥150 mm Hg, non-cardiac etiology is more likely.
If PaO2 remains <100 mm Hg, this is a “failed hyperoxia test” and is indicative of ductal-dependent cardiac disease.
In practice, obtaining two ABGs in a critically ill neonate is difficult; therefore, pulse oximetry can be used as a surrogate.
Although limitations exist, ductal-dependent circulation may be suspected if oxygen saturation does not rise by 10% or more as shown by pulse oximetry following 100% oxygen supplementation. 
Brain natriuretic peptide is less well-studied in children than in adults, but elevation may help to identify cardiac disease as the etiology over respiratory etiologies. 
From birth to 1 wk of life, a cut-off of <170 pg/mL is considered normal.
After 1 wk of life, the cut-off is <41 pg/mL.
ECG may provide diagnostic clues to cardiac disease, particularly the presence of ventricular hypertrophy.
Cardiac monitoring and ECG may reveal SVT or the delta wave of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in patients with prolonged dysrhythmia as the cause of symptoms.
Chest X-ray may show cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema (left-sided obstructive lesions, obstructed TAPVR), or decreased pulmonary flow (right-sided obstructive lesions).
Echocardiograpm provides definitive diagnosis of the cardiac lesion, but practitioners should not delay therapy, in particular prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), to obtain a confirmatory ECG.
Practitioners with training in limited bedside ECG may use U/S to assess cardiac contractility and screen for the absence of 4 chambers seen in hypoplastic left heart disease and other complex lesions.
Patients with obstructed TAPVR will also present with respiratory distress, cyanosis, and hypoxia, as well as congestive (right heart) failure. 
Hypoxia will not respond to supplemental oxygen.
Because this is not a ductal-dependent lesion, differences in pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturation are not expected.
Therapeutic Considerations
After standard resuscitation, if a ductal-dependent cardiac lesion is suspected, initiate PGE1 IV infusion at 0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min. 
Early PGE1 therapy can be life-saving and should be initiated as soon as ductal-dependent circulation is suspected, eg, by patient presentation, pulse oximetry screening, and hyperoxia testing.
Common adverse effects of PGE1 are apnea and hypotension.
Be prepared to provide appropriate support.
Improved ductal patency and clinical improvement usually occur within 30 min to 2 h. 
Once the patient is stabilized and improving, wean down the infusion rate by increments of 0.01 μg/kg/min to the lowest needed dose to maintain patency.
The rare patient with obstructed TAPVR may worsen on PGE1, since PGE1 dilates the pulmonary vasculature and worsens the left to right shunt through the ductus.
Do not, however, withhold PGE1 initially, since obstructed TAPVR is much more rare than ductal-dependent lesions.
Fluid bolus is initially indicated for infants in shock.
If cardiac disease is suspected, a smaller bolus of 10 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid is often used, with reassessment afterwards.
If the patient worsens following fluid administration, cardiac disease is more likely.
Patients often require intubation and mechanical ventilation, either due to respiratory distress or apnea resulting from PGE1 therapy or as a precaution prior to transport to a tertiary care center.
Use hemodynamically neutral induction agents such as etomidate or fentanyl.
Use rocuronium rather than succinylcholine, since conditions causing hyperkalemia are part of the differential diagnosis of the critically ill neonate.
Positive-pressure ventilation reduces preload and systemic vascular resistance and increases pulmonary vascular resistance, which may improve or worsen the balance of pulmonary to systemic flow, depending on the specific patient’s underlying pathophysiology. 
Patients may require additional inotropic support with epinephrine or dopamine and/or afterload reduction with milrinone.
SVT in hemodynamically unstable patients is treated with synchronized cardioversion 0.5-1 J/kg.
Stable patients may be treated with adenosine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV, and unstable patients may be given a dose while preparing for cardioversion.
Verapamil should not be used in neonates, since it is associated with ventricular dysrhythmias and sudden death. 
Consult with a pediatric cardiologist as soon as possible, but do not delay resuscitation and stabilization of the patient.",Neonatal Emergencies
"Deep Dive - Endocrine Causes
Background - Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
Epidemiology
Incidence of the classic form of CAH ranges from 1:5000 to 1:15,000 live births, depending on ethnicity. 
Neonatal screening for CAH is performed in 40 countries, including all 50 states in the U.S.
False-positive screens are very common.
False-negative rates as high as 22.4% have been reported. 
Some states perform a second screen at 8-14 d old, reducing the false-negative rate.
Pathophysiology
CAH is an autosomal recessive genetic disease involving a mutation in genes encoding enzymes involved in steroidogenesis. 
The most common (>95%) enzyme affected is 21-hydroxylase.
Decreased enzymatic activity results in cortisol deficiency, aldosterone deficiency, and accumulation of intermediates with androgenic activity.
Diagnostic Considerations - Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
The classic salt-wasting form of CAH is the form that presents as a critically ill neonate, typically in the first 10-14 d of life. 
The median date of diagnosis of classic salt-wasting CAH is 26 d for males and 13 d for females. 
Girls are recognized earlier due to the presence of ambiguous genitalia.
Historical clues include poor feeding, poor weight gain, vomiting, and lethargy, which are non-specific.
Physical exam findings include signs of dehydration, poor perfusion, and evidence of androgenization/virilization. 
Girls may have ambiguous genitalia, clitoromegaly, and fused labia majora with rugae (scrotal appearance) and may have even been assigned male gender at birth.
Boys do not have ambiguous genitalia but may have an enlarged penis and testes and hyperpigmented skin.
Cortisol deficiency results in fluid and vasopressor refractory shock and may result in hypoglycemia.
Mineralocorticoid deficiency results in hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.
Levels of the intermediate metabolite 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) are elevated in 21-hydroxylase deficiency, although empiric treatment should be started prior to confirmation, since results will not be available during the ED visit.
False negatives (normal 17-OHP) occur in approximately 10%. 
Background -Thyrotoxicosis
Epidemiology
Neonatal Graves disease occurs in 1:25,000 to 1:50,000 newborns  and may present as thyrotoxicosis.
Pathophysiology
Mothers with Graves disease may have thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies that have crossed the placenta. 
Neonates of these mothers may be hyperthyroid, euthyroid, or hypothyroid.
If the mother was taking antithyroid drugs during pregnancy, neonates may not present until they have metabolized these drugs post-birth, at 10-20 d of life.
Other pathogenetic mechanisms include de novo mutations in genes coding for TSH receptor antibodies and as a complication of McCune-Albright syndrome.
Diagnostic Considerations - Thyrotoxicosis
Historical clues to neonatal hyperthyroidism include maternal Graves disease, intrauterine growth retardation, poly- or oligohydramnios, premature birth, irritability, poor sleep, hyperexcitability, poor feeding, increased appetite, poor weight gain, diarrhea, flushing, or sweating.
Physical exam findings include tachycardia (>160 bpm), hypertension, tachypnea and/or respiratory distress, fever, tremors, proptosis/staring facies, goiter, small fontanelle, craniosynostosis, and microcephaly.
Complications such as hepatosplenomegaly and congestive heart failure may occur.
Lab tests should include TSH, free T4, and TSH receptor antibody levels, but the results may not be available during the ED visit.
Therapeutic Considerations
Initiate standard resuscitation measures including normal saline fluid boluses and vasopressors for fluid-refractory shock.
Consult with a pediatric endocrinologist as soon as possible after resuscitation and stabilization of the patient.
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
Check bedside glucose and treat any hypoglycemia with 2-3 mL/kg 10% dextrose in water.
CAH should be suspected and treated in infants with consistent physical signs, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, and fluid and vasopressor refractory shock.
After drawing blood samples for steroid hormones and metabolites, give hydrocortisone 25 mg IV empirically.
Fludrocortisone 0.05-0.2 mg PO q24h can be started once the diagnosis is confirmed.
Treat hyperkalemia using standard therapies.
Thyrotoxicosis
Treat suspected thyrotoxicosis with anti-thyroid drugs. 
Methimazole 0.25 mg/kg PO q12h
Lugol solution or potassium iodide 1 drop (0.05 mL) q8h, given at least 1 h after the first dose of methimazole
Propylthiouracil is not recommended in neonates due to hepatotoxicity
Treat symptomatic thyrotoxicosis with beta blockers.
Propranolol 0.5-1 mg/kg PO q12h
Glucocorticoids may benefit critically ill infants by decreasing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.
Hydrocortisone 2.5 mg/kg or prednisone 1 mg/kg",Neonatal Emergencies
"Deep Dive - Metabolic Causes
Background
Epidemiology
Hypoglycemia occurs in 1:1,400 (0.07%) children presenting to the ED. 
Late-onset (>4 d old) neonatal hypocalcemia occurred in 0.02% of neonates presenting to a large tertiary children’s hospital. 
Early-onset neonatal hypocalcemia is typically due to a normal decline in serum calcium levels.
The median age at presentation of late neonatal hypocalcemia is 8 d old.
Significant hypercalcemia was found in 1:500 children <17 y old with a calcium level ordered, and neonates accounted for 41% of these patients. 
Pathophysiology
Hypoglycemia
Multiple congenital or acquired conditions can lead to hypoglycemia.
Neonatal hypoglycemia in the first 48 h of life may be due to transitional neonatal glucose regulation. 
Lower glucose levels are tolerated if the patient is asymptomatic, and a thorough work-up is not needed.
Young children are more susceptible to the negative effects of hypoglycemia, since they have higher glucose utilization rates and lower glycogen stores and the developing brain is more susceptible to injury. 
Hypocalcemia
Hypocalcemia may result from late maturation of the parathyroid hormone axis, syndromes associated with parathyroid gland abnormality (eg, DiGeorge syndrome), vitamin D deficiency, phosphorus-rich milk intake, or hypomagnesemia (required for parathyroid hormone secretion and function), among other causes. 
Hypercalcemia
Hypercalcemia may result from many etiologies, including parathyroid-related causes, mutation in a calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR), SC fat necrosis, hypophosphatemia and hypophosphatasia, William syndrome, sepsis, vitamin D and vitamin A intoxication, renal insufficiency, blue diaper syndrome (congenital defect in tryptophan absorption), and idiopathic causes. 
Hyponatremia and Hypernatremia
See Formula Mishaps below.
Respiratory syncytial viral bronchiolitis is also associated with hyponatremia, with one series finding 11% with serum sodium <130 mmol/L and 4% suffering hyponatremic seizures. 
Hypernatremia commonly results from gastrointestinal losses (diarrhea).
Diagnostic Considerations
Additional work-up to diagnose the underlying cause of the metabolic abnormality, often under the guidance of a pediatric endocrinologist, can be undertaken once the patient is stabilized.
Hypoglycemia
Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include lethargy, irritability, jitteriness, seizures, hypothermia, and apnea.
Point-of-care bedside glucose should be assessed early in the resuscitation process for all critically ill neonates.
After 48 h of age, a level <60 mg/dL is considered hypoglycemia. 
If there is time, it is helpful to draw a red top tube for insulin, cortisol, and growth hormone levels, which are best obtained during the hypoglycemic episode. 
Hypocalcemia
Symptoms of hypocalcemia include seizures, jitteriness, myoclonic jerks, tetany, apnea, cyanosis, and dysrhythmias. 
Point-of-care calcium measurement yields quick results.
Hypocalcemia is present when the total serum calcium is <8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L) or the ionized calcium level is <4.8 mg/dL (1.2 mmol/L).
ECG may show a prolonged QT interval.
Serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels should be measured.
Hypercalcemia
Symptoms of hypercalcemia include vomiting, poor feeding, irritability, polyuria, bradycardia, hypertension, lethargy, and hypotonia.
SC fat necrosis presents in the first few weeks of life as firm purple-red nodules on the face, trunk, buttocks, and extremities. 
Approximately one half of these patients have hypercalcemia.
Point-of-care calcium measurements yield quick results.
Hypercalcemia is present when the total serum calcium is >10.8 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) or the ionized calcium level is >5.4 mg/dL (1.35 mmol/L). 
ECG may show a shortened QT interval.
Serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels should be measured.
Hyponatremia and Hypernatremia
See Formula Mishaps below.
Therapeutic Considerations
Hypoglycemia
Treat symptomatic hypoglycemia with 2-3 mL/kg 10% dextrose in water IV, with a goal glucose level of 70 mg/dL. 
Continue to monitor bedside glucose to assess for improvement and to identify any recurrence of hypoglycemia.
Maintain a high degree of underlying sepsis in hypoglycemic neonates.
If dextrose infusion does not maintain adequate glucose levels or if hyperinsulinism is suspected, glucagon 0.5-1 mg (not weight-based) can be given IV, IM, or SC.
Hypocalcemia
Treat symptomatic hypocalcemia with calcium gluconate 100 mg/kg (1 mL/kg 10% calcium gluconate) IV over 5-10 min. 
Calcium chloride 20 mg/kg (0.2 mL/kg 10% calcium chloride) IV may be given instead, although this risks vein sclerosis at the infusion site.
Correct any associated hypomagnesemia.
Magnesium sulfate 25-50 mg/kg IV for a magnesium level <1.5 mg/dL.
Hypercalcemia
Administer 0.9% sodium chloride bolus IV 20 mL/kg followed by continued fluids at 1.5-2× maintenance to promote calcium excretion.
Furosemide 1 mg/kg IV also promotes calcium excretion.
For severely affected patients, calcitonin 4-8 international units/kg SC or IM acutely reduces serum calcium. 
Dialysis is reserved for very severe cases.
Bisphosphonates are added once the patient is stabilized, in consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist.

"Deep Dive - Inborn Errors of Metabolism
Background
Epidemiology
Each individual inborn error is rare, but together, the prevalence is 1/784-2,555 infants. 
Due to geographic variations in newborn screening, a lack of screening for all possible inborn errors, and false-negative screens, emergency providers may still be faced with the undiagnosed patient presenting with an inborn error of metabolism.
Pathophysiology
For each inborn error, a genetic mutation, commonly autosomal recessive, results in a lack of production of a protein, usually an enzyme.
Without this protein, the corresponding metabolic pathway does not progress normally, resulting in the accumulation of toxic intermediates/metabolites and/or energy molecule deficiencies.
Diagnostic Considerations
Symptoms are non-specific and may be mistaken for sepsis: Poor feeding, lethargy, irritability, vomiting, hyperpnea/tachypnea due to acidosis, and temperature instability.
Hypotonia, seizures, cardiac dysfunction, and shock can also occur.
Even if an inborn error of metabolism is highly suspected, all patients should undergo a sepsis work-up and empiric treatment for sepsis.
Sepsis is a common complication of inborn errors.
Family history findings of consanguinity in the parents or death in infancy or metabolic disorder in the siblings are important clues pointing toward inborn errors.
Physical exam clues include hepatomegaly in, for example, glycogen storage disorders, hypotonia, tachypnea, or hyperpnea.
Some inborn errors result in the accumulation of a metabolite that produces a characteristic odor (eg, sweaty socks).
Laboratory
Bedside glucose and point-of-care venous blood gas and lactate produce quick results that may point the practitioner toward the diagnosis.
Blood samples should be drawn prior to corrective therapy if possible (especially dextrose). 
Helpful initial tests include CMP with electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, LFTs, ammonia, lactate, and UA to check for ketonuria and reducing substances.
CBC and coagulation tests are also usually obtained, since they may be abnormal in some inborn errors and the initial differential includes sepsis.
Ammonia must be interpreted using age-appropriate cut-offs; suspect an inborn error when levels are >200 µmol/L. 
Extremely high ammonia levels >2,000 µmol/L are indicative of a urea cycle disorder and should be immediately treated.
An anion gap acidosis may be present due to elevated lactate or accumulation of organic acids.
If Na − Cl − HCO3 − lactate = 8-16 mEq/L, the anion gap acidosis can be attributed to lactate, and the defect is likely in carbohydrate or fat metabolism (eg, glycogen storage disorder, fatty acid oxidation disorder, or carnitine shuttle defect). 
If there is still a large anion gap after accounting for lactate, organic acidemia is the likely disorder.
Urea cycle disorders often produce a respiratory alkalosis due to accumulated ammonia stimulating the respiratory center. 
Urine tests
Hypoglycemia without ketonuria is highly suggestive of a fatty acid oxidation defect. 
Hypoglycemia with ketonuria occurs in disorders of carbohydrate metabolism or organic acidemias. Ketonuria from starvation alone is highly unlikely in neonates.
The presence of reducing substances in the urine may point toward galactosemia, fructosuria, or organic aciduria. 
Once inborn error of metabolism rises is highly suspected, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, and plasma free carnitine and acylcarnitines should be obtained.
Therapeutic Considerations
Empiric therapy for a suspected inborn error of metabolism can, and should, be instituted prior to confirmation of the specific defect or category of defect.
Contacting the state newborn screening program to determine any abnormal results may identify the defect at hand.
Consult with a pediatric metabolic specialist as soon as the patient is sufficiently resuscitated and stabilized.
Stop the defective catabolic processes, correct energy deficiencies, and provide dextrose as an energy source.
Make the patient nil per os, preventing potentially toxic substrates, such as proteins and fats found in breastmilk or formula, from being metabolized via the abnormal pathway.
Correct any hypoglycemia with 2-4 mL/kg 10% dextrose in water IV.
If an initial fluid bolus is indicated for poor perfusion, use D5W/0.9% sodium chloride instead of plain 0.9% sodium chloride.
Begin maintenance fluids using D10 with 0.45 NS at 1.5× maintenance.
The goal is to provide 8-12 mg/kg/min glucose. 
Some disorders require even higher dextrose concentrations, such as D15W.
To provide sufficient energy to reverse the catabolic state, insulin 0.05-0.1 units/kg/h may need to be started to avoid hyperglycemia.
The decision to correct acidosis must balance the risks of organ dysfunction and cardiovascular collapse due to severe acidosis from bicarbonate therapy. 
Consider sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV in profoundly acidotic patients with refractory shock.
For significantly elevated ammonia levels (usually a suspected urea cycle disorder), give sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate (Ammonul®) 250 mg/kg IV over 1-2 h to promote the excretion of ammonia.
If ammonia remains significantly elevated (>500 mmol/L), immediately begin the institution’s process to provide hemodialysis or initiate transfer, if necessary.
Carnitine is a key cofactor in many metabolic pathways and is particularly helpful in the treatment of fatty acid oxidation disorders and organic acidemias.
Risks are few; thus, empiric administration when the type of inborn error is still unknown is unlikely to be harmful.
Give L-carnitine 50 mg/kg IV as a bolus. 
Even if an inborn error of metabolism is highly suspected, all patients should undergo a sepsis work-up and empiric treatment for sepsis.
Sepsis is a common complication of inborn errors.",Neonatal Emergencies
"Deep Dive - Sepsis
Background
Epidemiology
Incidence is 1-4/1,000 live births, depending on the population. 
Intra-partum antibiotic prophylaxis in mothers with known group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection reduces the incidence of early GBS neonatal sepsis, but not late (≥7 d old.) 
Sepsis is by far the most common underlying etiology in the critically ill neonate.
Neonatal herpes is uncommon but devastating, affecting 10/100,000 live births. 
Pathophysiology
Early neonatal sepsis within the first few days of life results from exposure to organisms in the birth canal, particularly if chorioamnionitis was present. 
Common organisms are GBS and Escherichia coli.
Maternal GBS colonization, prematurity of the infant, and prolonged rupture of membranes are risk factors.
Late neonatal sepsis (≥7 days of life) occurs from contact with pathogens in an infant with an immature immune system and no protection by vaccinations.
Common organisms are GBS, Escherichia coli, other Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes.
Other less common organisms are Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Maternal GBS colonization and prematurity of the infant are risk factors.
Neonatal herpes is contracted through exposure to maternal herpes in the birth canal. 
Mothers are often asymptomatic at the time of delivery and are unaware that they have herpes.
Disseminated and skin-eye-mouth disease occurs in the first week of life, but herpes sepsis/meningitis typically occurs in the second-third weeks of life.
Diagnostic Considerations
History
Historical clues are typically non-specific and include poor feeding, irritability, lethargy, respiratory distress and/or grunting respirations, apnea, and lethargy. 
Birth history should address gestational age, birth route (vaginal vs. c-section), maternal infections including GBS and herpes, prolonged rupture of membranes, and complications at and after birth.
Physical Exam
Assess for fever or hypothermia (<36°C), skin mottling or rash, signs of poor perfusion (tachycardia, weak pulses, delayed capillary refill), poor tone, jaundice, increased work of breathing and/or grunting, or bulging fontanelle.
A thorough skin exam for vesicular lesions of neonatal herpes should be performed, although 17%-39% never have a rash. 
Suspect neonatal herpes in a patient presenting with seizures.
Laboratory Tests
Obtain cultures of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid if the patient is sufficiently stable.
CBC may show leukocytosis, left shift, and/or bandemia.
Acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin, may be elevated.
Serum lactate serves as a marker for severity of illness.
Point-of-care bedside glucose should be checked to identify concomitant hypoglycemia.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur, and a panel of tests to assess this should be sent.
Neonatal herpes may be suspected with elevated liver transaminases and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis.
Definitive diagnosis of neonatal herpes is via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification or viral culture of the herpes simplex virus, often in a cerebrospinal fluid or skin lesion sample.
Therapeutic Considerations
Start standard resuscitative measures, including airway management, fluid therapy, and inotropic support, as indicated.
Administer 0.9% sodium chloride at 20 mL/kg IV.
Epinephrine infusion at 0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min IV if shock persists despite fluids.
Identify and correct metabolic abnormalities.
Administer broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics within 1 h of arrival, if possible.
Empiric therapy for sepsis:
Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV (or 100 mg/kg meningitic dose) q6h, plus
Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV (or 100 mg/kg meningitic dose) IV q8h, or
Gentamicin 4 mg/kg IV q24h
In the United States cefotaxime is no longer being manufactured although one Canadian manufacturer is currently being allowed to import cefotaxime into the United States.
Other alternatives for cefotaxime if not available in the neonatal period include:
Cefipime 50 mg/kg IV/IM q12h (PNA 0-14 d) and 50 mg/kg q8h IV/IM (PNA ≥ 15d) or
Ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV/IM q12h (PNA 0-7 d) and q8-12h IV/IM (PNA ≥ 7 d)
These two agents also cover Pseudomonas if clinical concern.
Consider adding vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q12h. Dosage adjustments are needed in cases of renal insufficiency.
Some use vancomycin for all cases of late-onset neonatal sepsis.
Administer acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h for suspected neonatal herpes.
The manufacture of cefotaxime is being discontinued. If cefotaxime is not available, providers may need to use ceftriaxone in patients without contraindications and gentamicin in patients with contraindications (eg, hyperbilirubinemia, use of calcium-containing solutions within 48 h).",Neonatal Emergencies
"Deep Dive - Formula Mishaps
Background
Epidemiology
Hyponatremia has been reported as the cause of 70% of seizures in infants <6 mo old when no obvious alternative cause was known at the time of presentation (eg, no fever, trauma, or intracranial pathology). 
Hypernatremia is less common.
Pathophysiology
Administration of excess free water is a common cause of hyponatremia. 
Parents may over-dilute formula to save money.
The correct way to mix powdered formula is 2 ounces of water to 1 scoop of formula.
Parents may substitute formula feeds with other liquids such as teas, juices, or water to save money or due to cultural practices or misunderstanding (no free water should be administered prior to 3 mo old).
Parents may misunderstand and “treat” diarrhea with water or other hypotonic fluids in place of formula feeding.
Hypernatremia results from water loss or inadequate water intake: 
Gastrointestinal losses from diarrhea.
Mixing formula incorrectly such that it is over-concentrated.
Inadequate breastfeeding, either because the mother’s milk is inadequate or due to misunderstanding or neglect.
Early nursery discharge or inadequate nutritional education may contribute to misunderstandings regarding feeding and formula preparation.
Diagnostic Considerations
Hyponatremia due to dilution of formula or other water intoxication presents with seizures that are often resistant to standard therapy, hypothermia, and respiratory insufficiency. 
Hypernatremia is typically associated with dehydration; complications include seizures, cerebral edema, renal injury, fever, and lethargy.
Infants may appear relatively well.
Point-of-care sodium measurements yield quick results.
Hyponatremia severe enough to cause seizures is typically at ≤125 mmol/L.
Hypernatremia is defined as ≥147 mmol/L and is severe at >160 mmol/L. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Treat symptomatic hyponatremia with 3% hypertonic sodium chloride 3-5 mL/kg IV over 30-60 min. 
The goal is to stop seizures and correct to 125-130 mmol/L.
After attaining the goal, avoid further overly rapid correction.
After emergency resolution of the symptoms, the goal is to increase the serum sodium level by no more than 1 mmol/L/h. 
Symptomatic hypernatremia is treated with fluid rehydration, typically with normal saline.
Avoid overly rapid correction; the goal is a decrease in serum sodium by no more than 0.5-1 mmol/L/h.",Neonatal Emergencies
"Deep Dive - Intestinal Catastrophes
Background
Epidemiology
Midgut malrotation may be as prevalent as 1:200 patients, but symptoms only develop in 1:5,000. 
20% of these cases present in the first month of life. 
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in full-term infants occurs at a rate of 0.7/1,000 live births, accounting for 10% of the overall cases of NEC. The majority occur in pre-term infants. 
Term infants with NEC usually present in the first week of life, at d 3-4 on average. 
Omphalitis is rare in developed countries due to cord care at birth; the incidence is 7:1,000 live births. 
The typical age at onset is 5-9 d old.
Hirschsprung’s disease occurs in 1:5,000, and many present in the neonatal period, commonly with failure to pass meconium in the first 48 h or symptoms of obstruction. 
Despite classic teaching that the majority are diagnosed as neonates, recent data show that only 6.5% present in the neonatal period. 
Among children with Hirschsprung’s disease, 10% develop enterocolitis, which may be severe and may progress to toxic megacolon. 
Pathophysiology
Malrotation is a failure of normal fetal development of midgut rotation and fixation. As a result, the bowel may twist, cutting off the blood supply and causing ischemia.
The pathophysiology behind NEC is unclear but may include the presence of pathogenic bacteria in a susceptible at-risk infant. 
Premature birth, enteral feeds, and peri- and post-partum stress are risk factors.
Omphalitis results from poor umbilical hygiene and infection, which may progress to necrotizing fasciitis of the surrounding tissue. 
Hirschsprung’s disease is a congenital lack, or insufficiency, of neural ganglions in the anus. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Midgut Volvulus
The key historical finding or observation is bilious (green) vomitus. 
Any neonate with bilious vomiting, even if well-appearing, should be evaluated for midgut volvulus and have a Pediatric Surgery consultation.
Physical exam may be benign early on and then progress to include abdominal distension, tenderness, signs of peritonitis, and shock with poor perfusion.
Lab tests include CBC and blood cultures to screen for associated sepsis, blood chemistries, bedside glucose, and type and screen in anticipation of potential surgery.
Plain abdominal radiographs, supine and cross-table lateral, may show signs of malrotation, obstruction, or free air.
20% of patients have a normal plain radiograph. 
Definitive diagnosis is through upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast study, showing a classic corkscrew appearance of the jejunum. 
U/S is increasingly recognized as a useful diagnostic tool, showing the “whirlpool sign” with color Doppler. 
Necrotizing Enterocolitis
Symptoms vary and may include poor feeding, vomiting, abdominal distension, irritability, lethargy, and hematochezia. 
Presentation may mimic sepsis, and patients may have temperature instability, apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension. 
Physical exam may reveal abdominal distension and tenderness, abdominal wall erythema, or crepitance. 
Lab tests should be obtained to screen for associated sepsis and other abnormalities. 
CBC may reveal leukocytosis, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia.
Blood chemistries may reveal electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hyponatremia or hypoglycemia.
Obtain venous blood gas and lactate; the degree of metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis may be prognostic.
Coagulation studies may be abnormal.
Blood cultures should be obtained.
Plain abdominal radiographs, supine and cross-table lateral, may show pneumatosis intestinalis (air in the bowel walls, causing a “train track” appearance), portal venous gas in the right upper quadrant, or free air indicating intestinal perforation. 
More severe pneumoperitoneum results in a “football sign” of central football-shaped lucency of air on the abdominal radiograph.
Although radiographs may initially be normal, the combination of typical clinical picture plus developing radiographic abnormalities is used to diagnose NEC.
Omphalitis
Omphalitis presents as erythema of the skin around the base of the cord. 
Omphalitis can be differentiated from skin irritation due to the cord being pressed down on the skin by the diaper, since it is more circumferential, tender, and warm and does not fade when the diaper is opened and the cord is lifted off of the area.
Patients may have fever, lethargy, purulent, or malodorous umbilical discharge and ultimately progression to necrotizing fasciitis with discoloration and crepitance of the periumbilical skin.
Lab tests should be obtained to screen for associated sepsis and other abnormalities: 
CBC may show leukocytosis.
C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated.
Blood chemistries and bedside glucose should be checked and corrected as indicated; sodium may be low if necrotizing fasciitis is present.
Portal vein thrombosis may result in abnormal LFTs or coagulopathy. 
Blood cultures and culture of umbilical discharge or periumbilical skin surfaces should be obtained.
Although omphalitis is often a clinical diagnosis, imaging is sometimes obtained to support the diagnosis or when considering other diagnoses. 
Plain abdominal radiograph may show SC air.
U/S or CT may show fluid between the SC fat and muscle consistent with necrotizing fasciitis.
Hirschsprung-associated Enterocolitis
Suspect Hirschsprung’s disease in infants with a history of delayed meconium passage or lack of stool output.
Patients may have signs of obstruction such as abdominal distension, feeding intolerance, and bilious or feculent vomiting. 
Enterocolitis presents with explosive diarrhea, severe abdominal distension, fever, and vomiting and may progress to septic shock, pneumatosis intestinalis, or pneumoperitoneum (toxic megacolon).
It may be misdiagnosed as severe gastroenteritis.
Lab tests should be obtained to screen for associated sepsis and other abnormalities: 
CBC may reveal leukocytosis or neutropenia.
Blood chemistries and bedside glucose may reveal electrolyte abnormalities, severe dehydration, and hypoglycemia.
Obtain venous blood gas and lactate; the degree of metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis may be prognostic.
Coagulation studies may be abnormal.
Blood cultures should be obtained.
Plain abdominal radiographs: 
Show a paucity of gas in the rectum due to aganglionosis.
May show signs of obstruction such as pathologic air fluid levels and dilated loops of bowel.
As the disease progresses, it may show free air, pneumoperitoneum, or pneumatosis intestinalis.
Once the patient is stabilized, definitive diagnosis is usually by rectal biopsy. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Midgut Volvulus
Consult a pediatric surgeon as soon as the diagnosis is considered.
Patients can deteriorate rapidly, progressing to bowel necrosis within a few hours of presentation. 
Definitive treatment is operative.
Resuscitation and supportive care prior to surgery is essential.
Obtain reliable vascular access, make the patient nil per os, fluid resuscitate, and correct any hypoglycemia or electrolyte abnormalities.
Decompress the stomach with a nasogastric or orogastric tube.
Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole.
Necrotizing Enterocolitis
Initial management is often medical, but a pediatric surgeon should be consulted as soon as the diagnosis is considered, since surgical intervention is needed in up to 50% of cases. 
Patients should be nil per os and receive IV fluid resuscitation and maintenance fluid.
Decompress the stomach with a nasogastric or orogastric tube.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started as soon as possible, such as ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole.
Omphalitis
Consult a pediatric surgeon as soon as the diagnosis is considered, as for any patient with necrotizing fasciitis.
Administer broad-spectrum IV antibiotics covering Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobes, such as vancomycin, gentamicin, and metronidazole. 
Patients should be nil per os, receive IV fluid resuscitation and maintenance fluid, and other needed standard resuscitative measures.
Hirschsprung-associated Enterocolitis
Consult a pediatric surgeon and pediatric gastroenterologist as soon as the diagnosis of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis is suspected.
Provide standard supportive care including aggressive fluid resuscitation and make the patient nil per os.
Decompress the stomach with a nasogastric or orogastric tube.
Decompress the rectum with a rectal tube.

"Deep Dive - Toxicologic Causes
Background
Epidemiology
A study of 10 y of National Poison Data System files found that 1.1% of calls were regarding infants ≤6 mo old, and only 0.9% of exposures resulted in a moderate or severe effect or death. 
During the 10-y period, there were 3 neonatal deaths due to methamphetamine or phencyclidine.
2017 data showed 2,618 exposures per 100,000 population for the age group <1 y old. 
This age group, which is likely predominantly infants outside the neonatal age range, had only 4 fatalities.
Pathophysiology
Common mechanisms of exposure are unintentional (including caretaker recreational drugs and carbon monoxide) and dosing errors, either by caretakers or clinicians. 
Other mechanisms include exposure through breastfeeding and intentional malicious exposure (eg, caretakers attempting to sedate the infant).
Finally, neonates exposed to drugs in utero may experience withdrawal symptoms.
Diagnostic Considerations
Practitioners must maintain a high index of suspicion for a toxicological cause.
Inquire regarding medications administered (including non-prescription and folk remedies) and dosing, substances present that could possibly cause unintentional exposure, and maternal medications in breastfeeding mothers.
Exposures that have been reported in neonates include the following:
Accidental overdose of therapeutic acetaminophen, caffeine, digoxin, or other medication due to misunderstanding by the caretakers.
Carbon monoxide exposure, which may affect the neonate more severely than other larger members of the family.
Unintentional exposure to caretaker recreational drugs, such as methamphetamines and phencyclidine.
Unlike in adults, phencyclidine exposure in infants may result in lethargy or obtundation.
Methemoglobinemia due to excessive topical EMLA or associated with diarrheal illness (thought to be due to bacterial reduction of nitrates to nitrites).
Intentional or unintentional (due to a mix-up of liquids stored in the refrigerator) exposure to alcohol.
Magnesium overdose from medications given to treat constipation.
Fatality in a breastfed infant of a mother taking codeine.
Isopropyl alcohol intoxication from excessive use on the umbilical cord site.
Inadvertent oral administration of topical imidazoline drops.
Attempted therapeutic or malicious use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication.
Lab screening includes bedside glucose, urine or serum toxicology screens, and drug-specific/alcohol levels if available.
Urine toxicology screen for common drugs of abuse may reveal an unexpected cause of the infant’s symptoms.
Therapeutic Considerations
● Therapies and antidotes are specific to the exposure.
Neonates cannot be given activated charcoal unless they are intubated for airway protection and administered charcoal via a nasogastric tube.
Neonatal exposures leading to serious illness are more likely to be liquid, inhaled, or topical and are therefore not amenable to activated charcoal.

"Deep Dive - Seizures
Background
Epidemiology
Incidence of neonatal seizures is 1-3/1,000 live births. 
The incidence in preterm infants is up to 10× higher.
Most occur within the first few days and over one half occur in the first week of life.
Pathophysiology
Potential etiologies of neonatal seizures include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, central nervous system malformations (which may be undiagnosed at the time of ED presentation), intracranial hemorrhage, neonatal meningitis or central nervous system herpes infection, metabolic abnormalities (eg, related to undiagnosed inborn errors of metabolism), and hypoglycemia.
Neonates are susceptible to hyponatremia from water intoxication if caretakers feed them inappropriately, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has also been associated with hyponatremia. 
Neonates born to substance-abusing mothers may have seizures as part of opioid withdrawal syndrome.
Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, a rare (1/400,000-800,000 live births) autosomal recessive disorder, can cause intractable neonatal seizures that are unresponsive to standard anticonvulsant therapies. 
Benign familial and non-familial neonatal seizures may occur, usually beginning in the first week of life and resolving in 2 wk to 6 mo. 
Infantile spasms more commonly present between 3 and 7 mo of age, but may present as early as the first week of life. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Neonatal seizures are often not generalized tonic-clonic and may be subtle and difficult to recognize.
Seizures may present as myoclonic jerks (although benign myoclonic jerks can occur with sleep), coarse tremors or pronounced jitteriness, episodes of change in tone, exaggerated startle responses, bicycling or swimming movements, thrashing of the arms and legs, lip smacking, tongue thrusting, and eye blinking. 
Infantile spasms present as clusters of stereotyped neck, trunk, and extremity muscle spasms, commonly described as “salaam seizures.”
Point-of-care glucose, sodium, and calcium levels should be measured to rule out an easily correctable cause of seizure.
A urine toxicology screen may reveal an underlying cause.
Birth history may reveal an underlying etiology of the seizures.
Brain imaging and lumbar puncture may play a role in diagnosing the underlying etiology once the patient is stabilized.
Therapeutic Considerations
Initiate supportive care with attention to airway management and correction of hypoxia.
Treat seizures initially as for any pediatric patient in status epilepticus, starting with benzodiazepines.
If no IV access has been obtained, intranasal midazolam 0.2 mg/kg may be used.
Phenobarbital has been classically identified as the drug of choice when medication beyond benzodiazepines is needed, although levetiracetam may be as, or more, effective and is known to be safe in neonates. 
If status epilepticus is unresponsive to standard therapy, consider an initial empiric dose of pyridoxine 100 mg IV for possible pyridoxine-responsive epilepsy.",Neonatal Emergencies
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Identify any known prenatal concerns or whether multiple gestations are expected.
Assess the amniotic fluid color, if able.
Determine the gestational age (GA), if able.
Resuscitation may be considered starting at a confirmed GA of 22 wk (or estimated GA of 20 wk, when unknown).
If dates are unknown, fetal age is presumed to be over 20 wk if a uterine fundus is palpable above the mother’s umbilicus.
Assess tone, color, and breathing.
Follow the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) resuscitation algorithm.
Call the NICU (neonatologist or pediatrician).
RESUSCITATION (*indicates special consideration for preterm infant) Algorithm
Place neonate on a radiant warmer to maintain normothermia of 36.5°C to 37.5°C.
Apply a hat or cover the scalp with a blanket, if available, to retain warmth.
Avoid the use of heating pads due to the risk of burns.
Preterm neonate: Place in a food-grade plastic bag up to the neck if <32 wk GA.
Position the airway and clear secretions.
Place a towel roll under the shoulders.
Suction the mouth (followed by nose) only if needed to clear the airway.
Stimulate with gentle, brief rubbing of the back, trunk, or extremities.
Preterm neonate: Avoid drying if <32 wk GA.
Dry full-term neonates.
Within the first minute, if heart rate (HR) is <100 bpm, then start positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) with 21% FiO2 at a rate of 40-60 breaths per min.
Attach 3-lead cardiac monitor for HR assessment and SpO2 (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) monitor to the right hand (pre-ductal oxygen saturation).
Pre-ductal SpO2 at 1 min of life is approximately 65-70% and increases by 5% per min (ie, 70-75% at 2 min of life) until 5 min of life.
Target SpO2 at 10 min of life is 85-95%.
If HR <100 persists:
Reposition airway
Ensure good chest movement
Consider intubation or use of laryngeal mask airway (LMA)
If HR is <60:
Intubate with endotracheal tube (ETT):
ETT size: Based on age/weight
Laryngoscope blade size: Based on age/weight Table
Oxygenate with 100% FiO2.
Start chest compressions using a ratio of 3 compressions to 1 breath (90 compressions and 30 breaths per minute).
Establish access via umbilical vein (UV), peripheral intravenous (IV), or intraosseous (IO) line.
If HR remains <60 bpm, then give UV/IV/IO epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg) of 1:10,000 concentration. Repeat every 3 to 5 min.
If continued HR <60 bpm, then consider hypovolemia, anemia, and pneumothorax:
Hypovolemia: Treat with 0.9% sodium chloride 10 mL/kg.
Hemorrhagic shock/anemia: Treat with 10 mL/kg O-negative packed red blood cells (pRBC).
Pneumothorax: Treat with 18-gauge catheter needle decompression or 10 French chest tube.

Key Concepts
The NRP algorithm guidelines should be the starting point for the management of all nascent neonates, but the NRP is particularly important for those in extremis.
Emergency evaluation of the newborn should be framed by three questions:
Was it a term birth?
Does the neonate have good tone?
Is the neonate breathing or crying effectively?
Negative responses to any of the above questions should prompt further evaluation and likely initiation of resuscitation procedures.
Positive responses to all questions and no additional provider concerns indicate that resuscitation is likely not needed and the infant can stay with the mother.
PEARLS
Neonatal distress and arrest are typically respiratory rather than cardiac in etiology, although severe anemia and congenital medical conditions, including cardiac anomalies, should also be considered.
PPV is the mainstay of initial therapy.
PITFALLS
Use of preductal (right upper extremity) pulse oximetry is crucial; however, goal saturations must be based on the time since delivery and should not target 100% saturation.
NRP was designed for use in the first hours to days of life. Although controversy exists regarding when to change to Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), a good guide is assessing for the etiology of symptoms:
PEARLS
In neonates with respiratory symptoms, NRP is likely most appropriate.
After transition, PALS is often considered the mainstay of management and is generally used for cases of trauma or sepsis.
For the management of trauma, sepsis, and other non-resuscitative emergencies in neonates, see the chapter on neonatal emergencies. (See Chapter: Neonatal Emergencies)
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: A neonate is born precipitously in the emergency department (or en route) and appears blue, limp, and not breathing.
85% of full-term infants will breathe spontaneously within the first 30 s of life and require no additional management. 
10% of full-term infants will breathe once dried and stimulated. 
3% of full-term infants will respond and breathe after PPV. 
2% of full-term infants require intubation for respiratory support. 
0.1% of full-term infants require chest compressions and epinephrine to achieve transition. 
There are no studies regarding the number of ED deliveries that result in resuscitation, so it is unclear how many of these typically precipitous deliveries require intervention.
Neonatal deaths account for approximately 44% of worldwide pediatric deaths in children under 5 y old. 
Approximately 25% of neonatal deaths worldwide are due to the failure to initiate or sustain breathing. 
As many as 36% of neonatal deaths worldwide are related to complications of preterm deliveries; another 23% are related to intrapartum complications; 15% are due to sepsis. 
The relevant history includes the mother’s last menstrual period, extent of prenatal care, history of maternal pregnancy-related problems (ie, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia), amniotic fluid color, and timing of rupture of membranes.
Typically, the tone is limp, color is blue/pale, and respiratory effort is absent or poor in those that require extensive resuscitation.
No routine laboratory or imaging studies are necessary for emergent care.
Treatment (Interventions)
PEARLS
PPV with bag-valve mask, initially with FiO2 of 21%, and increase FiO2 as needed.
Chest compressions (hands circling the chest with thumbs providing compressions over the lower one-third of the sternum) in a 3:1 ratio of compressions to breaths.
Intubation as above.
Epinephrine
IV/IO: 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg) 1:10,000 every 3-5 min
ETT (not ideal): 0.05-0.1 mg/kg (0.5-1 mL/kg) of 1:10,000
PITFALLS
Hypovolemia: Give 0.9% sodium chloride 10 mL/kg. Not the 20mL/kg typical for other pediatric patients.
PEARLS
Hemorrhagic shock: Give 10 mL/kg O-negative pRBC.
Pneumothorax: Treat with 18-gauge catheter or 10 French chest tube.
There is no role for sodium bicarbonate.
PITFALLS
There is no role for naloxone.
Disposition
Admission
Typically, all nascent newborns are admitted to a newborn nursery.
A neonate who did not require resuscitation beyond warming and stimulation may be dischargeable after an appropriate neonatal exam and with close primary care provider follow-up, if the parent chooses.
The specific location for admission varies from hospital to hospital depending on the available resources.
In general, for cases in which minimal resuscitation is needed, a lower level of care, such as a transitional nursery, is adequate.
For cases in which significant resuscitation is required, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission is necessary.
Charting Pearls
Have a resuscitative team member note when key elements of resuscitation occurred:
Identify the time of delivery (to guide expected oxygenation and timing for interventions; also helpful for legal purposes).
Also identify:
Time of PPV initiation
Time of intubation
Time of compression initiation
Time of medication administration
Record the APGAR at 10 min, when available and if resuscitative efforts allow (the authors feel this can be assigned retrospectively).",Neonatal Resuscitation
"Deep Dive
Background
The normal laboring process has physiologic effects on the fetus, with contractions causing temporarily impaired oxygen delivery.
Upon delivery, the fetal circulation rapidly undergoes a shift in physiology:
Clamping of the umbilical cord increases systemic vascular resistance.
Blood flow through the ductus venosus decreases and gradually closes over the first 3-7 d, thereby increasing blood flow to the inferior vena cava.
Lung expansion causes a decrease in pulmonary vascular pressure, which increases right atrial flow.
The increase in right atrial flow ceases the flow through the foramen ovale, which then closes almost immediately.
These alterations in blood flow through the ductus arteriosus ultimately result in its closure, typically within the first week of life.
Therefore, obtaining a pulse oximetry on the right hand (pre-ductal) gives the most accurate assessment of central oxygen levels.
This process also explains the gradual shift in appropriate oxygen levels from <65% at birth to 85-95% at 10 min of age. 
The initiation of respiration is the first task in neonates.
Negative-pressure respiratory support aids in fluid absorption in the lungs and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance.
The normal neonatal heart rate is 120-160 beats per minute, and respiratory compromise or apnea can rapidly result in bradycardia and even cardiac arrest due to low respiratory reserve volumes. 
PEARLS
The normal neonatal respiratory rate is 40-60 breaths per minute. 
Multiple maternal factors increase prenatal stress on the fetus, which may result in higher risk deliveries. These factors should prompt the provider to anticipate higher resuscitation requirements upon delivery, and include:
Active infection
Gestational diabetes
Gestational hypertension
Illicit drug use
Lack of prenatal care
Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia
Prescription or hospital-administered drug use (including general anesthesia or magnesium therapy) 
Pregnancy complications and fetal factors also play a role in an increased likelihood of resuscitation requirements:
Multiple gestation (particularly <35 wk)
Oligo- or polyhydramnios
Hydrops fetalis
Fetal congenital malformations
Premature rupture of membranes (rupture before labor begins) or prolonged rupture (>18 h)
Preterm delivery (<36 wk)
Non-reassuring fetal heart rate or bradycardia
Meconium-stained amniotic fluid
Breech presentation
Shoulder dystocia
Nuchal cord
Emergency cesarean section
Particularly for placental abruption, prolapsed cord, or maternal resuscitation 
Neonates are classified by their gestational age (weeks from last menstrual period), which often correlates with the anticipated needs for resuscitation.
Extremely preterm (≤27 6/7 wk) infants often require the highest level of resuscitation and have worse overall outcomes than the other categories. 
Very preterm (28 0/7 to 31 6/7 wk) infants often require significant support at birth. 
Moderate to late preterm (32 0/7 to 36 6/7 wk) infants often require a degree of support, but some may require little to no additional measures immediately. 
Term (37 0/7 to 41 6/7 wk) infants typically require the fewest interventions. These infants are subcategorized to further risk stratify, with the infants born at 39 0/7 to 40 6/7 wk typically requiring the fewest resuscitative measures.
Early term: 37 0/7 through 38 6/7 wk
Full term: 39 0/7 through 40 6/7 wk
Late term: 41 0/7 through 41 6/7 wk 
Post-term (≤42 0/7 wk) infants begin to have increasing requirements again due to potential intrauterine stress and placental compromise. 
If the GA is not available, other methods can be used.
Pre-delivery measurement of the distance of the uterine fundus from the pubic symphysis can estimate the GA for single gestations. The measurement in centimeters should correspond to the GA in weeks within 15 days. 
Pre-delivery, ultrasound may also be used to estimate whether the fetus is term by measuring the biparietal diameter (typically ~5 cm at 20 wk).
Estimation based on weight is highly inaccurate, but may help with determining equipment and prognosis.
Infants weighing <500 g are likely <24 wk old and have a poor prognosis.
If an infant is between 1 and 1.5 kg, then he/she is likely to be 27-30 wk old (based on the fiftieth percentile weight for GA).
Infants >2.5 kg are typically >35 wk old and often have lower resuscitation needs with higher survival rates. 
PERSPECTIVES
Ballard scoring can also be used to determine the gestational age. This is a detailed chart, but for purposes of the ED, the authors feel the following several key elements may help determine an estimated age. Table
Posture: As the neonate develops, there is gradual flexion of the extremities; when healthy, the full-term infant will present with flexion of all extremities symmetrically while at rest, whereas the extremely preterm infant lacks the muscle tone to lie in this position (less useful in a critically ill, floppy neonate).
Lanugo: In the extremely preterm infant, there is no lanugo (fine body hair covering the fetus); it appears in patches and then is heavy in moderately preterm infants before it begins to become sparse again, resulting in a mostly bald post-term neonate.
Skin: In the extremely preterm infant, the skin is transparent and friable; the skin gradually increases in thickness to reach the thick skin of a post-term infant, which may present with cracking.
Eyes/ears: In early development, the eyelids remain fused, and the pinna sits flat or folded against the head. Very preterm infants may have open eyes, but the pinna continues to develop until the cartilage is firm with instant recoil in the full-term infant.
Foot: The size of the neonate’s foot increases over time and gradually develops the characteristic creases, which aid in identifying the age of the neonate.
Diagnostic Considerations
A primary survey/physical exam of the neonate should guide the extent of resuscitation.
APGAR scoring is typically used in neonatal resuscitation; however, APGAR scoring does not necessarily need to be completed immediately and can be delayed to allow for appropriate resuscitative efforts.  Knowledge of this scoring system is important for outcome predictions, because a score of 0 at 10 min has poor prognostic implications. Scoring is typically carried out at 1 and 5 min and comprises 5 categories, each with a score of 0-2. A score of 10 is rare and describes a fully transitioned neonate.  Table
All preterm infants are at risk for poor lung compliance because of insufficient surfactant, intraventricular hemorrhage due to fragile germinal matrices in the ventricles, and hypothermia due to thin skin, which impairs thermoregulation. 
PITFALLS
Depending on an ED’s access to care and length of transport, the administration of surfactant might be indicated before transport to definitive care. This should be completed only in conjunction with a neonatologist and pharmacy. There are significant risks, including airway obstruction, desaturations, and bradycardia. The current guidelines recommend endotracheal administration within 30 min of delivery in neonates <24 wk, or within 2 h if a neonate is >24 wk and intubated or requiring noninvasive ventilation and signs of respiratory compromise. 
The smallest infant reported to have survived was 268 g at birth and the earliest gestational age reported to have survived was reportedly 21 wk 4 d gestation, although these are notable outliers and should not be considered anticipated outcomes. 
While no routine laboratory or imaging studies are typically necessary, some may be considered under specific circumstances:
Point-of-care blood glucose may be helpful in small- or large-for-gestational-age neonates, infants of diabetic mothers, those with growth restriction, or those who appear lethargic, irritable, or tremulous. The acceptable glucose levels of neonates are notably different than for other pediatric patients or adults:
Hypoglycemia in the first 1-4 h of life is considered at levels <40 mg/dL (some texts say 30 mg/dL if asymptomatic).
From 4-24 h of life, glucose should be >45 mg/dL.
If there is a risk of hypoglycemia, some suggest treating at levels <50 mg/dL. 
Type and screen may be helpful in severe anemia, but when unavailable, O-negative blood should be used if urgently needed.
Chest X-ray may help confirm ETT placement, may help evaluate for a suspected pneumothorax, or may help assess for certain congenital anomalies such as diaphragmatic hernia. 
Therapeutic Considerations
PEARLS
After delivery, there is some evidence that a delay in clamping the umbilical cord of 30 to 60 s in otherwise healthy infants is beneficial.  In patients in extremis, clamping should occur so that the infant can be moved to a baby warmer and care can be directed to the baby more efficiently. There is some evidence in animal models that milking or delayed clamping in preterm infants may be detrimental. 
If the neonate is term, drying and stimulating is important. Keeping a neonate warm is achieved with a baby warmer or, when the neonate and mother are otherwise stable, direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother (ie, placed on the mother’s chest). Preterm or low-birth-weight neonates require supplemental adjuncts to help maintain core temperature, such as being covered with insulating material (eg, food-grade plastic), and should not be dried because the skin is very thin and tears more readily than that of term infants. 
Minimal handling of preterm neonates is ideal, because several complications have been correlated with increased interventions and contact, including infections and intraventricular hemorrhage. 
If indicated, gentle suctioning should be performed first via the mouth, then the nose. Deep suctioning has been associated with both vagal response (bradycardia) and with tissue damage, and should be avoided if possible. 
Routine intubation to facilitate deep suctioning for non-vigorous neonates in the setting of meconium-stained fluid is no longer recommended by NRP’s 7th edition. 
HR is most reliably assessed via 3-lead ECG monitoring. Chest auscultation, palpation of umbilical pulse, and pulse oximetry are less accurate for HR assessments. 
Pulse oximetry should be used when resuscitation is anticipated. The preductal location is indicated, and the probe should be placed on the right upper extremity. 
Airway positioning should be a focus, with neonates having a large occiput in relation to the body, which may occlude their small airways. Placing a towel roll under the shoulders may help open the airway. 
PITFALLS
Oxygenation should not be aggressive. Hyperoxia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Room air (21% oxygen) is sufficient during the initial stages of resuscitation. Pre-ductal goal SpO2 at 1 min of life is 65-70% and increases by ~5% per min. The target SpO2 at 10 min of life is 85-95%. If the HR is <60 after 90 s of resuscitation at lower oxygen concentration, the oxygen concentration may be increased to 100% until the HR recovers. 
PPV may begin with an inflation pressure of 20 cm H2O at a rate of 40-60 breaths per minute. An inflation pressure of 30-40 cm H2O may be required. The use of a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve is recommended, with 5 cm of H2O of PEEP suggested. 
Most neonates respond to PPV. If PPV is ineffective, the “MR SOPA” mnemonic may be used to improve ventilation: M = mask (adjust mask for good seal), R = reposition the airway, S = suction the mouth then nose, O = open the mouth with a jaw thrust, P = increase pressure until there is chest rise, and A = airway control (ie, ETT). 
LMA may be considered for neonates >34 wk gestation, if face-mask ventilation or endotracheal intubation is unsuccessful. LMA is also a good option in neonates with atypical facial features, such as those associated with specific syndromes, micrognathia, Pierre Robin sequence, or with masses that may obstruct the airway or limit the view with a laryngoscope. It has been noted that LMA may obviate the need for endotracheal intubation, and can be placed within the time frame recommended by neonatal resuscitation guidelines.  Note: the smallest size of LMA is size 1 and is designed for use in infants up to 5 kg. Typically, the airway of preterm infants is too small for this to be appropriately placed. 
Endotracheal intubation is indicated if bag-mask ventilation is ineffective, chest compressions are commenced, or special circumstances such as a diaphragmatic hernia are identified or suspected. The confirmation of endotracheal tube placement is achieved by a CO2 detector and radiograph, as well as clinical indicators such as chest rise, presence of bilateral breath sounds, and condensation in the tube. 
Endotracheal tube size is generally 3.5 for the term (>38-wk) neonate. For the <28-wk preterm neonate, the endotracheal tube size is generally 2.5. Table
Tube depth is often estimated to be 3 the ETT size in neonates, as in older patients; however, particularly for babies <750 g (and likely up to 1500 g), the oro-helical length (lip to the helical tubercle of the ear) may be used as an alternative estimate for tube depth.  EM:RAP Audio
The airway of a neonate is often very anterior, so a sharper-than-usual bend in the stylet may be required to successfully intubate the patient. Photo
A shoulder roll, as mentioned previously, is often necessary for the successful intubation of a neonate. 
The airway may also have a different appearance, with poor visualization of the vocal cords due to their anterior positioning and a more floppy and U-shaped epiglottis. This makes the miller blade useful for displacement of the epiglottis. 
Chest compressions are initiated when the HR is <60 with adequate ventilation. The rate is 3 compressions to 1 breath (90 compressions to 30 breaths per minute). The neonate is preferably compressed using the two-thumb technique, at the lower third portion of the sternum, with a compression depth of one-third of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest. Increase FiO2 concentration to 100% when compressions are initiated. 
It is rare that medications will be necessary in newborn resuscitation; however, if the HR remains < 60 despite the interventions above, epinephrine may be administered at a dose of 0.01-0.03 mg/kg of 1:10,000 concentration via UV/IV/IO. There is very limited evidence for this dosing. There is also limited support for the use of endotracheal epinephrine, but when used, it is recommended to be given as 0.05-0.1 mg/kg (0.5-1 mL/kg) of 1:10,000. 
To obtain access on a neonate, there are several options including the typical IV or IO routes. The umbilical vein should be considered early as an ideal point of access that requires some general skill but is almost universally successful. 
Umbilical vein access can be obtained as follows: Figure
Identify the location of the umbilical arteries (typically there are 2), which have a thick wall and more-defined structure, and the umbilical vein, which is larger and has a thinner, less-defined wall.
Hold up the stump with forceps at the distal end.
Apply a bactericidal agent (eg, betadine, chlorhexidine).
Loosely apply umbilical tape or suture material around the proximal end of the cord to prevent blood loss.
Carefully remove the distal end of the umbilical cord with a scalpel.
Insert the catheter into the vein while loosening the tape until the catheter passes beyond the tape and there is blood return. Continue an additional 1-2 cm (the total insertion should be 4-5 cm in a term infant), and then tighten the tape or suture material down and tape the catheter to the infant’s skin to hold in place. Do not advance further than necessary, because an inappropriately deep insertion has the potential to cause liver damage with certain infusions.
Note that this is for short-term access only. Longer-use catheters require deeper insertion and imaging to confirm placement, whereas catheters placed in emergent situations do not require imaging unless there are specific concerns. 
Volume expansion may be considered with 0.9% sodium chloride 10 mL/kg. If severe anemia is suspected, 10 mL/kg O-negative pRBC may be considered for hemorrhagic shock. 
After successful resuscitation, start an intravenous infusion at 60-80 mL/kg/d with dextrose 10% in water (D10W; 80-100 mL/kg/d for infants ≤26 wk), and consider therapeutic hypothermia. 
A neonatologist should be involved in the resuscitation as early as possible.
Special Considerations
In infants who fail to improve with the above measures or acutely worsen after PPV or intubation, pneumothorax should be considered.
Pneumothorax occurs with increasing frequency in smaller neonates; in full-term neonates, the rates are significantly less than 1%, whereas in neonates weighing less than 1500 g, pneumothorax occurs at a rate of 5-7%. 
Auscultation for pneumothorax in this age group is challenging because of the referred breath sounds being transmitted throughout the thorax.
Identification of a pneumothorax may be done by bedside chest X-ray if readily available.
PEARLS
Transillumination is a diagnostic tool that is useful only in the neonatal population. Placing a light against the chest wall should not result in illumination of the entire lateral chest cavity unless a pneumothorax is present. A pneumothorax will result in a translucent area of the chest. It is important to use unheated lights or do the exam quickly to avoid burning the neonate’s fragile skin. 
Bedside ultrasound has also been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity in small studies, but this method is not currently used uniformly as the test of choice in newborns. 
In infants with notable edema, hydrops should be considered and may result in pleural effusion. 
If a congenital diaphragmatic hernia is known or possible, then an orogastric (OG) or nasogastric (NG) tube can be placed to decompress the stomach, allowing for improved expansion of the lungs. 
For infants born with the externalization of intestinal contents (gastroschisis or omphalocele), an OG or NG could also be placed. The area should be quickly covered by a sterile saline-soaked gauze to protect the contents, and pediatric surgery should be contacted for emergent care. These patients should not be fed, and care should be taken to avoid excessive manipulation or pressure on the bowel, which could result in ischemia. 
In hypoglycemic neonates, treatment depends on the neonate’s medical history.
At-risk neonates include preterm, intrauterine growth-restricted, small for gestational age, large for gestational age infants, as well as infants of diabetic mothers. These infants should be fed within the first hour of life and have their glucose checked within 30 min after all feedings for the first 24 h of life. 
Typically, an infusion rate of 10% dextrose 4-7 mg/kg/min is used in term neonates.
Infants of diabetic mothers have shifts in metabolism, and dextrose at 3-5 mg/kg/min is recommended.
Intrauterine growth-restricted neonates require a higher rate of 6-8 mg/kg/min. 
Maternal opiate use may cause respiratory suppression in the neonate. This situation may require intubation, but the administration of naloxone is not recommended because it may precipitate withdrawal and result in neonatal seizures. 
Non-initiation and Termination of Resuscitation
At times, it is appropriate (and ethical) not to initiate resuscitation of a neonate, particularly if the neonate is born with signs of decomposition and has known non-survivable congenital malformations, or if it is confirmed that the gestational age is <22 wk (supported by physical exam), as well as in cases where the provider feels there is extremely low chance of survival. 
Neonates >22 wk but <24 wk can and should be resuscitated, with few exceptions.
It may be useful or necessary for the emergency provider to discuss survival rates and neurologic outcomes with parents. At 22 wk, survival is approximately 2-3%. Survival increases to 99% by 32 wk. Neonates that survive in the early weeks, particularly those <24 wk, have nearly 100% morbidity, which decreases to 70% by 25 wk. 
Occasionally, prenatal estimates are inaccurate, even in those patients with good prenatal care; therefore, any neonate appearing to be older than 20 wk based on weight and general assessment (as above) can be resuscitated, although with those that appear younger, non-initiation may be appropriate.
An obvious limitation to the above criteria is that if an extremely preterm neonate requires intubation, resuscitation will be restricted to the ETT sizes available. The lower limit of ETT is 2.5 uncuffed. If this cannot be placed due to airway size, resuscitative efforts may be terminated.
It is generally considered appropriate to consider the cessation of resuscitative efforts if a neonate remains pulseless after 10 min from the start of resuscitation (some suggest 20 min) or if the neonate does not develop a heart rate >60 and does not breathe spontaneously after 20 min of resuscitation.

"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
PRIMARY SURVEY
Non-accidental trauma may involve a critically ill patient with multisystem trauma. In this case, please see the chapter Pediatric Major Trauma Assessment.
CRITICAL INFORMATION
When non-accidental trauma is suspected, ensure patient safety and evaluate for life-threatening pathology. Involve law enforcement, child protective services, and hospital security early.
Laws vary by state, as do practices regarding the separation or non-separation of child protective services and social work services. Call 1-800-4-A-Child (1-800-422-4453) 24/7/365 in the United States or Canada for assistance in finding information regarding local child protective services. Most of this information is also available on the ChildHelp website: https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/.
Always perform a head computed tomography (CT) in a child <1 y old if non-accidental trauma head trauma is suspected (even without symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure [ICP]). Increased ICP will present late because the fontanels are open.
Stabilize and carefully evaluate the cervical spine of an abused child with Down syndrome due to the risk of atlanto-occipital instability. Consider cervical spine precautions in other non-accidental trauma victims based on mechanism or clinical signs.
Obtain labs for all children <7 y old and any child >7 y old where there is clinical indication, to include complete blood count, coagulation panel, comprehensive metabolic panel, amylase, lipase, and urinalysis.
Laboratory abnormalities combined with physical exam findings may suggest the need for abdominal and pelvic CT. Involve the trauma team early.
Obtain toxicology/ingestion screens when concerned for exposure, particularly in neglect cases.
A skeletal survey may be considered, but if you plan to admit the child, this can be deferred to the inpatient team. If a child is discharged after a negative skeletal survey, either with caregivers and child protective services follow-up or with emergency foster care placement, educate regarding the importance of a repeat skeletal survey 10-14 d after the first survey.
Disclose your concern to the caregiver without being accusatory. Focus on the type of injury and the importance of ensuring patient safety. Do not suggest potential mechanisms that could have caused the injury pattern.
Key Concepts
Non-accidental trauma, or physical abuse, accounts for nearly 20% of the approximately 1 million cases of child abuse and neglect each year in the United States.
Approximately 1,800 children in the United States and more than 150,000 children globally die each year following non-accidental trauma.
PEARLS
The majority of deaths occur in children under 4 y of age, with the highest rate of abuse and death occurring in children under 1 y of age.
Abusive head trauma accounts for 80% of all non-accidental trauma deaths and is fatal in 25% of cases.
Children with colic, developmental delay, chronic illness, and real or perceived behavioral problems are at highest risk.
PITFALLS
90% of abuse is perpetrated by parents and biological relatives.
Minorities are overreported for child abuse, whereas non-minorities and the affluent are underreported, leading to missed abuse cases.
PEARLS
The key to diagnosis is pattern recognition and consideration of non-accidental trauma in every patient encounter.
PITFALLS
Approximately 25% of abused children under 1 y of age have a previous sentinel injury on retrospective review.
PEARLS
The most common injury of abuse is bruising. The second most common injury is orthopedic fracture.
Diagnosis
Textbook presentation: An 8-month-old baby is brought in by mom’s boyfriend after reportedly jumping off a dresser. The baby has old-appearing bruises to his right upper arm and an obvious deformity to his left femur. He is arousable but drowsy.
Historical Clues
PEARLS
The story is inconsistent with the injury; the history is inconsistent with the developmental stage of the infant; the history changes over time or from different historians; and/or the level of caregiver concern is inappropriate.
Physical Exam Clues
PITFALLS
Bruises in pre-mobile infants represent abuse in more than 50% of cases.
Bruises in the shapes of hands or objects.
Bruises or other injuries in locations not typical for accidental injury (see “Deep Dive” for TEN-4 FACES).
Liquid burns that are symmetric, well demarcated, and/or exhibit stocking or glove feature shape; cigarette patterns; or burns in the shape of objects such as curling irons.
Radiologic Clues
PITFALLS
Any fracture in a pre-mobile child.
Humerus and femur fractures in children <18 mo old are significantly more likely to result from abuse than from accidental injury.
Multiple fractures at various stages of healing.
Any skull fracture that is not a simple, single linear fracture.
Classic fractures such as spiral long bone fractures, bucket handle fractures, corner fractures, sternal and scapular fractures (without substantiated history of major trauma), spinous process fractures, and posterior rib fractures.
PEARLS
Toddler fractures in the ambulatory child and nursemaid elbows are not high-risk injuries.
Disposition
PEARLS
Disposition decisions center primarily on whether the patient has a safe home environment to return to once all injuries have been stabilized and deemed appropriate for outpatient care.
PERSPECTIVES
Any child sent home must have follow-up plans established with child protective services and, ideally, a pediatrician, prior to discharge.
A low threshold for admission is highly recommended, because discharge planning may not be feasible in the Emergency Department (ED), particularly during late or weekend hours.",Non-Accidental Trauma in Children
"Deep Dive
PITFALLS
The most important role of the emergency physician, after stabilizing life-threatening pathology, is the recognition that abuse may have occurred. As many as 75% of abuse cases are missed in acute care settings. 
A history that does not fit the presentation is often the first indication of abuse:
A significant injury is present without a reasonable explanation.
There has been a delay in seeking care.
PEARLS
The history is inconsistent with the child’s developmental abilities, such as a child who cannot climb or walk reported to have jumped off a dresser.
The history is inconsistent upon repeated retellings.
Different caregivers and witnesses give different versions of the history.
There is an inappropriate level of caregiver concern, especially when the injury occurred as the result of poor supervision.
PITFALLS
Textbooks have often focused on obvious injury patterns, such as bruises in the shape of an adult hand or cigarette burns. However, more subtle injuries are missed in almost 60% of cases, and 27.5% of confirmed abuse cases in children <1 y old had a previous sentinel injury. 
PEARLS
Bruising is extremely rare in young infants and should prompt consideration of non-accidental trauma. Bruising occurs in <2% of infants who are <5 mo old, although <50% of these infants undergo abuse evaluations. 
Bruises in pre-mobile infants are the result of abuse in more than 50% of cases, and nearly 40% of abused infants have only one bruise. 
Remember TEN-4 FACES to recall injury types and locations not typical for accidental injury: 
Torso
Ears
Neck
<4 months old
Frenulum
Angle of jaw
Cheek
Eyelid
Subconjunctival hemorrhage
PEARLS
Burns are common injuries of childhood; however, inflicted burns have characteristic patterns.
Accidental scald burns, for example, are typically the result of splash or spill injuries, while inflicted scald burns are usually the result of a child being forced into scalding water.
Inflicted burns are symmetric, bilateral, well demarcated, and frequently spare the dependent body parts (such as the heels and buttocks) that are in contact with the bottom of a tub, for example, protecting that skin from the hot water.
Cigarette burns are typical of abuse as well, as are burns from objects such as curling irons and heater coils. 
PEARLS
Early ophthalmology consultation to look for retinal hemorrhage is an important component of the inpatient non-accidental trauma evaluation.
Ideally, an ophthalmological exam should take place within 72 h (preferably within 24 h), thus consultations should always be sought early. If the patient presents >72 h after the non-accidental trauma event, the exam is still warranted but loses its sensitivity.
ED evaluation of the eye primarily involves assessment for gross injury to the face or globe, as well as evaluation for signs of neurologic or intracranial pathology.
A fundoscopic exam may be helpful, but an exam, with full dilatation, by an ophthalmologist is ideal. 
PEARLS
Fractures are the second most common lesion in abused children.
The majority (90%) of fractures due to abuse occur in children <5 y of age. Half (50%) of fractures in children <1 y old and 30% of fractures in children <3 y old are due to abuse. 
PITFALLS
Femur fractures in children <18 mo old are the result of abuse in 25% of cases. With a suspicious history and/or evidence of prior trauma, this increases to more than 90%. 
Humerus fractures in children <18 mo carry an odds ratio of 32 for being the result of abuse rather than accidental. 
PITFALLS
CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis in non-accidental trauma are rarely positive. CTs should be obtained only in patients with absent or hypoactive bowel sounds, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase >2× normal, or two or more abnormal lab or exam findings. 
PEARLS
Orthopedic abuse injuries have classic radiographic appearances that all emergency physicians should be prepared to recognize.
High-specificity findings: 
Corner fractures
Bucket handle fractures
Posterior rib fractures
Scapula fractures

Special considerations
PITFALLS
Image all children <1 y old in whom non-accidental trauma is suspected due to the presence of open fontanels and typically absent or minimal clinical symptoms of increased ICP.
PERSPECTIVES
All children with Down syndrome must be spinally immobilized and carefully evaluated if non-accidental trauma is suspected, due to atlanto-occipital instability.
A follow-up skeletal survey is indicated for children with a negative initial survey 10-14 d after the initial presentation. However, if the pelvis, spine, hands, or skull images are negative upon the initial skeletal survey, the repeat survey may exclude those areas to limit radiation exposure. 
Remember important abuse mimics:
Hemangiomas
Nontender, subcutaneous, may multiply or grow larger with age. Use point-of-care ultrasound to inform the diagnosis.
“Mongolian spots” (congenital dermal melanocytosis)
Bluish green, nontender, fade with age, usually on the back and buttocks.
Henoch-Schönlein purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, leukemia, hemophilia, osteogenesis imperfecta
Cultural practices such as cupping and coining
PERSPECTIVES
Remember that spanking, paddling, and otherwise beating children should not be considered a cultural practice and should be evaluated carefully. The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on corporal punishment clearly states that spanking harms children.  However, spanking with an open hand on the buttocks without causing injury is not, in and of itself, considered abuse.
PERSPECTIVES
The goal of the emergency physician is always to ensure the safety of our patients. In the case of child abuse, and specifically non-accidental trauma, emergency physicians are on the front line. Our failure to recognize abuse can lead to the death of a child. Always consider abuse in every patient encounter, and do not hesitate to seek services for a child whose history arouses your concern. It is rare that an innocent parent will become angry at an effort to protect his/her child. If you anger a caregiver by expressing concern regarding your patient’s safety, feel reassured that you are acting appropriately and doing your job.",Non-Accidental Trauma in Children
"Rapid Access—The Undifferentiated Pediatric Patient with an Abdominal Complaint
Approach to the Critical Patient
AIRWAY/BREATHING
Provide supplemental oxygen and place on cardiorespiratory monitor.
CIRCULATION
Obtain intravenous (IV) access (ultrasound guidance, vein transilluminator) or intraosseous access.
Administer an isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg; reassess and repeat.
OTHER CRITICAL INFORMATION
Obtain cultures and administer antibiotics that cover intra-abdominal flora.
Obtain i-STAT labs, including glucose.
Provide pain control; consider morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg or fentanyl 1 μg/kg IV.
Community-acquired infections requiring antibiotics can usually be covered with:
Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV/IM (max 2 g) and metronidazole 10 mg/kg IV (max 500 mg).
Sepsis and hospital-acquired abdominal infections should include coverage for Pseudomonas with an antibiotic such as piperacillin-tazobactam 100 mg/kg IV (max 4.5 g). Local antibiograms should guide antibiotic choices.
Obtain early surgical consultation.
Key Concepts
The etiology of abdominal complaints varies widely by age. Table
Patients can be grouped in 3 age categories: Birth to 3 mo, 3 mo to 3 y, and 3 y to adolescence.
These age groupings can help guide the differential diagnosis but should not be considered all-inclusive or absolute. Some abdominal problems, such as constipation or appendicitis, can happen at any age.
This chapter will discuss a general approach, followed by a more detailed discussion of specific pediatric abdominal emergencies.
Abdominal emergencies in children have varied presentations:
Infants tend to present with lethargy or irritability and exhibit poor feeding or vomiting.
Older babies and toddlers may have no stools or bloody stools.
School-age children can present with fever or pain.
Teenagers start to present like adults but can bring an immaturity or emotional element to the presentation that makes the assessment challenging.
PEARLS
Several extra-abdominal problems cause significant abdominal pain in children, such as strep throat, lower lobe pneumonias, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
Check the urine.
PEARLS
Always examine the genitals.
PITFALLS
If constipation is found, the diagnosis is not necessarily complete.
When initial testing does not yield a certain diagnosis, serial exams have a role.
Pay special attention to red flags:
Bilious emesis
Lethargy
Severe pain or irritability
Peritoneal signs
Abdominal distension
Signs of sepsis
Inconsistent history
Diagnosis
History and physical exam will help narrow down and rank considerations.
Timing of symptoms
Description of pain
Activity levels
Appetite
Associated symptoms:
Fevers
Bowel movements
Characteristics of vomit
Urination
Other non-gastrointestinal symptoms
Past medical history should include pregnancy and birth history, known medical problems, and past surgeries.
A good social and family history is critical in a pediatric patient.
Physical exam must be complete, especially in the preverbal child.
Pay special attention to hydration status, masses, peritoneal signs, and genitalia.
Blood and urine tests (complete blood counts [CBC], comprehensive metabolic panel, lipase, C-reactive protein [CRP], urinalysis [UA]; tailor to the presentation).
Imaging modalities: ultrasound and X-ray are preferred over CT when appropriate to avoid radiation risks.
Ultrasound is now the initial test of choice for many diagnoses, including pyloric stenosis, intussusception, and appendicitis.
Supine and upright/lateral decubitus views for obstruction and free air.
Upper gastrointestinal series still has a role in diagnosing volvulus.
CT when other modalities have failed and to rule out life-threatening causes.
MRI and magnetic resonance enterography offer emerging possibilities without radiation.
Treatment
Correct dehydration and consider NPO (nothing by mouth) status.
Treat pain.
Cultures and antibiotics that cover abdominal sources such as piperacillin-tazobactam 100 mg/kg IV (max 4.5 g) q8h OR Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV/IM (max 2 g) and metronidazole 10 mg/kg IV (max 500 mg)
Consult surgery.
Initiate medical management.
Disposition
Home
PEARLS
Do not discharge a pediatric patient with a suspected abdominal emergency unless the emergency has been sufficiently ruled out with the appropriate diagnostic tests or in consultation with a surgeon. A period of observation for serial abdominal exams, either in the emergency department (ED) or as an inpatient, may be appropriate when the diagnosis is uncertain.
If discharging, use specific return precautions. Some patients present before a disease process has fully presented itself, as is often the case with appendicitis. Other diagnoses, such as intussusception, may require re-evaluation with repeat ultrasound if symptoms recur.
Admission/Surgery
Most abdominal emergencies are admitted to either a pediatric or surgery team.
Starred differential diagnoses are discussed in this chapter. Table",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders

"Rapid Access—Malrotation with Midgut Volvulus
Approach to the Critical Patient
Assess and correct for dehydration and signs of shock with an IV isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus at 20 mL/kg. Reassess and repeat as needed.
If required, dopamine is the preferred vasopressor due to its positive effect on splanchnic blood flow; starting dose: 3 μg/kg/min, titrate to effect. 
Obtain supine and upright/lateral decubitus abdominal radiographs to assess for perforation and screen for other congenital disorders such as duodenal atresia.
Place nasogastric tube if signs of gastric distension are present.
Do not delay pediatric surgical consultation for diagnostic studies in any patient in whom malrotation with volvulus is suspected.
Obtain cultures and administer antibiotics as described in the above section titled The Undifferentiated Pediatric Patient with an Abdominal Complaint.
Key Concepts
Midgut volvulus is a surgical emergency that occurs due to a congenital malrotation of the bowel and an abnormally fixed mesentery. Twisting of the abnormal mesenteric root on itself causes obstruction of the bowel, the superior mesenteric artery, and the superior mesenteric vein. Figure
It is essential to exclude this diagnosis in any neonate presenting with bilious vomiting.
Up to 75% of cases are diagnosed in the neonatal period; 90% are diagnosed within the first year of life. 
Diagnosis
PEARLS
Classic presentation is a neonate with sudden-onset bilious vomiting and constant, severe pain with minimal distension (because this is a high obstruction).
May have no prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) problems or, in slightly older infants, may have a history of difficult feeds and failure to thrive.
Partial obstructions can have an insidious onset with 2-3 wk of bilious vomiting.
Diagnostic test of choice: Traditionally diagnosed by upper GI series after placement of a nasogastric tube for decompression. This can assess the duodenal–jejunal junction, a critical anatomic landmark.  May show a corkscrew appearance of the distal duodenum and the proximal jejunum twisting around the mesentery. Figure
Recent literature supports the use of ultrasound for diagnosis.  May show the superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein in anatomically opposite positions; this is confirmatory but may not be sufficiently sensitive.  Doppler ultrasound may show the superior mesenteric vein swirling around the superior mesenteric artery. This “whirlpool sign” is also used for diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 92%. 
Supine and upright abdominal radiographs should be performed if perforation or other diagnosis is suspected. May show dilatation of the stomach and proximal duodenum (ie, the “double-bubble sign”); may be normal or non-specific. 
Laboratory studies: CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, type and screen, hemoccult stool (if stool available)
Treatment
Treat signs of dehydration and shock as above.
Nasogastric decompression if there are signs of distension, followed by upper GI series or ultrasound
Emergency surgical correction with Ladd procedure
Disposition
Home
Consider discussion with surgical consultants for well-appearing patients with equivocal studies in whom a diagnosis of malrotation is unlikely.
Admission
Admission for surgery for any patient in whom malrotation with or without midgut volvulus is suspected.
Consider admission for repeat upper GI or ultrasound in patients with equivocal studies and high suspicion for malrotation.
Operating Room/Surgery
Immediate operative intervention for malrotation with volvulus is indicated to prevent bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation.",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
"Rapid Access—Hirschsprung’s Enterocolitis
Approach to the Critical Patient
Assess and correct for dehydration and signs of shock with IV isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus at 20 mL/kg. Reassess and repeat as needed. After fluid resuscitation, start IV fluids at 1.5× maintenance and titrate to compensate for ongoing losses.
Do not delay surgical consultation.
Diagnostic imaging should follow to assess for signs of perforation and dilated colon.
Obtain cultures and administer antibiotics as described in The Undifferentiated Pediatric Patient with an Abdominal Complaint.
Some patients with continued shock will require vasopressors and ventilatory support with admission to the ICU.
Place rectal tube for decompression in fulminant disease.
Key Concepts
Hirschsprung’s disease is a congenital absence of ganglia in the colon, causing neurogenic dysfunction of the bowels impeding normal peristaltic function and, as a result, obstruction from the inability to pass normal stools.
Lengthier colonic involvement typically presents in infancy; however, cases involving only a few centimeters of aganglionic colon may present in childhood with significant chronic constipation.
Differentiate from simple constipation. Patients with Hirschsprung’s disease will have a history of constipation since birth and often failed to pass meconium in the first 48 h after birth. They have minimal to no pain, often a distended abdomen, and an empty rectal vault.
Enterocolitis and toxic megacolon are the feared complications of severe stool obstruction. Enterocolitis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with Hirschsprung’s disease.
A patient may present with enterocolitis even after surgical repair. A patient with Hirschsprung’s disease should not be considered to have acute viral gastroenteritis until they have been worked up for enterocolitis in conjunction with a pediatric surgeon. 
Patients with Hirschsprung’s disease and Down syndrome are at increased risk of enterocolitis. 
Diagnosis
Identifying patients with Hirschsprung’s disease is imperative to determining who is at risk of enterocolitis. Refer appropriate patients with chronic constipation to gastroenterology for possible biopsy.
Classic presentation of Hirschsprung’s enterocolitis includes abdominal distension, fever, and foul-smelling stool. Enterocolitis may also cause vomiting, explosive diarrhea, lethargy, rectal bleeding, and septic shock.
Diagnostic studies: Plain radiographs with 2 views of the abdomen to assess for obstruction, fecal impaction, and perforation.
Laboratory studies: CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, sepsis markers, blood cultures.
Treatment
All patients with suspected Hirschsprung’s enterocolitis should be considered critical. Please refer to the above section on the approach to the critical patient.
Patients with Hirschsprung’s disease who are not presenting with enterocolitis will need to be followed closely by a gastroenterologist for preventative measures, including daily rectal wash-outs. Definitive treatment is surgical removal of the aganglionic segment.
Disposition
Home
Most patients presenting with uncomplicated Hirschsprung’s disease constipation can be managed on an outpatient basis. Patients with enterocolitis should not be discharged.
Admission
Those with enterocolitis require admission. Consider a monitored bed and ICU-level care.
Operating Room/Surgery
Hirschsprung’s enterocolitis is an emergency. Rectal washouts are performed frequently in patients not suspected of having a perforation. Immediate colonic diversion is sometimes indicated.",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
"Rapid Access—Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis
Approach to the Critical Patient
Assess hydration status; treat signs of dehydration with 20 mL/kg bolus of isotonic crystalloid IV fluids (the use of lactated Ringer’s solution is discouraged due to worsening alkalosis). Reassess hydration status and repeat fluids as needed.
Obtain abdominal ultrasound.
Obtain surgical consultation.
Key Concepts
Pyloric stenosis is an idiopathic hypertrophy of the pylorus muscle causing gastric outlet obstruction in young infants.
Typically presents between 2 and 6 wk of age but has been seen as late as 20 wk of age.
Most common surgical diagnosis presenting with vomiting in this age group.
Occurs in 1 in 250 births, with a strong predisposition in males (4:1).
PEARLS
Key history: Progressively projectile non-bilious vomiting following feeds (early presentations may appear similar to reflux).
While this is a surgical diagnosis, the urgency of this condition lies in recognizing and treating the potentially profound dehydration and metabolic derangements.
Diagnosis
Classic presentation is a 3-wk-old first-born male with worsening non-bilious vomiting associated with meals, with continued interest in feeds.
Infant may appear dehydrated in protracted disease, but generally, these infants are well-appearing and without signs of abdominal discomfort.
An olive-size mass (ie, the hypertrophied pylorus) may be palpated in the epigastrium; however, with the advent of ultrasound and earlier diagnosis, this examination finding is rarely observed outside of the operating room.
Diagnostic test of choice: ultrasound, sensitivity approaches 100%.  Diagnosis is based on muscle wall thickness (>3 mm), channel length (>12-15 mm), and observed dynamic function of the pylorus.  Image Image
Upper gastrointestinal contrast study can confirm the diagnosis if ultrasound is not available or equivocal but carries the risk of vomiting and aspiration. A thread-like streak of contrast passing through the narrowed pyloric channel, also known as the “string sign,” may be observed on oblique views.
Lab work should include a basic metabolic panel, as gastric losses may contribute to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia. Such metabolic abnormalities are often a late finding, and the classic triad is rarely seen.
Treatment
Correct dehydration with normal saline bolus, and replenish electrolytes and glucose as needed.
Consult pediatric general surgery for pyloromyotomy.
This is not a true surgical emergency. Correction of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities should always occur before surgical correction. In some countries, pyloric stenosis is managed non-surgically with hydration and nutritional support until the infant outgrows the obstruction.
Disposition
Admission
Typically admitted to a surgical service with pediatric consultation to co-manage any metabolic abnormalities.
Operating Room/Surgery
Anticipated for all infants diagnosed with pyloric stenosis.",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
"Rapid Access—Incarcerated Hernias
Approach to the Critical Patient
Immediate surgical consultation should follow in any child with hernia as the suspected cause who is ill-appearing, has peritoneal signs, or has persistent vomiting.
signs, or has persistent vomiting and in whom a hernia is the suspected source.
If signs of perforation are present, obtain cultures and administer antibiotics as described in the above section titled The Undifferentiated Pediatric Patient with an Abdominal Complaint.
IV fluid resuscitation with a 20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus. Reassess and repeat as needed.
Key Concepts
The vast majority of pediatric hernias are indirect inguinal hernias in the setting of incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis.
Incarcerated hernias are not reducible. Edema within the herniated bowel wall can lead to strangulation within 24 h. Necrosis and potential perforation ensue if engorgement of venous and lymphatic structures impedes arterial flow to the tissue. 
The incidence of inguinal hernias is as high as 4.4%, with premature infants at the highest risk due to incomplete development. 
Most commonly seen in the first year of life and 10 times more common in boys than in girls. 
PEARLS
In females, up to 20% of hernias may contain ovaries or fallopian tubes; very rarely, herniation of the uterus may occur. 
Pediatric inguinal hernias typically require repair.
Diagnosis
Children may present with groin and abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Infants may present with only fussiness.
Inspect for masses or bulging in the lower abdomen and groin area. Always perform a testicular exam because extension into the scrotum is common. The scrotum may have a dark bluish hue as a result of venous congestion. Infarcted tissue will provoke severe pain on gentle palpation.
Exam tip for non-incarcerated hernias: Increase intra-abdominal pressure to induce bulging of a hernia. This can be done by eliciting a cough. For infants, gently holding down their arms and legs against the examination table will provoke them to cry and may allow a hernia to present. 
Among inguinal hernias, 60% present on the right side. 
Diagnostic test of choice: ultrasound
Abdominal radiographs should be performed for any patient in whom perforation is suspected.
Treatment
A symptomatic hernia is an indication for surgical repair. Incarcerated hernias require emergency repair to prevent complications.
Manual reduction should be attempted with an incarcerated hernia. Strangulation is a contraindication to manual reduction and presents with peritonitis, bloody stool, erythema, or necrosis of the overlying skin or bilious emesis.
Place the child in the Trendelenburg position and use gentle pressure against the mass. Application of an ice pack to the hernia for 10-15 minutes before a reduction attempt can be helpful (sometimes curative). Keep the child as calm as possible and provide adequate analgesia (acetaminophen 10-15 mg/kg, morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV, or fentanyl 1 μg/kg IV or IM).
Successful reductions should be followed by outpatient surgical consultation because the risk for reincarceration is high. After reduction, monitor briefly in the ED, watching for signs of perforation that may manifest as peritoneal signs or persistent vomiting following reduction.
Unsuccessful reductions require immediate surgical consultation. Unreduced incarcerated and strangulated hernias require emergent surgical intervention.
Disposition
Home
Patients with easily reduced hernias can be discharged home after discussion or outpatient plan with surgical colleagues. The patient will need close observation at home, good anticipatory guidance, and a solid follow-up plan.
Admission
Admit children in whom reduction was difficult or unsuccessful or when strangulation is a possibility. Also admit those in whom monitoring or follow-up is unreliable.
Operating Room/Surgery
Definitive treatment is indirect inguinal herniorrhaphy.",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
Ages: 3 mo to 3 y old,Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
"Rapid Access—Intussusception
Approach to the Critical Patient
Treat as a surgical diagnosis with early surgical consultation, although most cases are amenable to non-operative (enema) management.
Patients <3 y old are often responsive to non-operative reduction with an enema.
Patients >3 y old more commonly require operative intervention.
Obtain IV access and correct for fluid losses.
Place a nasogastric tube for vomiting and distension.
Provide pain control such as morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV.
If signs of perforation are present, obtain cultures and administer antibiotics as described in The Undifferentiated Pediatric Patient with an Abdominal Complaint.
Key Concepts
Intussusception is a telescoping of the bowel wall into itself. Among such cases, 80% involve invagination of the ileum into the cecum at the ileocolic valve and are termed “ileocolic;”  however, this may occur at other locations along the small and large bowel.
Of these cases, 90% are idiopathic but may be associated with inflamed Peyer’s patches in the setting of recent illness; 10% have an identifiable lead point such as Meckel’s diverticulum.
Small bowel intussusception can occur and has a non-specific presentation. Short segments usually spontaneously reduce.
Delay in diagnosis is associated with necrosis, perforation, obstruction, and a decrease in the success rate of therapeutic enema, increasing the likelihood of the need for surgical repair and potential bowel resection.
Diagnosis
PITFALLS
The classic triad (abdominal colic, vomiting, and currant jelly stools) is only seen in one-third of patients.
Abdominal pain is severe, colicky, and episodic, with symptom-free periods.
Lethargy can also be a presenting symptom and may complicate the clinical picture.
Pertinent historical information: Recent viral or diarrheal illness, description of pain, and changes in stooling, including the presence of bloody stool.
Vomiting may be present, as this is an obstructive process.
Note that 20% of patients are symptom-free at presentation.
Physical exam may show a child writhing in pain or unable to get comfortable.
Abdominal distension is more commonly seen with more-distal obstructions.
A sausage-shaped mass may be palpable in the right upper abdomen.
An empty right lower quadrant may be present on exam or X-ray.
PITFALLS
A rigid abdomen with involuntary guarding should prompt immediate surgical consultation and is a contraindication to diagnostic or therapeutic enema.
Diagnostic test of choice: ultrasound, sensitivity of 98-100%;  may show the classic “doughnut sign.” Image Image
Obtain abdominal radiographs for any pediatric patient in whom obstruction or perforation is suspected. This should include supine, upright/cross-table lateral views. Look for dilated bowel loops and air-fluid levels that may signify obstruction.
“Target sign” appears as a round mass of soft tissue with concentric lucency.
Consider performing a hemoccult test if stool is available or from digital rectal exam.
Laboratory studies: CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, and type and screen.
Treatment
Emergency surgical consultation in patients with signs of perforation, shock, or peritonitis.
Non-surgical reduction by a trained radiologist with air or contrast enema for other patients. Success rates >90%. 
It is recommended that the surgical team be involved early in case of perforation, failed reduction, or need for observation.
Disposition
Home
A short period of observation in the ED may be appropriate for patients who have had successful enema-reduced intussusception and are otherwise well. 
Complications following reduction are rare, and recurrence, while recurrence occurs in 8-15% of patients, repeat intussusception in the day following reduction is uncommon (2.2-3.9).  Rates of recurrence and complications do not differ between children who were discharged or hospitalized.  Thus, admission in this group should be based on other medical or social needs rather than observation for recurrence or complications. Practice patterns vary widely based on region, guardian resources, and the ability for a prompt return for care.
Admission
Admit all patients who have a difficult or failed enema reduction or in whom surgical reduction is anticipated.
Admit patients with significant dehydration.
Operating Room/Surgery
Surgical reduction is reserved for patients with signs of perforation, shock, or peritonitis or for those who have failed enema reduction. ",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
Ages: 3 y old through adolescence,Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
"Rapid Access—Pediatric Appendicitis
Approach to the Critical Patient
If there are signs of perforation or sepsis, obtain cultures and administer antibiotics as described in The Undifferentiated Pediatric Patient with an Abdominal Complaint.
Consult pediatric general surgery immediately for any ill-appearing child with peritoneal signs.
Provide pain control (eg, morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV), IV rehydration (isotonic crystalloid fluids 20 mL/kg, repeat as needed), and electrolyte repletion as indicated.
Key Concepts
The appendix is a blind pouch off the cecum that is prone to obstruction by fecaliths or primary inflammation, resulting in painful edema and potential necrosis with perforation.
Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children.
Younger children are more likely to perforate due to thinner appendiceal walls and a less developed omentum. Difficulty in communicating symptoms and delayed diagnosis also contribute to perforation at younger ages.
High rates of initial misdiagnosis have been reported in children under 12 y old (28-57%), as high as 100% in children under 2 y old. 
Bimodal disease course with initial right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain followed by improvement and then fever and ill appearance suggests perforation.
Many children in whom appendicitis is ruled out have mesenteric adenitis or ascending colonic constipation.
Diagnosis
Classically presents as vague periumbilical abdominal pain that migrates to the RLQ and may be associated with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever.
Physical exam: If the peritoneum is irritated, the child will be lying still. Movement of the bed or heel tapping may provoke pain.
Pain with palpation over McBurney’s point with rebound tenderness
Rovsing, psoas, and obturator signs are often unreliable in children but should be assessed.
Always check the diaper/groin area to rule out other conditions such as inguinal hernia and testicular torsion.
Diagnostic test of choice: ultrasound, looking for an enlarged, non-compressible blind ending pouch at the point of maximal tenderness in the RLQ. Fecaliths may be visualized. Obesity and gas may limit exam.
Primary criterion: Maximal outer diameter >6 mm
Secondary criteria: Appendiceal wall thickness (>3 mm), wall hyperemia on doppler, mesenteric fat stranding, presence of appendicolith, or free fluid.
If ultrasound is equivocal, consider serial exams or CT/MRI.
Ultrasound and CT have similar specificities; CT scan is more sensitive, but ultrasound sensitivity improves with time from onset of symptoms.
PITFALLS
A non-diagnostic ultrasound (ie, approximately 50%) does not rule out appendicitis. High suspicion should be followed by surgical consultation, CT, or MRI. In cases with a low clinical probability, have a clear follow-up plan with return precautions or consider observation/admission for serial exams if social factors may preclude appropriate care.
Laboratory studies: CBC may reveal leukocytosis or a left shift, CRP may be elevated, and UA may show sterile pyuria.
CRP >3 mg/dL and procalcitonin >0.18 ng/mL on admission are associated with higher rates of complications. 
The provider’s clinical experience and acumen are at least as good as any clinical decision rule that currently exists for pediatric appendicitis.
Treatment
NPO
IV fluids
Consult pediatric general surgery for management, which may include surgical removal or medical management with antibiotics and observation.
Judicious pain control will not interfere with the reliability of the exam and is encouraged.
Antibiotics as described in The Undifferentiated Pediatric Patient with an Abdominal Complaint.
Disposition
Home
Discharge with specific return precautions may be considered for patients with strong social support in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis is less likely and imaging and laboratory studies are non-diagnostic. Follow-up should be within 12-24 h with clear return parameters.
Serial examinations in the ED may also be considered if departmental volume allows.
Admission
Admission for serial exams may be considered for patients in whom early appendicitis is suspected and imaging is non-diagnostic.
In the interim, other findings such as constipation may be treated to help clarify the picture.
Operating Room/Surgery
Admission for appendectomy for any child in whom appendicitis is strongly suspected or with imaging confirmation of appendicitis.
Laparoscopic repair is preferred for straightforward cases.
The surgeon may discuss non-surgical options with the family.
Growing literature supports the use of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone for uncomplicated appendicitis. This approach has demonstrated a safety profile and efficacy similar to those of operative intervention.  Families must be willing and able to return with worsening pain, fever, or vomiting. Although this approach is more widely adopted in European countries, in the U.S., this decision should be made in consultation with a surgeon.",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
"Rapid Access—Henoch-Schönlein Purpura
Approach to the Critical Patient
Fever and ill appearance with petechial or purpuric rash should prompt work-up and immediate treatment for meningococcemia. This is not necessary for patients who fit the clinical picture of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP).
Treat severe pain and dehydration.
Key Concepts
HSP is a hypersensitivity vasculitis of arterioles and capillaries. Immunoglobulin deposition leads to a petechial and the classic purpuric rash. Photo
Commonly evaluated as undifferentiated abdominal pain until rash appears.
Most commonly affects children ages 4-11 y.
Typically follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection.
Intussusception is a rare but potential complication, seen in 2-6% of cases. 
HSP is a self-limited condition, resolving within 6-8 wk. 
Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis based on history of intermittent abdominal pain, with or without arthralgias, and rash. Laboratory studies may assist in diagnosis.
Rash is classically non-blanchable petechiae and purpura on the lower extremities and buttocks. Occasionally, the upper extremities are also involved but to a lesser degree.
Obtain UA. Microscopic hematuria, white blood cells, casts, or protein suggest renal involvement and may be used to help rule in this disease. Renal involvement occurs in approximately one-third of cases, with only 2% resulting in end-stage renal failure.  Laboratory findings of nephritis should prompt close outpatient follow-up for progression or resolution.
Consider stool hemoccult.
Petechiae may prompt CBC; however, these patients will have a normal platelet count.
Treatment
Supportive care with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen. Avoid NSAIDs in cases of renal or gastrointestinal involvement.
Corticosteroids remain controversial but may play a role in symptomatic management, specifically in treating abdominal pain, arthralgia, and purpura. Discretion should be used in determining which patients may benefit.
Prednisone: 1 mg/kg/d (max: 60 mg) for 1-2 wk with an appropriate wean
Refer patients with renal involvement to a nephrologist.
Consider rheumatology consultation if available.
Disposition
Home
Most children with a diagnosis can be discharged home with primary care physician follow-up.
Admission
Admission is typically reserved for children in whom a diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is uncertain and further diagnostic testing is required.
Admission may also be considered for severe, intractable pain.",Pediatric Abdominal Disorders
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Identify poor perfusion and other signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF).
If the patient is dehydrated and volume-depleted (eg, poor feeding, sweating from fever, or increased work of breathing/feeding), use fluids cautiously, if at all. If a bolus is needed, start with 5-10 mL/kg normal saline and monitor patient’s hemodynamic response. 
Use echocardiography early to aid in diagnosis and to assess response to treatment.
Consult pediatric cardiology early in the patient’s course to help guide care.
Start prostaglandin (PGE-1) early if ductal-dependent congenital heart disease (CHD) is suspected in neonatal patients (<3 wk of life). 
Consider the use of inotropic agents (dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine) based on response to initial therapies.
Milrinone is frequently used in pediatric ICUs as first-line therapy to increase inotropy and decrease afterload but should be used cautiously in the ED setting because it has a long half-life and is slow to both act and wear off. Because of the decreased afterload, milrinone may actually decrease blood pressure (BP) initially; thus, it is often used in conjunction with other agents. 
Treat arrhythmias per Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines. 
Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if patient is refractory to maximal medical management or surgical correction if underlying CHD is the cause. 
Board Review Ductal Dependant Lesions Causing Shock EM:RAP Audio, and Causing Cyanosis EM:RAP Audio
Key Concepts
The most common cause of pediatric CHF is CHD. 
Causes of pediatric heart failure and heart failure exacerbations are varied, but their pathophysiologic effects can be categorized as:
Reduced ventricular contractility
Fluid overload/increased preload
Increased systemic vascular resistance/afterload 
Consider in the patient who is afebrile with unexplained tachycardia.
Consider CHF in the child with signs and symptoms of
Unexplained tachypnea/tachycardia with abnormal lung sounds
Failure to thrive and poor growth
Feeding and exercise intolerance
Hepatomegaly
Poor perfusion and respiratory distress
Echocardiography is the diagnostic test of choice and should be obtained early when CHF is suspected.
A combination of CXR for cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema as well as ECG, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin, CBC, CMP, lactate, and venous blood gas (VBG) are also useful for diagnosis. 
Goals of treatment are to improve systemic tissue perfusion by increasing inotropy, decreasing afterload, controlling arrhythmias, and correcting the underlying cause.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation (varies depending on the age of the child and cause): A 6-mo-old with recent prolonged viral upper respiratory infection presents with tachypnea, hypoxia, and tachycardia despite being afebrile. Has had extreme difficulty feeding and been less active for the past 3 d.
History
Varies based on age 
Neonate: Poor feeding and weight gain, fussiness, decreased urine output, increasing fatigue.
Older child: Dyspnea on exertion, dizziness and syncope, weakness, chronic cough.

Vital signs: Increased heart rate and respiratory rate with decreased BP and oxygen saturation (in decompensated CHF).
S3 gallop or new murmur
Wheezing, occasionally rales
Grunting respirations
Hepatomegaly, ascites
Cool, poorly perfused extremities
Cool extremities with poor capillary refill
Jugular venous distention (JVD) and pedal edema (rare in younger children)
Tests
Point-of-care U/S (POCUS) is the fastest way to assess overall function and assess for effusion. 
Formal ECG should be obtained.
CXR: Cardiomegaly found in 98% of patients in one ED study,  pulmonary edema, pleural effusions.
ECG: Most commonly sinus tachycardia; assess for arrhythmias [supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common] and ischemia.
Labs: BNP, troponin, CMP, CBC, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), lactate, VBG, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Treatment
If patient is in shock, resuscitate according to PALS guidelines. 
If signs of heart failure are already present, administer fluids with caution.
If patient volume is depleted, use small 5-10 mL/kg normal saline fluid boluses.
Reassess during resuscitation for worsening clinical condition from fluid administration.
May require epinephrine or dopamine as initial inotropic support.
May require additional inotropic therapy with milrinone if BP will tolerate the resulting afterload reduction; often performed in conjunction with intensivist or pediatric cardiologist.
Correct acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities.
May require sedation and intubation, especially if patient is agitated or has severe respiratory distress, to decrease systemic oxygen utilization and improve oxygenation.
Highly important to optimize hemodynamics before intubation to avoid peri-intubation arrest.
If patient is stable and fluid-overloaded, attempt diuresis with furosemide, 1 mg/kg IV q6-12h.
If SVT/arrhythmia is present 
Evidence of cardiopulmonary compromise: Hypotension, altered mental status, or signs of shock.
Synchronized cardioversion: 0.5-1 J/kg first dose; 2 J/kg second dose
If patient is stable
Vagal maneuvers; for example, ice to upper face for 15 s (avoid carotid massage, ocular pressure).
First line: Adenosine 0.1 mg/kg (up to 6 mg), second dose 0.2 mg/kg (up to 12 mg).
Rapid IV injection at site closest to central circulation; flush immediately
IO injection is acceptable
Second line: Procainamide 10-15 mg/kg bolus; infusion of 20 μg/kg/min or amiodarone 5 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) over 20-60 min. 
If patient is stable with wide-complex tachycardia
First line: Lidocaine (preferred over procainamide and amiodarone; more evidence in children) as 1 mg/kg IV bolus, infusion of 20-50 μg/kg/min.
Second line: Amiodarone 5 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) over 20-60 min
Disposition
Any new diagnosis of CHF should be admitted to a pediatric tertiary care facility. 
Moderate to severe CHF with any hemodynamic or pulmonary compromise should be admitted to a pediatric ICU.
Disposition for stable compensated CHF should be made in consultation with pediatric cardiology.",Pediatric Cardiac Disorders

Background
Epidemiology
Pediatric heart failure affects 12,000-35,000 patients per year in the U.S. 
60% of cases are related to CHD.
80% of cases occur in infants.
Approximately 14,000 pediatric patients per year have CHF-related hospitalizations.
Pathophysiology
Cardiac output is the stroke volume times the heart rate.
The stroke volume is determined by 3 factors:
Preload (the filling volume)
Afterload (the pressure required to eject blood from the left ventricle)
Contractility
Poor systemic perfusion results in fluid retention via the renin-angiotensin system.
The release of angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, increasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and initially increasing BP.
This initially leads to improved preload but subsequently leads to increased myocardial oxygen use, ventricular wall stress, and eventual dilation and decreased contractility and cardiac output.
Increased SVR increases the afterload, which eventually causes increased cardiac stress as well.
Increased sympathetic stimulation leads to increased heart rate and initially increased oxygen delivery. However, as tachycardia worsens, diastolic filling decreases and cardiac output falls because of the decrease in contractility based on the Frank-Starling law. 
The causes of pediatric heart failure are many: 
CHD with concurrent ventricular dysfunction
Myocarditis
Myocardial infarction (MI)/ischemia from
Kawasaki disease: Consider in patients with a history of prolonged fever and associated rash, conjunctivitis, adenopathy, mucosal changes (cracked lips and “strawberry tongue”), swelling of extremities, and desquamation of hands and feet (late finding). Can lead to coronary artery aneurysms and thrombosis, causing MI.
Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) (or occasionally from another aberrant location).
Familial hypercholesterolemia.
Illicit drug use.
Arrhythmogenic
SVT
Ventricular tachycardia
Complete heart block with bradycardia (eg, congenital lupus)
Drug/toxin exposure
Beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose
Chemotherapeutic agents
Cardiomyopathy
Dilated or restrictive
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; rarely causes heart failure
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-related cardiomyopathy; assess for epsilon wave on ECG
Non-cardiac causes
Severe anemia
Thyrotoxicosis
Arteriovenous malformation
Sepsis
Pulmonary disorders: Cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension
Nutritional deficiencies
Metabolic disorders/storage diseases
Acute heart failure can be classified into 4 presentations: 
Warm and dry: Normal filling pressures with good perfusion
Warm and wet: Elevated filling pressures with fluid overload and pulmonary edema, but perfusion is maintained
Cold and wet: Elevated filling pressures and poor perfusion
Cold and dry: Normal filling pressures with poor perfusion
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
A thorough history and physical exam along with a high index of suspicion are critical in arriving at a diagnosis of CHF in the pediatric population.
Heart failure is often misdiagnosed on the first presentation because the often-associated tachypnea and abnormal lung sounds cause the clinician to believe that the patient has asthma, pneumonia, or bronchiolitis. 
The presentation varies extensively based on age and etiology. 
In the younger child, focus questioning on feeding and basic daily activities:
Tachypnea or sweating with feeds
Gagging or taking much longer to finish feeds
Poor weight gain or weight loss
Decrease in urine output
Decrease in energy, sleeping much more than normal
In the older child, ask questions related to exercise tolerance and general energy levels:
Unable to tolerate normal (for the patient) sports/activities
Dizziness or recent syncopal episodes
Unexpected weight gain or loss
Orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
Tachycardia is the most common vital sign abnormality associated with heart failure.
Dehydration, fever, pain, and, in the pediatric population, fear are all very common contributors to tachycardia.
The tachycardia in heart failure is often very persistent, despite fever and pain control, and will often worsen with the administration of fluids.
The physical exam findings can be classified by their cause: 
Pulmonary venous congestion (caused by left-to-right shunt, pulmonary edema)
Tachypnea
Wheezing
Grunting, nasal flaring, and retractions with breathing
Cough
Systemic venous congestion (increased right-sided pressures/right heart failure)
Pleural effusion
Hepatomegaly
Ascites
Peripheral edema: Less common in children; in infants, assess for eyelid and sacral edema
Weight gain and JVD: Much less common in children
Decreased cardiac output
Delayed capillary refill, mottling, and cool extremities with weak pulses
Pallor
Fatigue, dizziness, and syncope
Confusion
Failure to thrive
Radiographic and ECG Findings
CXR is the most widely used and readily available screening tool for heart failure in pediatrics.
Cardiomegaly is nearly always present due to ventricular dilation. 
Assess for cardiomegaly by measuring the cardiothoracic ratio:
Cardiomegaly is present if the ratio is greater than 0.55 in infants and 0.5 in older children on a film with good inspiration.
Interpretation may be slightly difficult in a young infant due to the thymic silhouette.
Pulmonary edema and increased vascular markings are frequently seen, along with pleural effusions, in right-sided heart failure.
Echocardiography (echo) is the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of heart failure.
Echo is not only useful in assessing for anatomical abnormalities and CHD, it is the best tool for assessing overall cardiac output and ejection fraction and for assessing pericardial effusion. 
Although POCUS is provider- and experience-dependent, many emergency clinicians are gaining increasing comfort with POCUS to assess for overall global function and pericardial effusion.
Even if POCUS is used as a screening tool, if CHF is suspected, a formal U/S performed by a pediatric echocardiographer should be obtained. If not available at the facility, transfer to a tertiary care center with pediatric cardiology is recommended.
ECG should be obtained on all patients with suspected or known heart failure.
The most common ECG finding will be sinus tachycardia; however, arrhythmia or ischemic patterns may be present.
Increased amplitude of QRS complexes across the precordial leads may indicate ventricular wall hypertrophy, although normal values for amplitude vary based on age.
Decreased amplitude of QRS complexes may indicate myocarditis or a pericardial effusion.
Electrical alternans, demonstrated by beat-to-beat alternation in the QRS amplitudes, may be present in a large pericardial effusion.
Myocarditis may also show ST segment changes that mimic cardiac ischemia.
ALCAPA may show an anterolateral ischemic pattern.
Laboratory Findings
BNP is one of the most helpful laboratory values for children in whom heart failure is considered in the differential diagnosis.
BNP is released from myocardium following ventricular wall stress and can be used to help distinguish heart failure from respiratory disease.
Abnormal BNP levels vary with age: 
First week of life: >170 pg/mL is abnormal (sensitivity 94%; specificity 73%)
Older infants and children up to 19 y: >41 pg/mL is abnormal (sensitivity 87%; specificity 70%)
BNP >300 pg/mL is associated with poor outcome.
Troponin to assess for cardiac ischemia (may be elevated in MI, myocarditis, or ALCAPA).
One study of pediatric patients with myocarditis found that all true myocarditis patients had a troponin-T value >0.01 ng/mL. 
Any elevation of troponin in a pediatric patient should be concerning.
VBG: Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis is often caused by pulmonary edema and poor tissue perfusion.
CBC to assess for a correctable anemia that could be contributing to high-output cardiac failure.
Electrolytes should be checked because hyponatremia could be present due to free water retention. Infants are highly dependent on circulating calcium levels for optimal cardiac contractility and function.
Lactate will be elevated with poor tissue perfusion and is a marker that can be followed during the resuscitation of a critically ill heart failure patient. Note that if asthma was considered in the differential diagnosis, albuterol may have been used, which can elevate lactate as well.
Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine may be elevated as a result of poor renal perfusion. This could lead to hyperkalemia due to renal compromise.
If considering an infectious or inflammatory cause of heart failure such as myocarditis or endocarditis, inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR should be obtained. 
Therapeutic Considerations
The treatment of acute CHF is complex and based not only on the cause of the heart failure but also on the clinical presentation of the patient, fitting into the 4 presentation descriptions discussed earlier. 
Warm and dry: Normal filling pressures with adequate perfusion.
Main goal of therapy is prevention of disease progression (in conjunction with the cardiologist).
Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as recommended by cardiology for long-term care.
Warm and wet: Elevated filling pressures with fluid overload and pulmonary edema, but perfusion is maintained (BP and O2 are stable).
Main goal of therapy is diuresis.
Furosemide 1 mg/kg IV, q6-12h PRN response.
Afterload reduction with ACE inhibitors in conjunction with pediatric cardiology.
Cold and wet: Elevated filling pressures and poor perfusion.
If patient is hypotensive, initiate inotropic therapy with dopamine, epinephrine, or dobutamine.
If patient is normotensive, cardiology may wish to start milrinone for afterload reduction and increased perfusion. Use caution, however, as milrinone has a long half-life and may decrease BP initially. A second inotropic agent is often needed, along with milrinone.
Attempt diuresis only once BP has stabilized and perfusion is improved.
Cold and dry: Normal filling pressures with poor perfusion.
Inotropes (dopamine and epinephrine).
Vasodilation and afterload reduction with milrinone only if BP is stable.
If patient is refractory to mechanical ventilation and inotropic support, ECMO may be required as a bridge to a ventricular assist device and/or transplant.
In the critically ill pediatric heart failure patient, consider early transport to a tertiary care facility with pediatric cardiology, pediatric critical care, and ECMO/cardiothoracic surgery capabilities. 
Correct acidosis and any electrolyte abnormalities.
Pediatric patients are highly dependent on adequate calcium levels for inotropy.
Calcium gluconate 50-100 mg/kg IV.
Calcium chloride 10-20 mg/kg IV (only in cases of central access or patient in full arrest).
May require sedation and intubation, especially if patient is agitated or has severe respiratory distress, to decrease systemic oxygen utilization and improve oxygenation.
Very important to optimize hemodynamics before intubation to avoid peri-intubation arrest.
Recommend having inotropic agents running before intubation or at least bedside and ready to start if needed.
Use hemodynamically protective rapid sequence intubation medications.
Do not use agents that may decrease BP.
Use a smaller dose of sedative than normal, especially if the patient is altered or profoundly hypotensive.
Etomidate and ketamine are the most hemodynamically protective sedation agents.
Inotropic agent choices
Dopamine 2-20 μg/kg/min
Increases contractility and perfusion
Also increases myocardial O2 demand, especially at higher doses, and can cause significant tachycardia and arrhythmias.
Epinephrine 0.1-1 μg/kg/min
At the lower end of the dosing range, it has a greater effect on increasing contractility than on BP.
At the higher end of the dosing range, it results in a greater increase in peripheral vascular resistance and afterload increase.
Dobutamine 2-20 μg/kg/min
Significant increase in inotropy/contractility
Significant afterload reduction due to peripheral vasodilation and may have an initial decrease in BP.
Much shorter half-life than milrinone, possibly making it safer in the short term if afterload reduction is needed but BP is tenuous.
Milrinone 50 μg/kg IV load over 60 min followed by 0.25-1 μg/kg/min infusion
Significant increase in contractility
Potent afterload reduction agent due to vasodilation and decreased SVR
Slow onset and offset due to long half-life, potentially making it a less-safe first-line ED medication, especially in the unstable cardiogenic shock patient.
If SVT is the cause of the CHF and cardiomyopathy, therapeutic considerations are as follows.
In the prehospital setting, the upside-down position for Valsalva was shown to be more effective than other techniques in a small cohort study. 
There is considerable disagreement over the optimum Valsalva maneuver for termination of SVT, which has been primarily studied in adults; however traditional methods that include the use of blowing against a fixed obstruction (blocked straw, syringe) have been shown to be effective. 
First-dose success of adenosine use has been estimated at approximately 50%; however, refractory SVT is more common in infants and older children. 
Adenosine administration can be difficult, and there have been case reports of failure of successful conversion via IO administration of adenosine. 
Traditional use of the stopcock setup for adenosine administration in an in vitro model of delivery showed that in patients <10 kg, administration through the stopcock delivered lower doses than expected. 
Procainamide slows conduction through the myocardium via inhibition of sodium-dependent depolarization. It is also safe to administer in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
Procainamide dosing for neonates: Loading dose 7-10 mg/kg over 60 min
Infants and older children: Loading dose of 10-15 mg/kg over 30-60 min
Followed by continuous infusion of procainamide at 20 μg/kg/min
Amiodarone prolongs the refractory period of the atrioventricular (AV) node.
Loading bolus infusion 5 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) over 20-60 min;  can repeat up to a total of 15 mg/kg. Note that in hemodynamically stable patients, the loading dose is usually administered over 60 min.
Continuous infusion of 5-15 μg/kg/min.
Consider beta blockade with esmolol in hemodynamically stable patients who do not respond to initial adenosine doses.
Loading 100-500 μg/kg over 1 min, followed by 25-100 μg/kg/min infusion
Calcium channel blockers are not recommended for children under 2 y of age.",Pediatric Cardiac Disorders
"Rapid Access—Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)
Approach to the Critical Patient
Evaluation for congenital heart disease (CHD): Perform a thorough physical exam for murmurs and hepatomegaly, pre-ductal (right upper extremity [RUE]) and post-ductal (either lower extremity) pulse oximetry, and 4 extremity blood pressure (BP) measurements.
Perform hyperoxia test: 100% O2 supplied at bedside for 10-15 min.
If there is no or minimal response to supplemental O2, consider cyanotic heart disease.
If there is a response (improvement in O2 saturation ≥10%), consider pulmonary cause.
Listen for pathologic murmurs: Harsh, intensity grade 3+, pansystolic timing, abnormal S2.
Assess for systolic BP difference of >20 mm Hg between RUE and legs; consider aortic coarctation.
Consider prostaglandin E1 (PGE1): 0.1 μg/kg/min IV initially; once patient is stabilized, maintenance dose of 0.01-0.05 μg/kg/min.
If initiating PGE1, monitor for side effects, including apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension; be ready to intubate.
Beware of the risk of cardiac arrest during endotracheal intubation.
Cyanotic patients with ductal-dependent systemic blood flow might decompensate with oxygen; oxygen results in pulmonary vasodilation. The patient may have pulmonary vascular overcirculation or systemic “steal.” Do not withhold oxygen, but consider discontinuation if patient status worsens.
Key Concepts
When evaluating a patient in whom CHD is a concern, remember the basic physiology of the transition from fetal circulation to postnatal circulation; in short, closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA) typically marks the onset of symptoms and reversal of closure can be life-saving.
PGE1 infusion may be life-saving even if the specific diagnosis is unknown.
Ductal-dependent lesions can present in the first few days to 3 wk of age.
Ductal-dependent cyanotic lesions (known as the 5 Ts)
Truncus arteriosus
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
Tricuspid anomalies (atresia or Epstein’s anomaly)
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return
Also consider hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary stenosis, and pulmonary atresia
Ductal-dependent lesions causing shock: Coarctation of the aorta, critical aortic stenosis, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, TGA, hypoplastic right heart syndrome.
Persistent tachypnea may be the only sign of CHD.
Maintain a high index of suspicion for ductal-dependent cardiac lesion for any newborn with central cyanosis, acute decompensation, severe hypoxemia, tachypnea, acidosis, or shock.
Acyanotic lesions that result in pulmonary overcirculation often present later as the pulmonary pressures drop and are covered in the heart failure section: Ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrioventricular (AV) canal defects.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation: Ductal-dependent CHD lesions
Three-day-old male presenting with increased sleepiness, fatigue, and poor feeding, decreased urine output, and increasing tachypnea over the last 24 h.
ED nightmare presentation: Four-hour-old ex-full term female presenting with tachypnea, lethargy, and cyanosis after home birth. Patient with limited prenatal care.
History
Fetal diagnosis
Episodes of cyanosis
Sweating with feeds and difficulty feeding
Fussiness and/or increasing fatigue
Decreasing urine output
Physical
Vital signs: Increased respiratory rate, tachycardia
BP in all 4 limbs: Increased concern for CHD if systolic BP in upper extremities
≥20 mm Hg greater than in lower extremities
Assess for murmur, crackles in lungs, and hepatomegaly
Brachial and femoral pulse comparison
Pulse oximetry; assess character of peripheral pulse
Skin: Assess capillary refill, central cyanosis, sweating
Tests
CXR
ECG
Consider bedside echocardiography
Consider blood gas with lactate, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin
Blood culture
Treatment
If patient is in shock, resuscitate according to pediatric advanced life support (PALS).
Initiate prostaglandins in patients less than 3 wk old while evaluating.
Judicious fluid use of 10 mL/kg normal saline with close re-evaluation (risk of worsening heart failure).
Inotropic support: Consider epinephrine in cases of hypotension and bradycardia.
Correction of acidosis for pH <7.0 or per recommendation by pediatric cardiology.
If available, consider respiratory support with high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula or nasal continuous positive airway pressure.
If patient remains severely hypoxemic and tachypneic or develops apnea despite PGE and supplemental O2, intubation may be required.
When deciding to intubate, consider whether increased intrathoracic pressure will be detrimental to the patient’s preload. This is especially important in single ventricle physiology, inter-stage CHD (not fully palliated). Because these patients tolerate cyanosis well, it is hard to develop clear guidelines, and a risk-benefit analysis between the degree of cyanosis and respiratory distress versus the potential loss of preload must be considered on an individual basis.
Consider antibiotics, given that sepsis is the leading cause of shock in infants.
Disposition
Home
Infants with ductal-dependent lesions will not be discharged home.
In the case of ASD and VSD patients with no hemodynamic instability, good weight gain, no respiratory distress, appropriate follow-up established with pediatric cardiology, observed feeding with no hypoxia noted, and no evidence of weight loss on growth chart (appropriate weight gain: ~15-30 g/d in early infancy), discharge home is an option.
Patients with incidental murmurs who meet the above criteria can also be discharged home.
Admission
New diagnosis of undifferentiated congenital heart lesions and ductal-dependent lesions on PGE1 infusions require neonatal ICU versus pediatric ICU with cardiology capacity.
Staged repair for palliated children with a single ventricle state, hypoplastic left or right heart syndrome.
Inter-stage CHD (not fully palliated) is at extremely high risk for rapid decompensation, mainly because the pulmonary blood flow is passive.
Simple febrile illnesses or mild dehydration can compromise pulmonary blood flow and deepen cyanosis.
These patients may need admission if condition (fever, dehydration risk) is not resolved.
Patients with known CHD after palliative surgery have a high risk for sudden cardiac death, which increases with:
Increasing age of the patient
Complexity of the repair
Poor ventricular function
History of arrhythmias
High-risk surgeries: Fontan procedure, TOF, aortic stenosis, TGA, coarctation of the aorta
Admit for overnight monitoring, repeat formal echocardiography to assess function.
When in doubt, attempt to consult child’s primary cardiologist or the local pediatric cardiologist who would be the admitting physician for the patient.
Operating Room/Surgery
If patient is critically ill despite PGE infusion and maximal respiratory and hemodynamic support, CHD patients are good extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) candidates if identified early and at a facility with pediatric ECMO capability.
Once critical CHD is identified, most patients will require surgical intervention.",Pediatric Cardiac Disorders
"Deep Dive—Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)
Background
Epidemiology
CHD is the most common type of birth defect, occurring in 1% of live births per year, corresponding to approximately 40,000 patients. 
The most common congenital heart defect is a VSD.
The most common cyanotic heart defect is tetralogy of Fallot.
Leading cause of birth-associated illness and death in infants. 
Of these cases, 29% are associated with major non-cardiac malformations.
Screening with pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturation testing before hospital discharge can detect up to 82.8% of all cardiac defects. 
Risk factors include maternal diabetes mellitus, family history of CHD, and exposure to indomethacin, lithium, alcohol, and phenytoin.
Pathophysiology
Presentation at time of transition from fetal to postnatal circulation.
Reminder
Prenatal circulation
Ductal-dependent lesions that require PDA for pulmonary blood flow will present with severe cyanosis. This will start developing as the DA is closing.
Ductal-dependent lesions that require a PDA for systemic blood flow will evolve into cardiogenic shock. The left ventricular outflow tract depends on blood flow from the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta through the DA.
Shunt lesions with right-to-left flow present with cyanosis because of the passage of deoxygenated blood to the systemic circulation. These patients will often present with normal feeding and weight gain despite cyanosis.
Shunt lesions such as a VSD with left-to-right flow will present with pulmonary overcirculation, tachypnea, tachycardia, poor feeding, and weight loss. Often the presentation of left-to-right shunts occurs later, in the 2- to 6-wk age range (depending on the size of the VSD), and is due to the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Clinical presentations of CHD are widely variable and can include:
Fetal diagnosis
Murmur
Cyanosis
Subacute heart failure: Feeding intolerance, tachypnea, sweating
Acute heart failure: Cardiogenic shock, oliguria, pulmonary edema, gallop, hepatomegaly
Coarctation of the aorta is difficult to identify on fetal echocardiogram and is the most commonly missed type of CHD along with VSD and ASD. 
Evaluating patients for murmurs can be a good first step for evaluation of CHD; however, there is considerable variability in the ability of highly trained physicians to diagnose pathologic murmurs. Cardiologists were reported to identify pathological murmurs with approximately 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity, exhibiting superior performance compared with neonatologists (78% sensitivity, 33% specificity). 
Pulse oximetry, which is now performed during routine newborn screening before hospital discharge, can diagnose CHD before the onset of symptoms in some cases. 
The physiologic basis for hyperoxia test is as follows. If CHD is associated with intracardiac right-to-left shunting resulting in cyanosis, then the blood in the pulmonary veins is fully saturated with oxygen, and more inspired oxygen will not affect the deoxygenated blood shunted to the systemic circulation. The gold standard uses arterial pO2, but pulse oximetry is often used as a proxy. However, the use of oxygen therapy must be judicious because 100% O2 is a potent pulmonary vasodilator, and with a ductal-dependent lesion, it will decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, increase pulmonary blood flow, and worsen pulmonary overcirculation.
Children with CHD are high utilizers of the ED, with significant morbidity and mortality. Presentations to the ED often occur in the first year of age. With improvement in care, there has been an overall decline in mortality, which potentially means increased numbers of these patients. 
Radiographic Evaluation
In experienced hands, the use of point-of-care U/S (POCUS) in the ED may help with the diagnosis of CHD, but this is highly operator-dependent.
If clinical suspicion for CHD is high, treatment should not be delayed or based on bedside U/S.
Definitive diagnosis requires a technician experienced in performing neonatal echocardiograms. 
Laboratory Evaluation
BNP: Found to be elevated at the presentation of congenital or acquired heart disease  and elevated in cardiomyopathy, left-sided obstructive lesions, PDA, and ALCAPA (left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery). Elevated BNP is strongly correlated with heart failure score. 
Troponin: High-sensitivity troponin can be elevated in patients with ASDs and VSDs, as well as anomalous coronary arteries (chronic myocardial ischemia due to poor blood supply to the myocardium). Other theories for the elevation of troponin in CHD include myocardial demand that exceeds oxygenation. In patients with known CHD, high-sensitivity troponin elevation is correlated with adverse outcomes and may be used as a prognostic marker for patients being evaluated. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Prostaglandin infusion can be life-saving in patients with ductal-dependent lesions and usually results in improvements in hypoxia. Notable side effects include apnea, convulsions, fever, leukocytosis, edema, hypokalemia, irritability,  and hypotension.
Previously, patients with prostaglandin infusions requiring transport to a tertiary care facility were intubated because of concern for apneic episodes on route. However, elective intubation has been associated with higher transport complications.  Apneic episodes are less common than previously thought, and emergency medical services can provide appropriate monitoring and positive-pressure ventilation if apnea ensues. 
In patients with hypotension and bradycardia with concern for possible atrioventricular conduction delay, recommendations have been made to consider the use of isoproterenol. 
If the initial presentation of CHD is shock, oxygen is a potent vasoconstrictor of the DA and a vasodilator of the pulmonary arteries and can result in worsened perfusion. It is essential to start PGE1 infusion immediately.
If intubation is required during resuscitation, pretreatment with atropine 0.02 mg/kg is recommended, because these patients may tolerate even small degrees of bradycardia and hypotension poorly.
Fluid management is difficult because of the tenuous relationship between preload and possibly worsening edema; it is recommended that 5-10 mL/kg normal saline boluses be used with careful reassessment, even if sepsis is still a consideration. Concurrent use of antibiotics in a sick neonate with possible CHD is appropriate. Even if the diagnosis of CHD is substantiated, organ (eg, bowel) hypoperfusion can lead to concurrent infections.
In cases of significant acidosis, consider using sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg during resuscitation.
For the treatment of CHF (even if the etiology is unclear), similar to the first-time presentation with shock, the use of oxygen can be detrimental due to pulmonary vasodilation and worsened pulmonary overcirculation and failure. Diuresis with furosemide 1-2 mg/kg IV is a good initial treatment.
In choosing inotropic support in neonatal heart failure, consider the use of dopamine to support heart rate, BP, and urine output at doses of 5-15 μg/kg/min.
Alternatives include dobutamine to reduce afterload with peripheral vasodilation and improved cardiac output without a concurrent increase in BP at a dose of 2.5-15 μg/kg/min.
Milrinone can be used to assist with vasodilation, without a significantly increased heart rate or myocardial oxygen demand. It has a slower onset than dobutamine and dopamine. Dose with an initial bolus of 50 μg/kg over 10-60 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25-0.75 μg/kg/min and titrate to effect. Milrinone has a long half-life; thus, rapid changes in dosing may not yield notable clinical effects as quickly as for other inotropic agents.
Care of Patients After Successful Treatment
If the institution does not have appropriate access to pediatric cardiology or pediatric intensive care, rapid transfer to definitive care is essential in critical CHD patients presenting with shock or decompensated heart failure.",Pediatric Cardiac Disorders
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Anti-epileptic drug (AED) overdose most frequently presents with depressed mentation (sedation or coma).
Patients should be placed on continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
While obtaining vitals, the patient’s blood glucose and ECG should be acquired.
Any inability to manage secretions or an obstructed airway (eg, tongue) should prompt patient repositioning, supplemental oxygen, and possibly an airway adjunct (eg, nasal trumpet); however, if this does not improve symptoms, endotracheal intubation should be considered. Avoid stimulation of the pharyngeal reflex, which can cause vomiting and resultant aspiration.
Hypotension typically responds to intravenous crystalloids; if not, other etiologies of shock must be considered. Vasoactive medications are rarely required.
Seizures:
Benzodiazepines (first-line therapy)
Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV
Repeat 0.1 mg/kg within 5-10 min if seizure does not terminate.
Diazepam 0.15-0.2 mg/kg IV
Double the dose within 5-10 min if seizure does not terminate.
Refractory Seizures:
Adjunct pharmacotherapy
Phenobarbital 20 mg/kg IV (second-line therapy)
Phenytoin
NOT recommended in suspected AED overdoses.
Endotracheal intubation (recommended prior to deep sedation).
For intubated patients, options include:
Propofol 1-2 mg/kg IV followed by 1-10 mg/kg/h infusion
May cause hypotension and respiratory depression.
Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IV followed by 0.06-0.4 mg/kg/h continuous infusion
Preferred agent in the setting of hypotension.
Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) is required for intubated and sedated patients to assess for non-convulsive status.

Seizures occur secondary to uncontrolled neuronal excitation that results from excess glutamate, insufficient γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, or excessive sodium channel blockade in the brain.
Seizures range from minimal or focal motor symptoms to generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.
Epilepsy is a clinical condition of inappropriate neuronal excitation not caused by toxic or metabolic causes that predisposes an individual to recurrent seizures.
Anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs (AED) are used to halt or prevent seizures but are also used as mood stabilizers, for headaches, and for chronic neuropathic pain.
An AED overdose typically results in a decrease in mental status, although overdoses of certain drugs (eg, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin) can induce seizures or dysrhythmias.
Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for seizures in the setting of AED overdose.
Hypotension is usually responsive to intravenous fluid resuscitation.
Anticonvulsant overdoses are often polysubstance ingestions.
Many AEDs have drug-drug interactions (cytochrome-p450 [CYP]; eg, macrolides, azoles, P-glycoprotein inhibitors, protease inhibitors). Ask about any new medications or dosage adjustments.
Key Diagnostic Elements
PITFALLS
Textbook presentation: A middle-aged man with epilepsy presents “intoxicated” with ataxia, slurred speech, and nystagmus. After negative serum ethanol and further investigation, he was found to have phenytoin toxicity.
Intoxication and AED overdose can easily be mistaken if not careful; the triad of depressed mental status, nystagmus, and ataxia is common.
PEARLS
A thorough poisoning history includes time, route, and quantity of exposure; co-ingestants; and onset of symptoms. This history should be obtained directly from the patient; however, collateral (eg, medication bottles) information from emergency medical services, family, friends, and the electronic medical record often must also be ascertained. Equally important is identifying whether the exposure is accidental or intentional.
The most severe poisonings are intentional; in one study, 96% of patients enrolled had overdosed with suicidal intent. 
AED toxicity most reliably presents with a depression in mental status, but the spectrum of symptoms ranges from mild (nystagmus and ataxia) to severe (coma and death).
Overdose with certain drugs (eg, CBZ, lamotrigine) can cause neuronal excitability and induce both seizures and cardiac dysrhythmias.
A carbamazepine (CBZ) level >40 mg/L [>169 µmol/L] is associated with seizures, respiratory failure, dysrhythmia, and coma. In one study, 60% of patients with levels >40 mg/L [>169 µmol/L] had one of the four symptoms and 40% had all four symptoms. 
Some AED levels are easily obtained and aid in overdose treatment (phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate), whereas many others (eg, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, leviceteram) require an outside lab for testing. Therapy is based on patient symptomatology and other surrogate lab markers (eg, transaminases, bilirubin, ammonia, and lactate).
PERSPECTIVES
With an intentional overdose, a full toxic screen, including acetaminophen and salicylate levels, should be considered.
Treatment
A thorough assessment with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care is essential in any case of acute poisoning.
PERSPECTIVES
Decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) is most efficacious when administered early in an acute overdose while the drug is still in the stomach (<2 h). In most cases, seizure due to drug toxicity would preclude administering charcoal in a patient that is not intubated.
The sedated patient who is protecting their airway may only require monitoring, whereas greater degrees of obtundation may require repositioning or supplemental oxygen.
Recurrent seizures, cardiovascular irritability (eg, dysrhythmias), or a waning mental status may necessitate endotracheal intubation.
Hypotension, if present in these patients, responds well to intravenous crystalloids.
Benzodiazepines are the first-line therapy for seizures. Importantly, adults are frequently underdosed.
Lorazepam appropriate weight-based dosing is 0.1 mg/kg. 
The recommended second-line agent for refractory seizures is phenobarbital. Phenytoin, although often used for epileptic seizures, is not recommended in AED overdose.
If deep sedation is required, patients should be intubated. Agents such as propofol or midazolam can be selected based on hemodynamics, with midazolam being preferred in the setting of hypotension. Continuous electroencephalography is required following intubation to assess for non-convulsive status.

Background
The number of AEDs continues to increase. Although toxicity certainly occurs from acute intentional ingestions, nonetheless it may also be subsequent to chronic use, polypharmacy, and resultant drug-drug interactions. Second- and third-generation antiepileptics tend to have fewer drug interactions than first-generation antiepileptics. 
Epidemiology
More than 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy).
Many of these people take AEDs during their lifetime.
The number of calls to U.S. Poison Centers for exposures to AEDs increased from 2013 and 2017. 
Fatalities are uncommon. In 2017, 109 fatalities with reported exposure to AEDs were recorded in the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) database, six of which were single-substance ingestions. 
Pathophysiology
Seizures are caused by uncontrolled, abnormal depolarizations in the brain.
Partial seizures begin in a specific, epileptogenic focus and may secondarily generalize.
Generalized seizures encompass both cerebral hemispheres.
Toxic and metabolic seizures are generalized and often caused by an imbalance in excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) tone.
Seizures occur secondary to uncontrolled neuronal excitation that results from excess glutamate, insufficient γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, or excessive sodium channel blockade in the brain
In toxicity and overdose, the normal disposition (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of a drug may be altered.
AED toxicity may be multifactorial, and providers should consider: 
Intentional versus unintentional overdose.
Pharmacokinetic (drug-drug) interactions. 
CYP-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) interactions: 
CYP3A4 inducers (eg, coumadin) can decrease certain AED levels.
CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, azoles) can increase certain AED levels.
Microsomal epoxide hydrolase:
Carbamazepine (CBZ) levels are elevated by the addition of valproate.
Protein-bound drugs:
Phenytoin (>90% protein bound) is easily displaced from albumin by valproate (>90% protein bound), causing an increase in the free phenytoin concentration. 
Hypersensitivity:
Thought to be caused by aromatic amine antiepileptics metabolized by epoxide hydrolase forming T-cell mediated antigens.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (immune)-associated hypersensitivity: 
HLA-B*1502: phenytoin, lamotrigine
HLA-A*3101: carbamazepine
Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS): 
Typically occurs >14 d after an AED is started
Widespread rash similar to Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) but sparing the mucous membranes and without blistering
Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN): 
Typically occurs ~5-20 d after an AED is started
Severe, acute erythematous rash progressing to full-thickness epidermal necrosis and bullous lesions
AED classes: 
Na+ channel inhibition (fast-acting, voltage-gated sodium channels [VGSC]): CBZ, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, topiramate, and zonisamide.
Selectivity can be lost in overdose interacting with cardiac VGSCs
↑QRS seizures, potential atrioventricular (AV)-nodal blockade
VPA increases GABA synthesis and release, inhibits γ-hydroxybutyric acid, attenuates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated excitation, and blocks T-type Ca2+ channels in peripheral ganglion. 
Carbamazepine (CBZ)
Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a lipophilic antiepileptic and mood stabilizer that structurally resembles a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).
TCA-like effects:
Anticholinergic: Tachycardia, ileus, urinary retention, seizures
Serotonergic: Tremors, hyperreflexia, opsoclonus, myoclonus
PITFALLS
Absorption is slow and unpredictable, especially with controlled release formulation (Tegretol-CR). The delay in peak concentration may be as great as 96 h in a massive overdose. 
Anticholinergic properties resulting in delayed drug absorption, controlled release formulas, and active metabolites may result in secondary concentration peaks and “cyclical coma.” 
Serial levels are essential to help anticipate the clinical course of an acute overdose. Patients may become critically ill hours after exposure.
Although relatively small (236 Da), with a low volume of distribution (0.8-1.4 L/kg), CBZ is highly lipophilic and protein-bound even in acute overdose; CBZ is only moderately dialyzable in an overdose. 
Metabolism/elimination: CBZ is metabolized by CYP3A4 to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide which is, in turn, metabolized by epoxide hydrolase to inactive metabolites.
CBZ-epoxide is less protein-bound but has similar toxicity to CBZ. Children are faster CYP metabolizers than adults, yielding more free serum CBZ-epoxide and higher apparent toxicity at lower CBZ levels. 
If CBZ is initiated from ED for trigeminal neuralgia or any other indication, then it requires reliable follow-up for a repeat level and potential dose adjustment.
The mechanism for seizure in an overdose is not well defined. Anticholinergic effects and differential action at adenosine receptors (A1 inhibitor, A2A inducer) are thought to play a role. 
The CBZ drug-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is rare in isolation but is more common in individuals >40 y old and who are taking other SIADH-inducing drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).  Hyponatremia, if present, may also contribute to seizures.
CBZ can both inhibit and induce enzymes in the porphyrin pathway and should be avoided in patients with a history of hepatic porphyria.
There is evidence of fetal risk based on investigational or marketing experience (former category D). CBZ is associated with neural tube defects in monotherapy and with other AEDs such as valproic acid. Cleft lip/palate and urogenital abnormalities are reported. 
Related drugs
Oxcarbazepine is a prodrug undergoing presystemic reduction to licarbazepine, which is an active compound with characteristics similar to CBZ.
This rate-limiting step and shorter elimination half-life of licarbazepine may limit its toxicity in a case of single acute ingestion. 
Eslicarbazepine is the S-(+) enantiomer of licarbazepine.
Valproic acid (VPA)
VPA is a small-chain, branched carboxylic acid, a broad-spectrum antiepileptic, mood stabilizer, and a first-line medication for migraine prophylaxis.
VPA is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with a bioavailability >80%. Delayed absorption occurs in extended-release preparations (divalproex sodium, Depakote ER, Depakote Sprinkles). In therapeutic dosing, immediate release preparations (valproic acid, sodium valproate, Depakene) often reach peak concentration in <4 h; extended-release preparations reach peak concentration in ≥18 h. 
As a small molecule (144 Da) with a low volume of distribution (0.1-0.5 L/kg), VPA exhibits saturable protein binding, with 90-95% bound at therapeutic concentrations (50-100 mg/L [346-693 µmol/L]) and ~15-34% bound at >1,000 mg/L [6934 µmol/L]):  VPA is dialyzable in an overdose. 
Metabolism/elimination: VPA has extensive hepatic biotransformation, ~30-50% glucuronidation, ~40% mitochondrial β-oxidation, ~15-20% cytosolic ω-oxidation and other oxidation, and <3% excreted unchanged in the urine. 
Toxicity
Direct hepatotoxicity occurs from alkene derivatives of VPA (eg, 4-ene-VPA and propionic acid) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
CoA depletion. Acetyl-CoA is necessary for the formation of N-acetylglutamate. This results in hyperammonemia.
Carnitine depletion. Carnitine depletion results from the accumulation of uncycled carnitine-acyl-CoA derivatives and the inhibition of intracellular carnitine transporter by valproate-carnitine, in addition to other mechanisms.
Glutathione depletion from thiol conjugation of 4-ene-VPA and 2,4-diene-VPA. 
β-oxidation: Produces intermediate products of metabolism such as 2-ene-VPA, which is implicated in cerebral edema. 
ω-oxidation: Produces intermediate products of metabolism such as 4-ene-VPA, which inhibits carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. 
VPA is contraindicated in many mitochondrial disorders, urea-cycle defects, hepatic dysfunction, and some inborn errors of metabolism. Subclinical disorders of fatty acid metabolism in children may manifest after therapy. 
Hepatic injury and hyperammonemia are common even in therapeutic dosing; microvesicular steatosis results from mitochondrial dysfunction. 
In pregnancy, VPA is associated with neural tube defects including spina bifida, intellectual deficits, and autism spectrum disorders. 
Phenytoin and fosphenytoin (Dilantin, diphenylhydantoin)
Phenytoin is a weak acid with poor water solubility.  Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin that can be administered safely via intravenous and intramuscular routes.
Intravenous phenytoin is dissolved in propylene glycol (40%) and ethanol (10%) buffered with NaOH to a pH of 12 (highly basic).  Extravasations can cause severe caustic injury.
Absorption in therapeutic doses is slow; complete absorption with a peak serum concentration occurs in 1.5-5 h. 
Extended release peaks at 4-12 h; intravenous fosphenytoin reaches a peak phenytoin serum concentration in 15-30 min.
In an overdose, absorption may continue for days or even weeks.
Despite a low volume of distribution (0.6-0.7 L/kg), a high degree of protein binding occurs even in an overdose. Only free phenytoin is pharmacologically active.
Metabolism/elimination: CYP450, particularly 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.
The half-life is variable but generally thought to be 22 h in normal dosing.
Michaelis-Menten kinetics:
Near therapeutic steady state, the half-life is first order.
Metabolism changes to zero-order at >10 μg/mL, meaning the half-life continues to lengthen as the concentration increases (similar to ethanol intoxication). 
Chronic overdose can cause gingival hyperplasia, frontal bossing, and behavioral changes.
In pregnancy, phenytoin is linked to fetal hydantoin syndrome, which is characterized by craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and mental deficiency. 
Lamotrigine
Lamotrigine is a lipophilic antiepileptic and mood stabilizer.
Lamotrigine is available in both immediate- and extended-release formulations.
A relatively small molecule (256 Da), with a low volume of distribution (1.25-1.5 L/kg) but lipophilic ~55% protein bound. Theoretically amenable to dialysis in an overdose.
Metabolism/elimination: Primarily through glucuronidation.
A long but variable elimination half-life in therapeutic dosing. Affected by hepatic and renal impairment as well as the co-administration of other AEDs.
Multiple reports of seizures in an overdose in patients with and without epilepsy. The mechanism for seizure in an overdose is not well defined. Myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and serotonin syndrome related to serotonin reuptake inhibition have been described. 
Dysrhythmias are thought to be related to sodium channel blockade. 
There are no adequate studies of lamotrigine use in pregnancy by which to assess fetal risk (former category C). 
Diagnostic Considerations
Seizures can occur in some AED overdoses.
The neurologic status of overdose patients ranges from “intoxicated appearing” to comatose; nystagmus, ataxia, and incoordination are frequent in milder overdoses.
Cardiovascular instability (tachy-bradydysrhythmias, AV block, hypertension, or hypotension) is more common with certain AEDs (eg, CBZ, lamotrigine).
Uniquely, CBZ overdose may also present with anticholinergic or serotonergic findings.
Radiographic studies are only necessary to exclude alternative medical diagnoses.
Laboratory analysis includes obtaining certain AED levels, a chemistry panel, and where appropriate a hepatic function panel with albumin.
Carbamazepine (CBZ)
Therapeutic levels 4-12 mg/L [17-51 µmol/L] (potential toxicity in acute exposure); >20 mg/L [>85 µmol/L] expected toxicity; and >40 mg/L [>169 µmol/L] potentially life-threatening toxicity.
In overdose, levels should be repeated every 2-6 h with chemistry.
A worsening clinical status without an increasing level may be due to either the primary effect of active metabolites (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide) or the redistribution of CBZ to target organs (brain, heart).
An increasing level suggests ongoing absorption, impaired metabolism and elimination, or both; these observations may precede a relapse in symptoms or “cyclical coma.”
In addition to the CNS depression that is shared with most AEDs in acute toxicity, CBZ can cause cerebellar signs and dysarthria at <20 mg/L [<85 µmol/L], somnolence at 20-30 mg/L [85-127 µmol/L], and coma at >30 mg/L [>127 µmol/L].  Levels >40 mg/L [>169 µmol/L] in adults are associated with mental status and respiratory depression requiring intubation, status epilepticus, and cardiac abnormalities (QRS prolongation, AV block, dysrhythmias). 
In children with moderate to severe exposures, neurological findings (choreoathetosis, dystonic reaction, seizures) may be more common than cardiac conduction defects.  In children, levels >40 mg/L [>169 µmol/L] are associated with respiratory failure and hypotension.
Patients with CBZ overdose exhibit anticholinergic (tachycardia, ileus, urinary retention) and serotonergic (hyperreflexia, tremors myoclonus) symptoms, given its TCA-like nature.
Idiosyncratic reactions are uncommon but a known risk. Leukopenia is seen in ~12% of children and ~7% of adults and is often transient, occurring in the first few months. Aplastic anemia is quite rare. 
Hepatotoxicity is likewise thought to be immune-mediated from oxidized intermediates. Hepatotoxicity may be associated with rash and eosinophilia mild transaminitis, elevated γ-glutamyltransferase, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. 
Prognosis
A large retrospective analysis of CBZ overdoses reported a ~13% fatality rate. There was no association between serum CBZ level and outcome. The mean dose ingested by survivors was 9.5 g, and the mean dose ingested by fatalities was 23.6 g. Favorable outcomes were associated with somnolence or confusion without coma and cerebellar syndrome. Seizures were associated with fatality. Additional deaths were secondary to cardiac arrest, renal failure, and respiratory failure. 
Valproic Acid (VPA)
Ingestions <200 mg/kg usually cause mild sedation; ingestions >400 mg/kg potentially cause coma, cerebral edema, and hemodynamic instability. 
VPA levels and chemistry should be repeated every 2-6 h, but LFTs (transaminases, bilirubin, ammonia) do not require trending unless initially abnormal or the patient’s clinical status changes.
L-carnitine levels do not represent total body stores and are typically not useful to guide treatment. Likewise, levels of VPA intermediates (4-ene-VPA, 2-ene-VPA, and 2,4-ene-VPA) are typically not available in a timely manner and do not guide treatment.
Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE) is associated with both acute and chronic VPA toxicity. VHE is determined by end-organ symptoms (ie, altered mental status) and may not correlate with VPA level or ammonia. Acute toxicity is associated with high VPA and ammonia levels, whereas chronic toxicity is associated with therapeutic VPA levels and elevated ammonia. Seizures and cerebral edema may be present as with other causes of hepatic encephalopathy and hyperammonemia.
Hyperammonemia is related to inhibition of the urea cycle, which is associated with increased catabolism of proteins and carnitine deficiency.  Ammonia may be elevated in asymptomatic patients.
Idiosyncratic reactions most commonly affect the liver, causing a mild transaminitis (~44% patients) during the initial months of treatment.
Fulminant liver failure is rare.  A Reye’s-like syndrome is more common in children <2 y old on multiple AEDs, those on a ketogenic diet, those with inborn errors of metabolism, or those with developmental delay (eg, cerebral palsy). 
Both leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are seen following severe VPA overdose.  Marrow suppression is usually transient.
Pancreatitis has also been reported with severe intoxication. 
PITFALLS
Radiographic evaluation should include head CT in cases of stupor/coma, hyperammonemia, or prolonged altered mental status to assess for cerebral edema. Note: cerebral edema may be delayed for 12 h to 4 d, particularly with extended-release preparations. 
Prognosis
In a large retrospective poison center-based study, levels >450 mg/L [>3120 µmol/L] were associated with moderate or major outcomes, and levels >850 mg/L [>5894 µmol/L] were associated with coma, respiratory depression, aspiration, and metabolic acidosis.
Anion-gap metabolic acidosis (lactic, ketoacids, propionic acid) is associated with poor prognosis.
Improvement in mental status is greatest when HD is initiated early after neurologic changes. 
Phenytoin
Phenytoin is highly protein-bound; free phenytoin is the only pharmacologically active form. The utility of a total phenytoin level has its limits. In otherwise healthy individuals with normal albumin levels, total phenytoin levels correlate relatively well to the severity of neurological symptoms: 
<20 μg/mL [<79 µmol/L]: Typically no symptoms except for mild horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze.
>20-40 μg/mL [79-159 µmol/L]: Nystagmus, ataxia, tremor, vomiting, and hyperreflexia.
>40-50 μg/mL [159-198 µmol/L]: Altered mental status, lethargy, choreoathetoid, or a paradoxical hyperactivity.
>50 μg/mL [>198 µmol/L]: Coma and seizures are reported. 
Phenytoin toxicity primarily affects the vestibular and cerebellum system.
At high doses and infusion rates, adverse cardiovascular events such as bradycardia, hypotension, and high-degree AV blocks have been reported. 
PITFALLS
Idiosyncratic reactions such as purple glove syndrome, which is a blue-purple discoloration of the extremity with the infusion catheter, can result in necrosis, although rare. Ischemia and amputations have been reported. 
A vitamin K-dependent coagulopathy has been reported in children.  Agranulocytosis,  immune-mediated hepatotoxicity,  and DRESS have also been reported with phenytoin. 
PEARLS
Importantly, the total phenytoin level should be obtained with labs; the free phenytoin level is often a send-out lab. In patients with altered protein binding, the total phenytoin concentration does not correlate well with either the symptoms of toxicity or therapeutic effect. Correcting the phenytoin concentration is helpful because patients with low protein binding are more susceptible to the adverse effects of phenytoin. The original Winter-Tozer calculation was used for this purpose but has been repeatedly shown to overpredict. Several updated correction formulas are available: 
Corrected phenytoin = (measured phenytoin/[0.275 × albumin + 0.1]). The estimated free phenytoin is 10% of this result. 
Prognosis
Neurologic symptoms such as altered mental status, ataxia, and tremor were not observed at phenytoin concentrations <20 μg/mL.
In a large review of case reports and retrospective and prospective studies, only one cardiovascular serious adverse event occurred in patients taking oral phenytoin. The adverse cardiovascular symptoms most commonly observed were in patients given intravenous phenytoin and were related to infusion rate. Patients given an infusion rate >50 mg/min were at risk for hypotension and bradycardia.  Fosphenytoin does not contain propylene glycol or ethanol and is not associated with infusion-related adverse events.
Lamotrigine
The common reference range levels are 5-15 μg/mL (potential toxicity in acute exposure); ~60% with adverse effects requiring dose adjustment at >20 μg/mL.  Levels are typically not available and are not used to guide management.
In addition to the CNS depression shared with most AEDs in acute toxicity, somnolence, ataxia, dysarthria, and tachycardia are relatively common. Patients with acute overdose are more likely to have adverse effects than patients with chronic or acute on chronic (note: acute = single, repeated, or continuous exposure for ≤8 h; chronic = continuous, repeated, or intermittent exposure for >8 h and, acute-on-chronic = single exposure preceded by continuous, repeated, or intermittent exposure for >8). 
In pediatric patients, seizures, including status epilepticus, can present at therapeutic levels. 
Idiosyncratic reactions include hepatotoxicity and skin reactions with eosinophilia, but specific predisposing HLA alleles have not been identified. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Intentional AED overdoses that have expected neurological or cardiovascular toxicity should be referred to an ED and observed in a monitored unit with telemetry. Many symptomatic patients will require admission to an intensive care unit.
Short-acting parenteral benzodiazepines are the first-line therapy for seizures. Midazolam or lorazepam is preferred to diazepam in patients with liver disease. Status epilepticus in drug toxicity often requires intubation. Strongly consider selecting AEDs that increase GABA-ergic tone such as phenobarbital and propofol rather than those that suppress sustained neuronal firing through blockade of VGSCs, such as phenytoin. 
The enhanced elimination of AEDs is recommended via intermittent HD for drugs that are dialyzable. Consider renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in settings that preclude intermittent HD (eg, hypotension).
Focused therapies
Sodium bicarbonate 1-3 ampules 8.4% (50 mEq of Na+ in 50-mL ampule) IV push. A hypertonic sodium bolus temporarily overcomes sodium channel blockade of TCAs and related drugs (eg, CBZ).
Indications include an ECG with a widened QRS-complex. Extrapolating data from TCA overdoses, a QRS >100-120 ms increases seizure risk and >160 ms increases ventricular dysrhythmia risk.  An elevation in terminal R wave >3 mm in aVR is also associated with a clinically significant sodium channel blockade.  Comparison with a previous ECG for potential pre-existing conduction delay is recommended. Prompt reassessment (5-10 min) of vitals and repeat 12-lead ECG to compare and assess for response (>20-ms reduction in QRS or improvement in clinical status) are warranted.
PITFALLS
Although there is no established maximum dose for sodium bicarbonate, its use is limited by risk of metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia. Obtain serial chemistry and venous blood gas with multiple administrations.
Intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) 20%: 1.5 mL/kg (70-kg patient, 100 mL) bolus over 2-3 min followed by an infusion; start at 0.25 mL/kg/min over 30-60 min with rapid titration to the lowest effective dose or begin at 0.025 mL/kg/min to reduce potential complications from lipemia. 
Despite recent popularity, consensus only exists for IFE in local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), specifically bupivacaine.
PERSPECTIVES
Multiple case reports have described IFE as an adjunct to aggressive supportive care measures. Use may be reasonable in lipid-soluble drugs that exhibit severe neurologic- or cardiotoxicity.
Interference with colorimetric laboratory assays for several hours should be expected. Lipemic pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress, and interference with HD and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits have been described.
Carbamazepine (CBZ)
PITFALLS
Clinical symptoms rather than drug levels should guide treatment.
Free drug in serum redistributes to target organs, and active metabolites may cause a discrepancy in drug level and apparent toxicity.
Activated charcoal (AC) (single and multi-dose)
It is reasonable to administer a single dose in the appropriately selected patient.
The American College of Medical Toxicologists recognizes the utility of multi-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) for acute CBZ toxicity.  Although no prospective trials demonstrate a change in clinical outcome, MDAC may decrease mechanical ventilation and ICU days. 
Cautious use in conjunction with serial levels for patients on CBZ for the control of epilepsy, because subtherapeutic levels may lower seizure threshold.
PEARLS
Potential for ileus, specifically with the anticholinergic effects of CBZ. Serial abdominal exams and assessment of bowel sounds are recommended.
Sodium bicarbonate
For patients with hypotension and prolonged QRS (>120-160 ms).
PERSPECTIVES
No studies exist on the choice of antiarrhythmic agent. By mechanism of phase 0,2,4 inhibition, it would seem reasonable to avoid Class Ia agents, such as procainamide and Class Ic agents such as flecainide.  Lidocaine is a reasonable choice because its fast-acting sodium channel inhibition may displace the toxin.
Intralipid emulsion therapy (ILE)
There are several case reports of the use of ILE in CBZ overdose and with TCAs, although insufficient evidence exists to recommend its routine use.
Physostigmine
Not recommended because toxicity is likely multifactorial and the effect of physostigmine is transient.
Extracorporeal elimination
Although there is a relatively short therapeutic elimination half-life with chronic use (12-17 h), nonetheless there is a longer apparent half-life in cases of overdose due to the ongoing absorption and saturated elimination kinetics.
Expert consensus recommends the potential use of intermittent HD in cases of refractory seizures or life-threatening dysrhythmias. 
Valproic Acid
Consider repeat drug levels if ongoing absorption is suspected or with an extended-release preparation.
Activated charcoal (single dose)
Reasonable to administer single-dose AC in the appropriately selected patient.
Experimental evidence does not support MDAC for VPA intoxication. 
Extracorporeal elimination
Indications
VPA level >1,300 mg/L [>8321 µmol/L]
Cerebral edema
Hemodynamic instability
Suggested
VPA level >900 mg/L [>6241 µmol/L]
Acidosis (pH <7.1)
Coma/respiratory depression requiring intubation
Acute hyperammonemia with associated mental status changes
Intermittent HD is preferred to charcoal hemoperfusion due to its superior clearance of ammonia and correction of acidosis.
Although an option for procedural-related hypotension or with cerebral edema, CRRT is associated with a slower clinical improvement. 
The benefit of L-carnitine with HD is unclear. A lack of availability of L-carnitine should not delay HD.
L-carnitine (eg, Carnitor 1 g per 5-mL vial)
Acute VPA toxicity 100 mg/kg IV (up to 6 g) over 30 min, followed by 15 mg/kg infused over 30 min q6h until signs of severe poisoning resolve.
Indicated for hepatotoxicity. 
Considerations:
Severe VPA overdose >450 mg/L [>3120 µmol/L]
Symptomatic hyperammonemia (altered mental status)
Neonates on total parenteral nutrition 
It remains unclear whether L-carnitine is beneficial for asymptomatic hyperammonemia in a setting of mild to moderate VPA overdose. L-carnitine may not hasten the recovery of coma, and hyperammonemia may be a delayed finding. 
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare; they are not reported for VPA overdose but are reported for the supplementation of carnitine deficiency and are known to be more common in patients with end-stage renal disease.
Carnitine supplementation may be useful in certain children with carnitine deficiency or with complex neurological disorders in conjunction with a neurologist. 
Phenytoin
Drug concentrations tend to correlate with symptoms; however, due to its degree of high protein binding, some physiologic states will have increased free phenytoin (the pharmacologically active form).
Activated charcoal
It is reasonable to administer single-dose AC in the appropriately selected patient.
A repeat dose can be considered if ongoing absorption is suspected with an extended-release preparation. MDAC has been shown to reduce the apparent half-life of phenytoin. Evidence of improvement in patient-centered outcomes (length of stay, need for intubation, need for HD) is lacking. 
Extracorporeal elimination
HD has been reported for severe cases of phenytoin overdose. The EXTRIP working group states that it is reasonable to use intermittent HD in selected cases of phenytoin overdose, including prolonged coma or prolonged, incapacitating ataxia. 
The membrane adsorbents recirculating system (MARS) has been used with a significant reported reduction in phenytoin concentration and improvement in clinical status.  Additional human trials are lacking.
Lamotrigine
Treatment is largely supportive, with sodium bicarbonate as a reasonable intervention for QRS prolongation. The efficacy of its use remains unclear.
Case reports have described the use of intralipid fat emulsion with QRS prolongation and hemodynamic instability unresponsive to other therapies.  The use of lamotrigine can be considered in severe intoxication cases that remain unresponsive to other supportive measures.",Anticonvulsants

Approach to the Critical Patient
Calcium channel blocker (CCB) or beta blocker (BB) toxicity predominantly results in cardiovascular deterioration.
All patients require continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
While obtaining vital signs, blood glucose and ECG should be acquired.
Initial management should always focus on ensuring adequate airway patency, protection, and respiration.
Central nervous system (CNS) depression (eg, altered mental status) is infrequently observed, with the exception of certain lipophilic BBs, and typically does not require invasive airway intervention; however, if such intervention is required, extreme caution must be taken.
The poisoned cardiovascular system has a limited ability to counteract the loss of adrenergic tone, decrease in vascular resistance, and increase in intrathoracic pressure associated with endotracheal intubation. Resultant cardiac arrest is not uncommon given the poor reserve. Preventative measures include:
IV crystalloid resuscitation before intubation,
Half dosing a hemodynamically stable induction agent, and
Vasoactive infusion before and immediately after the intubation period.
Hypotension should be treated with IV crystalloid resuscitation:
Administer 10-20 mL/kg, repeat dose if patient is fluid-responsive (assess bedside echocardiography).

Gluconate 3-6 g IV q10-20min or 0.06-0.12 g/kg/h

Intralipid fat emulsion (20%)
1.5 mL/kg over 2-3 min (eg, 100 mL for a 70-kg patient)
Infusion: 0.25 mL/kg/min with rapid titration to the lowest effective dose or begin at 0.025 mL/kg/min and titrate up to reduce complications from lipemia
BB toxicity

Glucagon
3-10 mg IV bolus followed by 3-5 mg/h
Beta agonists
Isoproterenol 20-60 μg IV bolus followed by 1-20 μg/min
Toxicity refractory to the above medications may require interventions such as incremental doses of high-dose insulin (up to 10 U/kg/h), transvenous pacing for symptomatic bradycardia or high-grade conduction delay, or use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Key Concepts
CCBs are used in the treatment of hypertension, dysrhythmias, and migraines (prophylaxis); they are also used in various vascular conditions (eg, pulmonary hypertension, Raynaud’s disease, and subarachnoid hemorrhage).
BBs are commonly used for the management of hypertension, congestive heart failure, dysrhythmias, migraine, esophageal varices, and glaucoma.
In toxicity, CCBs and BBs have nearly analogous presentations: hypotension, bradydysrhythmias, shock, and death.
PITFALLS
Overdose should be suspected in any patient with recalcitrant hypotension, especially if the history suggests depression, prior suicide attempt, or access to these medications (eg, children/unintentional ingestion).
Classically hyperglycemia is indicative of CCB toxicity, whereas hypoglycemia points toward BB toxicity.
Laboratory tests should not be used to confirm or exclude toxicity.
Treatment is largely supportive but requires aggressive resuscitation and medication management.
Key Diagnostic Elements
A thorough poisoning history includes time, route, and quantity of exposure; co-ingestants; and onset of symptoms. This information should be obtained directly from the patient; however, collateral information (eg, medication bottles) from emergency medical services, family, friends, and the electronic medical record must also be ascertained. Equally important is identifying whether the exposure was accidental or intentional.
History of depression is common among adults; a high index of suspicion is required for an early identification of overdose, given that the presenting signs and symptoms are non-specific.
CCB and BB toxicity is not always associated with hemodynamic compromise; other signs of poor perfusion include fatigue, weakness, nausea, and decreased urine output.
Notable physical exam findings include bradycardia (>50%), hypotension (>50%), and, less commonly, CNS depression.
Hyperglycemia is common with CCB overdose, whereas hypoglycemia (relative or absolute) may be encountered with BB overdose.
Hypokalemia may be encountered with CCB ingestion.
Metabolic acidosis, renal insufficiency, and other signs of hypoperfusion may be encountered with both CCBs and BBs.
Routine diagnostic imaging and drug screens are not helpful.
In the setting of an intentional ingestion, obtaining a full toxicology screen, including acetaminophen, salicylates, and ethanol levels, is prudent.
Treatment
Initial management of both CCB and BB toxicity begins with IV crystalloid resuscitation, which should begin at 10-20 mL/kg. Early bedside echocardiography should subsequently guide the additional fluid administration. Evaluations of the heart (ejection fraction and wall motion), vena cava (size and collapsibility), and lungs (pulmonary edema) are integral.
If hemodynamics (blood pressure/heart rate/mental status) improve with crystalloids and there are no signs of myocardial dysfunction or pulmonary edema, a second bolus should be initiated with the addition of calcium, high-dose insulin, and dextrose infusions.
Glucagon and atropine may be given for symptomatic bradycardia (BB toxicity).
If hypotension recurs despite the above therapy, IV vasopressors (norepinephrine is preferred if there are no signs of myocardial dysfunction) should be started. Isoproterenol can be considered if hypotension is associated with bradycardia.
If echocardiography reveals signs of myocardial dysfunction and/or poor vena cava collapsibility, the patient should not receive additional fluids, and monotherapy with high-dose insulin should be considered. Higher doses of insulin therapy may be required. The vasoactive agent of choice to initiate in this circumstance is epinephrine.
Refractory hemodynamic instability despite increasing doses of vasoactive agents warrants consideration of either intralipid emulsion therapy or extracorporeal circulation.

"Deep Dive
Background
CCBs block voltage-gated calcium channels responsible for excitation of the myocardium and smooth and skeletal muscle.
BBs inhibit epinephrine and norepinephrine adrenergic stimulation on beta receptors; these receptors are found on the heart, smooth muscles, arteries, airways, kidneys, and other tissues.
Both CCB and BB overdoses are associated with cardiovascular compromise, but CCBs are associated with more adverse effects.
Epidemiology
In 2017, U.S. poison control centers received approximately 40,000 calls involving CCBs or BBs. 
CCBs and BBs were involved in more than 8% of all drug-induced fatalities reported to U.S. poison control centers. 
Pathophysiology
There are 3 classes of CCBs currently used in the U.S.: dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine, nicardipine), benzothiazepines (eg, diltiazem), and phenylalkylamines (eg, verapamil).
While all CCBs antagonize L-type calcium channels, dihydropyridines have a preference for L-type calcium channels in the periphery, whereas non-dihydropyridines (verapamil and diltiazem) have a preference for antagonizing L-type calcium channels more centrally.
Antagonism of the calcium channels decreases calcium influx, resulting in impaired muscle contraction. Furthermore, calcium channel antagonists impair insulin release, resulting in intracellular hypoglycemia and a subsequent shift in the myocardial cells from carbohydrates to free fatty acids as the myocardial substrate, rendering the cells less efficient at energy production. 
BBs antagonize beta receptors. Normally, under physiological conditions, activation of the beta receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase to convert adenosine triphosphate into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). By blocking the beta receptor, cAMP production is reduced, and ultimately, protein kinase production is reduced. In myocardial cells, this inhibition results in a decrease in inotropy and chronotropy.
Antagonism of non-cardiac beta receptors impairs gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, resulting in potential hypoglycemia.
Certain unique BBs have membrane-stabilizing effects (eg, propranolol, acebutolol), which results in intraventricular conduction delay, widening of the QRS complex, and seizures through sodium channel blocking effects. In contrast, some BBs (eg, acebutolol or sotalol) produce a potassium efflux channel blockade, resulting in QT prolongation and increased risk of torsades de pointes, especially as the heart rate falls.
The use of high-dose insulin is thought to improve hemodynamic parameters because of direct inotropic effects independent of cAMP, anti-inflammatory effects, and antioxidant effects. Additionally, insulin may allow the heart to again utilize carbohydrates as the predominant energy source, rather than fatty acids. In canine models of beta blocker and calcium channel antagonists, high-dose insulin has been shown as superior to epinephrine and glucagon in animal survivability. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Although all CCBs and BBs can cause hypotension, the dihydropyridine class of CCBs may cause mild reflex tachycardia because of its peripheral effects in cases of a small overdose. Large overdoses of dihydropyridines, however, would be expected to result in bradycardia and hypotension.
ECG may reveal sinus rhythm, bradycardia, junctional rhythm, or atrioventricular blocks. Select BBs (propranolol, acebutolol, and sotalol) may result in QRS or QT prolongation.
Laboratory studies may reveal hypokalemia and hyperglycemia with CCB toxicity and may reveal hypoglycemia (relative or absolute) with BB toxicity.
Hypoperfusion may result in metabolic acidosis or acute kidney injury if hypotension is severe.
No specific radiographic study is warranted, although CCB toxicity may be associated with a slightly increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, with the development of pleural effusions following resuscitation.
Therapeutic Considerations
Decontamination with activated charcoal is most efficacious while the toxicant is in the stomach (<2 h); however, the patient must be cooperative and hemodynamically stable and have a patent airway.
Assessing perfusion requires not only monitoring of hemodynamics but also evaluation of various surrogate markers, such as urine output, mental status, and serial lactate levels.
Warm, pink skin suggests good tissue perfusion; however, given that dihydropyridines vasodilate, this may be a false reassurance of adequate perfusion.
The use of bedside echocardiography will greatly aid in guiding therapy.
CCBs tend to sequester fluids and can cause large pleural effusions; before extubating a CCB-toxic patient, it is prudent to consider furosemide for diuresis if pleural effusions are present.
If utilizing high-dose insulin in conjunction with a vasopressor, it is critically important to add exogenous dextrose (eg, D10W) once the serum glucose falls below 250 mg/dL. Glucose levels often decrease as the liver starts to metabolize again, corresponding to reduced vasopressor requirements.",Beta and Calcium Channel Blockers

Key Concepts
Patients often neglect reporting these exposures when asked about home medications. Specifically inquire about over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription home remedies, ethnic therapies, herbal supplements, alternative remedies, dietary supplements, weight loss supplements, sexual enhancement medications, and athletic enhancement medication exposures.
When a patient reports exposure to a dietary supplement, look for signs and symptoms of toxicity due to the reported substance, but also consider exposure to other unidentified substances.
The combination of an unreliable history and a lack of rapid laboratory confirmation of exposure requires observation for toxidromes supported by the patient’s history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing.
Diagnostic testing should include a general surveillance for end-organ toxicity of the CNS, cardiac, pulmonary, GI (hepatic), hematologic, and renal systems.
Drugs-of-abuse screening should not determine acute clinical decision-making.
Management should always start with assessment and treatment of the ABCDs, including treatment with dextrose and naloxone if indicated.
GI decontamination should be considered if applicable and timely and if the benefits outweigh the risks.
Enhanced elimination with sodium bicarbonate infusion, multiple-dose activated charcoal, or hemodialysis (HD) should be considered if applicable.
Consultation with a medical toxicologist or regional poison center (1-800-222-1222) is recommended.

Background
Dietary supplements, as defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) in the U.S., are products intended to supplement the diet and contain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, other dietary substances, and/or herbs or other botanicals. 
Ingredients and adulterants in dietary supplements are not subject to quality control across the globe, including the U.S. Sometimes they are compounded with controlled and legitimate pharmaceuticals or metals. 
Because dietary supplements are categorized as food, they are not regulated with regard to their therapeutic benefit, and a risk/benefit analysis is not part of the existing regulatory paradigm. 
Epidemiology
The National Poison Data System reported 51,653 herbal or dietary supplement exposures in 2017. Of those exposures, 34,265 occurred in children ≤ 5 y old, with a fatality rate of 3%. 
Diagnostic/Therapeutic Considerations
Cardiac glycosides such as digitoxigenin, oleandrin, and folinerin are commonly found in the oleander plant. They exert their effects by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pumps found in cardiac myocytes, which ultimately leads to increased intracellular calcium levels, resulting in a reduced heart rate and elevated inotropy. 
Aconite, found in the plant Aconitum carmichaeli debx, is used in traditional Chinese medicine by boiling the roots of the herb. However, clinical effects can be observed when the plant is consumed unprepared, insufficiently boiled, or ingested in excessive quantities.
Clinical effects of these agents include dysrhythmias, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and paresthesias, among other symptoms.
Special attention should be given to the patient’s ECG. These patients should be kept on telemetry, as the two leading causes of death in aconite poisoning are refractory ventricular tachycardia and asystole. 
Kava, PAs, kratom, pennyroyal, sassafras, chaparral, and germander are herbal supplements known to have a hepatotoxic profile upon consumption. Risk factors for drug-induced liver injury include increased age, chronic alcoholism, and female gender, resulting in an increased burden for these herbal agents. 
Acute toxicity resembles acute hepatitis, while chronic toxicity can resemble chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Symptoms may include fatigue, pruritus, loss of appetite, and a tender liver.
Kava is used in traditional medicine for its anxiolytic effects and is also used to treat agitation and insomnia. Kava pyrones are the active compounds responsible for its pharmacological effect associated with hepatotoxicity.  The traditional kava drink is produced from aqueous extract of the roots of Piper methysticum.
Kratom is an herbal supplement widely used for its opioid-like side effects and for increasing stamina, among other traditional uses. This supplement is derived from an evergreen tree that is indigenous to southeast Asia. 
Experimental evidence shows that kratom acts on mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors, with additional alpha-2 adrenergic agonist activity as well. 
PAs such as riddelline and symphytine are found in the Comfrey plant. PAs are currently banned in the U.S. due to their known hepatotoxic effects. These agents exhibit toxicity via the active metabolite pyrrolic ester, resulting in mitochondrial dysregulation or even hepatic veno-occlusive disease. 
Germander is cited in traditional medicine as an aid for weight loss and gout treatment and exerts antipyretic effects; 
The tea leaves and oil of pennyroyal have been used to induce abortion, treat colic, or stimulate menses. Case reports describe a wide range of presentations from mild liver injury to coma or even death. Pennyroyal is metabolized in the liver through CYP2E1 to a hepatotoxic metabolite pulegone.

"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
The mainstay for acute poisoning is a thorough assessment with contemporaneous patient stabilization (ensuring airway patency/protection, continuous cardiac monitoring), resuscitation (initiation of intravenous crystalloids), and supportive care.
Once a patient is verified as digoxin toxic, the provider must determine whether digoxin-Fab is indicated.
If an individual is bradycardic but mentating well without signs of hemodynamic compromise (altered mental status, dysrhythmias, hypotension), treatment may be limited to supportive care in a monitored setting.
Life-threatening toxicity warrants treatment with digoxin-Fab:
Cardiac instability (tachy-bradydysrhythmias, hyperkalemia)

Meds: Digoxin-Fab IV 10 vials for adults and 5 vials for children
Audio Board Review EM:RAP Audio
Key Concepts
Digoxin is derived from the foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea).
Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside; it has a positive inotropic effect on the heart and increases vagal tone, which renders digoxin optimal for the treatment of atrial tachydysrhythmias with concurrent congestive heart failure.
The pharmacokinetic profile of digoxin is complex, exhibiting a narrow therapeutic range and numerous drug-drug interactions; other important considerations include age, body habitus, renal function, and comorbid conditions.
Toxicity can be acute or chronic; acute toxicity tends to occur in younger individuals with an abrupt onset of symptoms, whereas chronic toxicity tends to occur in elderly individuals with a gradual onset and vague symptoms.
Treatment for both acute and chronic toxicity may include the use of digoxin-specific antibody fragments (digoxin-Fab).
PITFALLS
Knowledge of the digoxin level may be helpful in guiding initial therapy, but the diagnosis and the decision to administer digoxin-Fab should not be based exclusively on the digoxin concentration, as clinical factors are more important.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Acute toxicity often manifests as an abrupt onset of gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and neurological (confusion, lethargy) symptoms.
Most deaths are secondary to cardiac manifestations of toxicity (brady-tachydysrhythmias, hyperkalemia, hypotension).
Premature ventricular contractions are the most common finding in electrocardiography (ECG).
There are no pathognomonic ECG findings, but bidirectional ventricular tachycardia is a rare finding that can be seen with digoxin or other cardioactive glycosides. ECG
The scooping/downsloping of the ST segment commonly referred to as the “dig effect” or “Salvador Dali” sign is observed in cases of chronic digoxin use and is not a marker of acute toxicity. ECG
Chronic toxicity typically occurs in elderly patients, with a more gradual onset of symptoms, including fatigue, malaise, nausea, dizziness, and visual disturbances such as xanthopsia (yellow haloes), chromatopsia (color vision disturbances), scotomas, and reduced acuity.
Chronic toxicity is often precipitated by drug-drug interactions or the development of renal failure.
ECG and continuous cardiac monitoring are pivotal.
Laboratory analysis should include a basic metabolic panel and digoxin levels.

"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
Corresponding to the reduced therapeutic use of cardiac glycosides, the number of cardiac glycoside toxicity cases reported to the U.S. Poison Control Centers has decreased over the past 20 years. Nonetheless, digoxin toxicity remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality. 
Chronic toxicity typically results from either drug-drug interactions or the development of acute renal insufficiency.
Pathophysiology
In addition to digoxin, other naturally occurring cardiac glycosides exist, including foxglove, oleander, yellow oleander, red squill, lily of the valley, and dogbane.
While the individual toxins differ slightly among each of these sources, all are cardiac glycosides and, as such, exhibit similar toxicity. Similarly, bufadienolide, a cardiac glycoside, is found in the secretions of toads of the Bufo genus.
Cardiac glycosides inhibit sodium-potassium-ATPase. Consequently, the levels of intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium increase. The increase in intracellular sodium eventually results in an increase in intracellular calcium, ultimately increasing cardiac contractility.  Figure
Digoxin increases the vagal tone and shortens the refractory period of the myocardium, leading to bradycardia and increased automaticity, respectively. 
Diagnostic Considerations
While bradycardia, hypotension, ectopy, and dysrhythmias occur in both acute and chronic toxicity, the two toxicity types generally have distinct clinical presentations.
Acute toxicity is typically characterized by a more abrupt onset of symptoms from a deliberate ingestion. Nausea and vomiting are common, and the patients tend to be younger.
Chronic toxicity is often characterized by a more gradual onset of symptoms, including malaise and generalized weakness.
Premature ventricular contractions are one of the most common dysrhythmias, whereas bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, though rare, is one of the most specific dysrhythmias for digoxin toxicity.  ECG
Atrial tachycardia/atrial flutter with slow variable conduction and atrial fibrillation with a slow regular ventricular rhythm are other arrhythmias that are typical in digoxin toxicity. ECG
Radiographic Evaluation
No specific imaging studies are recommended in cases of digoxin toxicity.
Laboratory Evaluation
Serum potassium concentrations must be obtained in cases of acute toxicity. In this setting, hyperkalemia is a direct marker of toxicity. In a previous study conducted prior to the development of digoxin-immune fragments, no patients with a serum potassium level below 5.0 mEq/L died, whereas all patients with a potassium level above 5.5 mEq/L died. 
Quantitative digoxin concentrations are readily available in most hospital laboratories.
In 2010, the Heart Failure Society of America guidelines stated that the accepted steady-state digoxin concentration of 0.8-2.0 ng/mL should be lowered to 0.7-0.9 ng/mL given the frequent toxicity observed in the “upper therapeutic range”. 
Digoxin concentrations are most accurate when obtained 6 h or more after the last dose in order to avoid predistribution values.
Non-digoxin cardiac glycosides may result in some cross-reactivity with the digoxin assay, but the results can only be used to suggest the presence of a non-digoxin cardiac glycoside. The concentration cannot be quantitatively interpreted.
Therapeutic Considerations
Patients with acute digoxin ingestion presenting within 1 h of exposure may receive oral activated charcoal, unless precluded by waning mental or cardiopulmonary status; multi-dose charcoal administration may even be beneficial given the enterohepatic recycling of cardiac glycosides.
Patients with life-threatening toxicity following acute overdose should be treated with digoxin-Fab.
Following acute ingestion of a cardiac glycoside, empiric treatment is 10 vials IV of digoxin-Fab for adults or 5 vials IV for children.
If the serum digoxin concentration is known, the number of vials can be calculated as follows: # of vials = (serum digoxin concentration in ng/mL × patient weight in kg)/100.
Similarly, if the amount ingested is known, the number of vials can be calculated: # of vials = (0.8 × ingested dose in mg)/0.5.
In cases of acute toxicity, hyperkalemia is best treated with digoxin-Fab.
In cases of chronic toxicity, hyperkalemia can be treated with standard hyperkalemia therapy.
Classically, calcium was contraindicated in the management of digoxin-induced hyperkalemia, although the data supporting this contraindication have been called into question. ",Digoxin

Diazepam is generally not recommended to be given IM due to erratic absorption.
Midazolam: 2-5 mg IV/IM q5-10min
Lorazepam: 1-2 mg IV/IM q20-30min
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV or 3-5 mg/kg IM (until an IV is established) and infusion of 0.75 mg/kg/h
Compared with other treatments, ketamine causes significant dissociative effects and higher risks of intubation.
If chemical restraint is required, also consider alternative causes of encephalopathy. Work-up should include diagnostic labs and/or imaging.
Safety of both the patient and staff is paramount; agitated behavior is a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality.
Withdrawal
Use a standard tool to quantify and track patient (eg, Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment [CIWA]).
For the patient with mild signs and symptoms, treat with benzodiazepines or a return to drinking and likely discharge; consider diazepam, lorazepam, or chlordiazepoxide taper.
For the patient with severe signs and symptoms, treat more aggressively in the inpatient setting.
Delirium tremens can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early.
Diazepam 10 mg IV, increase by 10 mg q10-20min.
Phenobarbital 130-260 mg initial loading, repeat dose q30min.
Propofol 5 μg/kg/min for 5 min, then 5-10 μg/kg/h infusion to desired degree of sedation; typically requires intubation.
If patient is oversedated or if symptoms are refractory, repeat dosing; securing the airway is required.

Key Concepts
Ethanol is involved in nearly half of all trauma-related deaths and is responsible for 2.7 million ED visits each year, at a cost of $8.7 billion.
Signs of ethanol intoxication include ataxia, slurred speech, horizontal nystagmus, and ethanol on the breath.
For stable patients without evidence of trauma, serial clinical evaluation is sufficient.
Upon patient arrival, check patient’s glucose.
Ethanol is typically metabolized at a rate of 15-30 mg/dL/h.
Avoid anchoring on a diagnosis of ethanol intoxication; if patient is not sobering as expected, consider other causes of altered mental status.
Because intoxicated patients are at high risk for trauma, perform a thorough evaluation for underlying injuries.
Base discharge on a clinical evaluation and determination of neurological functioning, not on a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) alone.
Patients should not be responsible for their own transportation.
Alcohol withdrawal
A common mistake is failure to provide adequate sedation.
Sedate the patient such that the patient can maintain the airway; if there are any concerns (drooling, pooling, respiratory depression), provide airway support and mechanical ventilation. High-risk groups are those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and lung disease.
Stages (duration may vary by case)
Mild
Tremor, anxiety, insomnia, sweating, anorexia
Moderate
Autonomic instability (increased heart rate, blood pressure, temperature), visual/tactile/auditory hallucinations
Severe
Severe autonomic instability, extreme agitation, altered sensorium, extreme tremors/seizures (delirium tremens)
Management
Diazepam 10 mg IV, increase by 10 mg q10-20min
Diazepam is generally not recommended to be given IM due to erratic absorption.
Lorazepam 2 mg IV, may double dose every 15 min
Phenobarbital 130-260 mg IV (front loading); then 65-130 mg PRN for mild and 260 mg PRN for severe symptoms every 30 min (symptom-triggered)
Lower the dose if the patient has received benzodiazepines.
Propofol 5 μg/kg/min IV over 5 min followed by 5-10 μg/kg/h
Titrate to desired degree of sedation.
Airway management is required.
Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV or 3-5 mg/kg IM (until an IV is established); may require repeat doses
Dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/h IV infusion
May allow sedation of a patient without impairing ventilation, but prevents withdrawal because dexmedetomidine does not bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or NMDA receptors. Should be considered as a GABA agonist sparing agent.
Key Diagnostic Elements
History of present illness: Time of last drink, quantity and daily allotment, co-ingestants, and onset of symptoms, if any are present. Obtain history directly from the patient; however, also obtain collateral (eg, scene of exposure, environment, medication bottles, containers) and corroborating information from emergency medical services, family, friends, and the electronic medical records. Equally important to ensuring patient safety is identifying whether the exposure was accidental or intentional.
Patients with ethanol intoxication present varied signs and symptoms that can be complicated by co-ingestion of recreational and/or prescription drugs. The following table outlines classic findings that can be more pronounced at higher serum ethanol levels. Table
Because the effects of ethanol are highly individualized, a patient with a high BAC may have little or no signs or symptoms. Table
Ethanol intoxication has many mimics, and acute or chronic ethanol use can exacerbate these mimics. Differentiating serious from benign causes of altered mentation requires the use of sophisticated diagnostic skills and a wide differential.

Treatment
In the treatment of acute intoxication, a thorough assessment is essential, with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care.
To ensure improvement and lack of clinical deterioration, all patients should be on continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring; ideally, vital signs and exam are reassessed at a frequency commensurate with patient stability.
Intoxicated patients require an assessment of airway and respiration:
If obstructed, apneic, or not managing secretions, reposition the patient; if this does not improve symptoms, consider endotracheal intubation.
When evaluating the airway, avoid pharyngeal reflex because this may cause vomiting and resultant aspiration.
Completely undress the patient to ensure that no traumatic injury is missed.
Perform a thorough neurologic exam, including pupillary reflexes, strength, sensation, cranial nerves, coordination, and ambulation.
Provide IV access for altered or sedated patients.
Consider obtaining blood work to assess for other co-ingestants or processes:
Blood gas, CBC, CMP, ethanol level, lactate, and UA with toxin screen
If labs do not otherwise elucidate etiology, consider diagnostic imaging.
Replace micronutrients and electrolytes:
Thiamine 100 mg (as high as 500 mg followed by 100 mg q8h if there is concern for Wernicke encephalopathy or severe thiamine deficiency)
Folate 1 mg
Multivitamin
Magnesium sulfate
Provide gastrointestinal (GI) prophylaxis (PRN for nausea and vomiting):
Ondansetron 4 mg
Ranitidine 50 mg
Pantoprazole 40-80 mg
As patients become clinically sober, reassessment is especially necessary to ensure that alcohol withdrawal is not precipitated.
Disposition
Discharge
Ethanol intoxication is rarely a primary admission diagnosis; however, prolonged time to sobriety will warrant observation in the ED.
Due to varying rates of ethanol metabolism and tolerance, good data do not exist to determine a level that is “safe for discharge.”
American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) guidelines recommend assessment of the patient based on cognitive measures, rather than serum ethanol level. 
Until the patient is sober and can demonstrate capacity, observation is required.
The patient should return to their baseline mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 15), be ambulatory (or at baseline), and tolerate food without difficulty.
Institutions may vary on their policies for determining capacity.
Mental health screening and evaluation to rule out depression, suicidal or homicidal ideation, and other high-risk behaviors are important in treating patients who abuse alcohol.
If a patient has capacity but refuses such an evaluation, they should be discharged against medical advice.
Encourage patients to seek treatment for their alcohol use and safely cessate under the guidance of their physician; return precautions for withdrawal symptoms should also be provided.
Patients treated for ethanol intoxication require alternative transportation; if an inebriated patient attempts to drive, contact authorities. 
Admission
Markedly elevated BAC, signs of cardiopulmonary or airway instability, and lack of cognitive clearing as expected require hospital retention and further work-up. Consider alternate diagnoses, such as occult brain injury, post-ictal state, or encephalopathy.
Concern for alcohol withdrawal, such as CIWA >10 despite appropriate treatment, warrants admission.
Other identified underlying medical conditions such as sepsis, pancreatitis, HE, acute liver or renal failure, or severe electrolyte derangements may warrant admission.",Ethanol Intoxication and Withdrawal
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
Annually, ethanol and its related effects are responsible for around 4.5% of ED visits at a cost of $8 billion to $15.3 billion, with alcohol intoxication being the primary diagnosis in around 1.8% of ED visits by males over 12 y of age. 
Ethyl alcohol (ethanol or common alcohol) is the most common intoxicant used worldwide. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports that 55.6% of people 21-49 y of age ingest alcohol in a given month, and 15.1 million Americans aged 12 y and over meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder, corresponding to 5.6% of the population in this age group. 
Ethanol is a major contributor to acute and chronic morbidity and mortality.
Trauma is the leading cause of death among those from 1 to 40 y of age in the U.S., and ethanol is involved in 30%-50% of all traumatic injuries in the U.S. 
A 2010 NIH report found that alcohol contributed to unintentional injury in 38% of 21- to 24-y-olds presenting to the ED, increasing to 30% and 23% in the 25- to 44-y and 45- to 64-y age groups, respectively. 
The chronic effects of alcohol are seen frequently in the ED, ranging from complications due to liver failure, management of withdrawal symptoms, nutritional deficiencies, depression, and suicide, among others. Rare is the ED shift that does not involve the care of a patient affected by alcohol.
Pathophysiology
Ethanol is found in alcoholic beverages, with ~14 g of ethanol in each of the following: 12 oz of 5% beer, 5 oz of 12% wine, and 1.5 oz of 40% liquor. Varying amounts of ethanol are found in everyday products such as mouthwash, perfumes, and medications.
One “drink” raises the BAC by approximately 20-25 mg/dL (adult) or 100 mg/dL (15-kg child).
Ethanol is rapidly absorbed through any mucosal surface; typically, it is orally ingested and then absorbed in the stomach. However, especially in youth, EDs see rectal (“butt shots”) or vaginal (“vodka tampons”) administration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately 1 h post-ingestion.
Central nervous system (CNS) depression occurs primarily via GABA activation and NMDA inhibition, leading to sedation, poor judgment, ataxia, and slurred speech. Long-term use causes downregulation of GABA receptors and upregulation of NMDA receptors, both contributing to dependence and subsequent withdrawal symptoms.
Many pharmacology texts cite a median lethal dose (LD50) of 400-500 mg/dL (20-40 drinks), typically by respiratory depression.  The lethal dose is highly variable, depending on patient weight, ingestion period, co-ingestants, and tolerance.
Ingestion of ethanol with cocaine forms cocaethylene during hepatic metabolism, leading to a longer euphoric effect while increasing the cardiotoxic effects of cocaine. 
Chronic effects of ethanol include hepatocyte destruction and liver scarring, leading to congestive hepatopathy and failure of liver synthetic function; sequelae of this include GI scarring and bleeding, macrocytic anemia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and a depressed immune system.
Ethanol elimination is mainly via liver metabolism (80%-90%) through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde (the cause of the “hangover”) via alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetate (the cause of stored calories) via aldehyde dehydrogenase. This second step is blocked by disulfiram or other medications causing the disulfiram reaction.
Ethanol is initially eliminated via first-order kinetics, then, as NAD+ is consumed, by zero-order kinetics, typically at 7-10 g of alcohol per hour, leading to a BAC that decreases at a rate of around 15-30 mg/dL/h (higher in chronic alcoholics), the equivalent of roughly 1 “drink” per hour. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Unfortunately, there is no pathognomonic clinical presentation for the patient suffering from acute or chronic effects of alcohol use and abuse. Ethanol use is ubiquitous and highly correlated with patients presenting to the ED. A low threshold to broaden the differential must be maintained in any patient presenting with possible intoxication, including hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, traumatic brain injury, seizure, GI bleed, infection/sepsis, encephalopathy (Wernicke, hepatic, encephalitis, uremic), stroke, or co-ingestion of other drugs or other alcohols (methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropanol).
If the history, exam, work-up, or expected clinical course does not fit, the differential must be broadened.
Acute ethanol intoxication findings are related to CNS depressive effects.
These include ataxic gait, slurred speech, hyporeflexia, delayed reaction time, diplopia, and horizontal nystagmus. Sensitivity for horizontal gaze nystagmus is around 70%, and that of ethanol on the breath is around 80%, with a 7% false-positive rate.  Co-ingestion with opiates should be considered if pupils are pinpoint.
Chronic ethanol manifestations are related to hepatotoxic effects: 
Asterixis: Hand flap seen with CNS disinhibition; also seen with uremia.
Jaundice: Cutaneous finding seen when bilirubin is >2-3 mg/dL.
Spider angiomata: 50% sensitive and 88% specific for advanced liver disease.
Terry’s nails: 43% sensitive and 98% specific for advanced liver disease.
Abdominal distention and fluid wave may be seen if ascites is present.
In the uncomplicated patient, labs are not routinely obtained or indicated, except for blood glucose; however, if obtained, labs may demonstrate varying abnormalities based on acute vs. chronic ethanol exposure.
Acute exposure
Mild aspartate aminotransferase (AST)- and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)-predominant transaminitis is common due to acute ischemic and hypoxic hepatocyte damage; classically, AST > alanine aminotransferase and GGT > alkaline phosphatase.
Osmolar gap (>10 mOsm/kg) and mild metabolic acidosis are common with alcoholic ketosis; significant acidosis or a high anion gap should warrant work-up for lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or other toxic alcohol ingestion. 
Chronic exposure
AST-predominant transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia.
Macrocytosis and thrombocytopenia.
Hyponatremia secondary to beer potomania.
Elevated lipase secondary to alcoholic pancreatitis.
Elevated venous ammonia levels can be a marker for hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, elevated venous ammonia has variable sensitivity and specificity for HE. 
Urine ethyl glucuronide can detect ethanol use days after cessation.
Therapeutic Considerations
Intoxication
Most U.S. states define “legally intoxicated” (based on laws related to driving motor vehicles) as a BAC >80 mg/dL, although functional impairment can vary widely; ethanol typically affects patients of lower weight and/or female gender, those with alcohol naivety or a lack of food consumption prior to alcohol use, and those who have co-ingested depressants or sedatives.
Patients brought to the ED for acute ethanol intoxication should undergo a thorough history and physical exam to assess for other causes of altered sensorium, such as trauma or co-ingestants.
Ethanol can blunt gluconeogenesis during metabolism in the liver (compounded by poor baseline nutrition among chronic alcoholics), and the low body stores of glycogen can result in hypoglycemia; therefore, a blood glucose level should always be obtained. Treatment should begin with oral D50W (25 g) unless it is precluded by the patient’s mental status; otherwise, give IV D50W (25 g). For recurrent hypoglycemia and to prevent vein necrosis caused by high-volume administration of D50W, administer infusion of D25W or D10W.
Ethanol, a diuretic, increases plasma osmolality and inhibits vasopressin, both of which contribute to dehydration; if the patient appears dehydrated, begin crystalloids at 1 L of 0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus followed by a maintenance rate of dextrose and balanced salt solution.
Ethanol can be a gastric irritant inducing emesis; symptomatic management includes the use of antiemetics (eg, ondansetron 4 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg) and gastric prophylaxis (eg, ranitidine 150 mg or pantoprazole 40 mg).
Chronic ethanol abuse poses a higher risk for Wernicke encephalopathy with severe thiamine deficiency; if suspected, empiric therapy consists of thiamine 500 mg IV bolus q8h for 3 d, followed by 200 mg IV q24h × 3 d, then 100 mg PO q8h, folic acid 1 mg, and a multivitamin and electrolyte replacement. Concern for precipitation of Wernicke encephalopathy should not delay glucose administration. This risk is largely based on animal studies and has not been confirmed in the medical literature.  Nutrient correction can be safely addressed once the patient is normoglycemic.
No currently approved medications in the U.S. will hasten sobriety in the patient with ethanol intoxication; they only ameliorate the effects of ethanol. However, such a medication (metadoxine) has been approved overseas and may eventually be used in the U.S.
A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study in Russia found that ~1 g IV metadoxine (a vitamin B6 salt) decreased the half-life of ethanol from 6.7 h to 5.4 h and led to a shorter recovery time (0.95 h vs. 2.3 h) in acute alcohol intoxication. 
U.S. phase-2 clinical trials were performed in 2015, but development has since stalled. Metadoxine is currently available in China, India, and Mexico, among others, for treatment of acute alcohol intoxication.
Agitation
Patient and staff safety is paramount. Immediate control of the agitated patient is essential and is a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality; chemical sedation has a strong association with underlying serious illness. 
All patients sedated or restrained should be placed on continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring. The medications listed below can be used alone or in combination; however, all carry a risk of oversedation, respiratory depression, dysrhythmia, and death, as well as other side effects.
Benzodiazepines (preferred, but may need higher doses if active withdrawal occurs)
Diazepam: 5-20 mg IV q20-30 min
Diazepam is generally not recommended to be given IM due to erratic absorption.
Longer acting and can cause prolonged oversedation.
Midazolam: 2-5 mg IV/IM q5-10min
Quick onset and can temporize patient for further work-up.
Lorazepam: 1-2 mg IV/IM q20-30min
Safer in the elderly because of its short half-life.
NMDA receptor antagonist
Ketamine: 1-4 mg/kg IV/IM; onset of 2 min, half-life of 2 h
Compared to other treatments, causes significant dissociative effects and slightly higher risks of intubation.
Ketamine infusion (0.75-1.6 mg/kg/h) can be considered for benzodiazepine-resistant sedation. 
Withdrawal
Ethanol withdrawal may occur at any blood ethanol concentration.
Signs of withdrawal reflect exaggerated sympathomimetic activity.
Persistent and continued ethanol consumption results in a decrease in GABA transmission, GABAergic receptor concentrations, and conformational changes in GABAergic receptors to maintain homeostasis in the nervous system.
Sudden cessation of ethanol consumption results in a relative increase in excitatory neurotransmission in the brain relative to the usual inhibition of ethanol and GABA. Figure
The definition of ethanol withdrawal requires a sudden cessation (or marked decrease) of heavy or prolonged consumption, and 2 or more of the following symptoms hours to days after cessation that are not the result of another medical condition:
Autonomic instability (tachycardia, diaphoresis, hypertension, elevated body temperature)
Increased hand tremor
Insomnia
Nausea/vomiting
Transient hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile)
Psychomotor agitation
Anxiety
Seizure
Classically, hand or other body tremors (“rum fits”) have been reported within 4-6 h of ethanol cessation, with other symptoms manifesting 1 d or more later. Figure 1 presents a continuum of ethanol withdrawal symptoms.
The exact timing and presentation of withdrawal symptoms are highly variable; some patients may present with seizure as a first symptom and within a few hours of ethanol cessation. Not all patients present in the same manner with ethanol withdrawal.
The most severe form of ethanol withdrawal is delirium tremens, defined as an alteration in a patient’s ability to interact with their environment (reduced awareness of surroundings) and/or cognitive/perceptual disturbances that are not accounted for by other medical or psychiatric conditions (ie, dementia).
Delirium tremens often waxes and wanes during the course of the day.
A number of different scoring systems have been developed to measure ethanol withdrawal severity (CIWA, Severity of Ethanol Withdrawal Score [SEWS]) or risk for ethanol withdrawal (Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Scale [PAWS]).
It is imperative to appropriately assess for alternative explanations for vital sign aberrations and/or symptoms in all patients and to not prematurely ascribe these symptoms to ethanol withdrawal because of an elevated score on one of these scales. Figure
The most common mistake is failure to provide adequate sedation, which results in safety issues for patients and staff.
Additional errors include treating to a specific CIWA or other scoring system “score” rather than treating patients and fixed dosing of sedatives. This may result in some patients being undertreated for withdrawal symptoms.
The goals of care are to sedate the patient, normalize vital signs, and minimize patient discomfort or tremor, with the patient protecting their own airway and breathing on their own; however, if there is concern, airway support and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
Patients with COPD, OSA, or other lung disease may not be able to maintain their airway with the aggressive sedation required for appropriate treatment of withdrawal.
Sedatives
Benzodiazepines
Diazepam 10 mg IV, increase by 10 mg every 10-20 min
Lorazepam 2 mg IV, with double dose every 15 min up to 20 mg
Barbiturates
Phenobarbital 130-260 mg initial loading (depending on whether the patient has previously received benzodiazepines), then 65-130 mg PRN for mild and 260 mg for severe symptoms every 30 min. Severe withdrawal may require airway management.
Hypnotica alkylphenol derivative
Propofol 5 μg/kg/min for 5 min, then 5-10 μg/kg/h infusion to desired degree of sedation. Airway management is required.
NMDA receptor antagonist
Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV or 3-5 mg/kg IM until IV is established, then infusion of 0.5-0.75 mg/kg/h, can increase to 1.6 mg/kg/h. 
Selective α2-agonist
Dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/h IV
Refractory (Resistant) Alcohol Withdrawal (RAW)
A subset of patients with severe alcohol withdrawal do not respond to benzodiazepine treatment, despite escalating doses.
RAW is associated with higher incidences of mechanical ventilation, nosocomial pneumonia, and longer ICU stay.
Definitions of RAW have included the following:
Lorazepam dose >10 mg in 1 h or 40 mg in 4 h
Diazepam dose >200 mg within 3 h
Alternatives to benzodiazepines should be considered early in patients with RAW. There is theoretical and clinical benefit to using GABAergic modulators that act at a different site on the GABA receptor. Figure
Phenobarbital and propofol, both GABAergic agents, have receptor sites in the channel area of the GABA receptor, whereas benzodiazepines act on the surface of the receptor. Switching therapy to phenobarbital and propofol in RAW or early use in patients requiring rapid sequence intubation for severe agitation is preferred.
Dexmedetomidine should be considered as a medication used to spare GABA agonists. Dexmedetomidine will not prevent withdrawal because dexmedetomidine does not bind to GABA or NMDA receptors. It is sedating and typically does not cause respiratory depression; thus, it offers some benefits in these cases.
Ketamine bolus and infusions are gaining interest in these cases as NMDA (glutamate) antagonists. Ketamine decreases NMDA activity, whereas GABA drugs (benzodiazepines, ethanol, barbiturates, propofol) increase GABA activity. The effect is similar to that of balancing a teeter-totter; step on the NMDA receptor with ketamine and raise the GABA with barbiturates. Figure
Trauma
Concomitant intoxication and trauma is not uncommon; a high degree of suspicion is key to ensuring that an occult injury is not missed.
Intoxicated patients are a major source of resource utilization in the ED; however, they are at high risk for morbidity, mortality, and potential litigation.
ATLS primary and secondary surveys should always be performed; special considerations include the following:
History and physical exam can be difficult in intoxicated patients, who are often obtunded, unreliable, or uncooperative; whenever possible, it is important to obtain additional information from emergency medical services and witnesses and, in particular, to obtain information regarding possible co-ingestions. The need for imaging can be obvious; however, many decision tools (NEXUS, New Orleans, ACEP) exist in which intoxication is a variable to warrant the consideration of imaging.
Traumatic brain injury
Many head imaging decision tools suggest CT for patients with GCS <15 or if intoxicated with loss of consciousness or amnesia.
A 2013 prospective cohort study of 283 patients with minor head injury (excluding major head trauma and GCS <13) and serum ethanol >80 mg/dL found that 23 (8%) had a clinically significant intracranial injury. Interestingly, 4/23 would have been ruled out by NEXUS criteria, and 7/23 would have been ruled out by Canadian criteria. The New Orleans criteria use intoxication as an independent variable for CT imaging. Loss of consciousness and headache were the two variables most commonly associated with a positive finding. Only one patient required neurosurgical intervention, and he had a GCS of 15 upon arrival at the ED. 
Another common approach is using serial evaluation, including vital signs, neurologic status, and level of consciousness, to guide imaging in the absence of other indications. A 2017 retrospective review at 2 trauma centers of 5,900 inebriated trauma patients who underwent immediate vs. delayed CT imaging found a difference of only 1 patient who required (non-emergency) neurosurgical intervention. 
Cervical spine injury
Early c-spine clearance is suggested; this can be done with CT followed by serial exams, repeating the complete exam once the patient is sober.
A 2017 prospective study of over 10,000 patients with blunt trauma at 17 level I and II trauma centers demonstrated that negative c-spine CT had a 99.9% negative predictive value (NPV) for clinically significant spinal injury; the c-collar time was prolonged among the intoxicated group at 8 h vs. 2 h. 
Similar findings in a single-center prospective study of 1,600 patients sustaining blunt trauma found that CT had a 99% NPV for all injuries and 99.8% NPV for unstable injuries; the c-collar time was also prolonged in the intoxicated group at 15.1 h vs. 3.7 h. 
Prolonged c-collar use is associated with morbidity, including pressure ulcers, aspiration risk, increased intracranial pressure, difficulty with line placement and intubation, and others.
Once traumatic injuries are excluded, patients warrant observation and clinical monitoring for sobriety and capacity.
If CNS depression is not improving or is worsening, a broader differential must be considered.
Unique Considerations
Ethanol abuse inherently increases the risk of certain clinical conditions, such as alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA), GI hemorrhage, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and sepsis.
Alcoholic Ketoacidosis
Ethanol may cause an anion gap (~20) metabolic acidosis precipitated by acute alcohol abstinence, starvation, or illness/sepsis.
Lipolysis during the starvation state leads to ketone body (primarily β-hydroxybutyrate) formation and catecholamine stimulation.
AKA will have elevated ketones and normal to slightly elevated glucose levels.
Diagnosis is based on moderate-range glucose (not high, as in diabetic ketoacidosis), heavy drinking followed by cessation or vomiting, present anion gap, positive ketones (urine nitroprusside assay can be negative initially), altered mentation with acidosis, and no other explanation.
Treatment largely consists of supportive care with crystalloid, dextrose, and thiamine.
GI Hemorrhage
Unless severe, gastritis typically does not cause significant GI bleeding, but chronic heavy alcoholics are at risk for the development of hepatic disease and varices, which can result in altered mentation and acute blood loss.
Diagnosis: Hematemesis, coffee ground emesis, hematochezia, melena; anemia may not be seen on initial labs or stool guaiac.
Treatment: ABC stabilization; type and screen for transfusion if unstable or unresponsive to fluid resuscitation; proton pump inhibition (eg, pantoprazole 80 mg IV followed by 8 mg/h infusion), octreotide 50 μg IV bolus followed by 25 μg/h infusion and antibiotic prophylaxis (eg, ceftriaxone 1 g q24h) for suspected variceal bleed. Consider tranexamic acid (eg, 1 g loading followed by 3 g over 24 h), although data on upper and lower GI bleed outcomes with tranexamic acid have not been robust. 
All patients with an acute GI bleed require admission, often to a higher level of care (intermediate or intensive care unit) with GI and/or surgical consultation.
Thiamine Deficiency
Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute neurological syndrome characterized by the classic triad of confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia (nystagmus with a lateral rectus palsy). 
Korsakoff syndrome (80% of cases in patients with chronic and recurrent Wernicke encephalopathy) is an amnestic disorder characterized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation, and lack of insight into condition.
Korsakoff syndrome may also occur without ethanol ingestion, in cases such as severe malnutrition (eating disorders, prolonged vomiting, chemotherapy, extreme morning sickness) where thiamine deficiency is present. 
Wernicke encephalopathy may occur with or without concomitant Korsakoff syndrome.
Treatment for both conditions is thiamine repletion, typically 500 mg IV q8h or 3 d, then 200 mg IV q2h for 3 d, followed by 100 mg q8h for severe symptoms.
Sepsis
There is a high risk of sepsis in patients with acute and chronic ethanol use; if fever is present, a full diagnostic work-up should be pursued unless a clear source is identified.",Ethanol Intoxication and Withdrawal
"Rapid Access- Heavy Metals
Approach to the Critical Patient
The mainstay in any acute poisoning is a thorough assessment with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care.
Obtaining an abdominal radiograph (KUB) early can aid in determining the presence of radio-opaque substances in the GI tract of a patient with suspected ingestion of a heavy metal.
Decontamination in the form of whole bowel irrigation should be considered for ingested heavy metals, particularly if there are radio-opaque substances visualized on the KUB.
For suspicion of lead-induced encephalopathy, initiate procedures for managing increased intracranial pressure.
Patients will require transfer to a facility that has dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite or BAL) and calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) available.
The patient with severe pneumonitis from the inhalation of aerosolized elemental mercury may require intubation and oxygen supplementation.
For inorganic arsenic and mercury, treat hypotension and shock with IV crystalloid and vasopressors as needed.
Avoid any xenobiotics that may prolong the QT interval if acute inorganic arsenic is suspected.
For arsine poisoning, a type and crossmatch should be ordered given the likelihood that emergent transfusion will be needed.
Audio Board Review EM:RAP Audio
Key Concepts
Acute heavy metal poisonings are rare occurrences, and clinical presentation is highly dependent on both the metal/metalloid involved and the chemical form (organic, inorganic, etc.) of the metal/metalloid.
Acute lead poisoning in pediatric patients is more likely to present with encephalopathy than in adult patients. Acute lead poisoning in adults is more commonly associated with occupational exposure. Lead is not caustic to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (as is observed with arsenic and mercury), so lead poisoning may present more insidiously.
Both inorganic arsenic and mercury should be considered in the differential for the patient who presents shortly after ingestion with acute onset of severe “gastroenteritis” with shock, because these metals are corrosive to the GI tract.
Unlike most other heavy metals, arsenic may cause ventricular dysrhythmias and torsades de pointes.
Arsine exposure (a gaseous form of arsenic) results in massive hemolysis within a few hours of exposure.
Acute pulmonary toxicity occurs after inhalation exposure of aerosolized elemental mercury.
Treatment for acute intoxication from a heavy metal should be instituted prior to laboratory confirmation. Most hospitals will not be able to perform heavy metals laboratory analysis on site and will need to “send out” the labs.
Most states have specific reporting requirements for elevated lead levels. Be aware of your state’s reporting requirements.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Clinical presentation is dependent on the type of metal/metalloid and the route of exposure.
A thorough poisoning history includes time, route, and quantity of exposure, coingestants, and onset of symptoms. The history should be obtained directly from the patient; however, collateral information (eg, medication bottles, herbal supplements, nutraceuticals) must also be obtained from emergency medical services, family, friends, and the electronic medical record.
Equally important is identifying whether the exposure is accidental or intentional.
Remember to query and document any possible occupational exposures. For children with lead exposure, the occupational history of the parents may be an important clue to the exposure.
Many states have a reporting system with their Department of Health for elevated lead levels, particularly for pediatric exposures. Some states have mandatory reporting (check your state’s requirements).
Lead Acute
Exposure in children is associated with reduced intelligence and may worsen neurobehavioral issues; altered mental status, colicky abdominal pain, and anemia may be observed.
Adults are more likely to manifest with motor neuropathy (eg, wrist or foot drop); hypertension, anemia, and abdominal pain can also predominate.
Subacute
Symptoms are nonspecific and may only involve neuropsychiatric manifestations such as irritability, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue.
Subacute lead exposure is more commonly associated with constipation than diarrhea.
Arsenic
The ingestion of an arsenic-containing rodenticide may present with acute vomiting, “rice water” stools, rapid progression to shock, and dysrhythmias, followed by the development of sensorimotor neuropathy.
Mercury
Inhalation exposure can lead to rapid progression of respiratory distress and failure.
The patient may present as a “suicidal chemist” who arrives to the emergency department in shock with vomiting and rapid progression to renal failure.
Laboratory/Radiographic Evaluation
Concern for heavy metal poisoning merits some laboratory analysis: complete blood count and metabolic panel, as well as urinalysis.
A KUB can aid in identifying radio-opaque substances in the GI tract.
Most testing for the heavy metal of interest is a “send out” test.
Lead
This is best measured by a whole blood lead level.
Arsenic
A 12-lead electrocardiogram should be obtained to assess for prolongation of the QT interval in the setting of acute inorganic arsenic poisoning because arsenic is associated with torsades de pointes.
For arsine exposures, order a type with a crossmatch and hemolysis labs. If the peripheral blood smear shows signs of hemolysis, then serial hemoglobin levels should be monitored.
Inorganic arsenic is best examined by the collection and analysis of a 24-h urine sample. However, the types of arsenic found in the urine must be speciated to ensure that the type of arsenic that is being detected is inorganic arsenic. Organic arsenic is not toxic but may be found in the urine due to a diet containing fish and seafood.
Mercury
Chest radiograph should be obtained for elemental mercury inhalation exposure.
Inorganic mercury is also best measured with a 24-h urine sample. Organic mercury is better measured by a blood mercury level.
Treatment
Initial management is ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure).
All patients should have intravenous access, cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry.
Patients with respiratory distress due to pneumonitis from agents such as inhalational elemental mercury poisoning require intubation and ventilation.
For shock states, initiate resuscitation with intravenous crystalloid infusion and initiate vasopressors as needed.
Whole bowel irrigation (polyethylene glycol 1-2 L/h via gastric tube for adults, 35 mL/kg/h for children) is recommended for radio-opaque substances in the GI tract.
Activated charcoal does not bind to heavy metals and will not prevent absorption. Activated charcoal is not generally recommended for heavy metal ingestions.
Blood transfusion should be initiated for arsine-induced hemolysis.
There is no antidotal therapy for heavy metal poisoning. Chelators are compounds that bind with the heavy metal to enhance elimination in the urine.
Chelation therapy should be guided in consultation with the local poison control center and/or medical toxicologist. Most chelators are not readily available at hospitals or pharmacies.
Acute inorganic arsenic and inorganic mercury: dimercaprol (BAL) via intramuscular injection may be used as a chelator.
Lead: BAL intramuscularly in conjunction with calcium disodium EDTA intravenously are used for encephalopathy. Oral succimer (meso-2,3-dimercapto-succinic acid or DMSA) may be used as an alternative chelator for patients who are not acutely ill.
Oral 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate (DMPS) may be used in countries outside of the U.S. because DMPS is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Background
Metals with a high density or atomic weight are considered heavy metals. Some heavy metals, in small amounts, are essential nutrients. However, in large quantities, they can be toxic.
Epidemiology
Lead exposure in children in the U.S. has significantly declined following the elimination of lead from paint and gasoline. However, there are many other sources of exposures in children including folk medicines, ayurvedic preparations, and imported products.  In one study, risk factors found in children with blood lead levels >45 μg/dL in New York City included lead paint hazards in the home (82%), behavioral risk factors (mouthing, chewing, or eating non-food items), and use of imported products (26%) (food, pottery, cosmetics, and medicines). 
The traditional sources of lead exposure in children include ingestion or inhalation of the dust/flakes of aged house paint. The paint particles may be incorporated into the soil around the house and serve as a source due to the hand-mouth behavior of children.
Lead poisoning in adults is classically related to occupational exposures, usually inhalation or ingestion. Other sources of exposures in adults include leaded ceramics, bootleg moonshine, firearm use, and automotive repair work.
Lead exposure may occur in the occupational setting, and the dust from the contaminated work clothes may be brought into the home. Restoration of older buildings that contain lead paint should include abatement procedures to reduce the amount of lead exposure to workers.
While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set the reference level for whole blood lead at 5 μg/dL, there may be no lower limit threshold for adverse effects in children. One study reported the analysis of data pooled from seven cohort studies (1,333 children) and found lead-related intellectual deficits occurring in children whose maximal blood lead levels were <7.5 μg/dL. The deficits appeared to be greater in the cohorts with lower blood lead levels. 
Acute heavy metal poisoning from inorganic arsenic and inorganic mercury are rare events.
Arsenic was once known as the “inheritance powder” given that the powder is tasteless and odorless, leading some to use arsenic when committing intentional harm against other humans. The most common exposure to arsenic is through drinking water. The contamination occurs due to the natural leaching of arsenic into shallow aquifers. Chronic arsenic poisoning from exposure to contaminated groundwater is a serious public threat in many countries.  Sources of arsenic include insecticides, herbicides (monosodium methyl arsonate), and medicinal use (arsenic trioxide). Arsenic is occasionally also found in herbal and ayurvedic products. 
Mercury is a naturally occurring metal that has three primary forms, each with its own potential routes of exposure. In the U.S., mercury use in pharmaceuticals and biocides has significantly declined, so exposure has declined. Environmental disasters have occurred in the past following the contamination of water sources with mercury. Industrial use continues, so occupational exposures may occur. Artisanal gold production may result in exposure to mercurial fumes.  Exposure to mercury in the U.S. usually derives from fish consumption and dental amalgams. Herbal and ayurvedic products and imported skin lightening creams may also contain mercury.  Case reports of such mercury exposures describe the rarity of unintentional exposures to mercury.
Pathophysiology
Lead
Lead may be absorbed via ingestion or inhalation. Children have higher absorption rates of lead when ingested compared to adults.
Lead is a divalent cation metal that has a strong affinity for sulfhydryl groups, which exist in enzymes, proteins, and receptors. Given that lead is similar to calcium, it interferes with calcium-dependent processes including neurotransmitter release and function, particularly in the hippocampus. The effects of lead on synaptic development could have long-term impairments. 
Lead inhibits several enzymes in heme synthesis, particularly delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase. Microcytic anemia may occur in addition to basophilic stippling due to clumping of degraded RNA. Hemolysis may also occur.
Lead may result in hypertension, likely due to multiple mechanisms including effects on calcium modulation in vascular smooth muscle cells. In adults, lead poisoning results in gametotoxic effects, which lower sperm counts.
Arsenic
Arsenic is a metalloid that exists in inorganic and organic forms. The organic form, arsenobetaine, is found in seafood and has limited clinical toxicity. Inorganic arsenic is available in trivalent and pentavalent forms. Arsine is formed when arsenic is exposed to an acid. Arsine is a non-irritating but highly toxic gas with a mild garlicky odor.
The trivalent forms of arsenic inhibit multiple biochemical enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thiolase, glutathione synthetase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, and glutathione reductase. Many of these enzymes are inhibited by arsenic binding to sulfhydryl groups. This inhibition decreases the activity of the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, and protection from oxidative stress. 
Pentavalent forms of arsenic can be reduced to trivalent forms of arsenic. Due to the valence of pentavalent arsenic, it resembles phosphorus and may substitute as an inorganic phosphorus, reducing the effectiveness of ATP production. 
Cardiotoxicity from arsenic is related to the blockade of delayed rectifier potassium channels. Ventricular dysrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, may occur. Torsades de pointes has been reported even with therapeutic dosing of arsenic trioxide used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia. 
Peripheral neuropathy associated with arsenic may occur after either acute or chronic exposures. While the mechanism is unclear, the theory is that arsenic interferes with cytoskeletal proteins. 
Arsenic is a carcinogen with evidence for causing lung, skin, and bladder cancers. Mechanisms may include arsenic-related promotion of oxidative stress as well as disrupted cell signaling, such as in the epidermal growth factor receptor. 
Mercury
Mercury has three primary clinical forms, each chemical form having its own unique type of toxicity.
Elemental mercury is the form that most people identify as mercury. It is the dense, silvery, white form that is a liquid at room temperature. Drops of elemental mercury will maintain a somewhat spherical shape and will merge with other droplets. The droplets tend to maintain their surface tension in the shape of a “ball,” which serves as an attractant. Elemental mercury was previously used in thermometers and sphygmomanometers. This form is present in mercury amalgams and gold ore. 
Toxicity from elemental mercury occurs from inhalation of the mercury vapor, whether from heating or vacuuming. While there is exposure to mercury vapor from amalgams, there is little data to support systemic toxicity.  Cases of intentional or occupational subcutaneous or intravenous injection of elemental mercury have been reported. 
Toxicity from mercury likely stems from its avid binding to sulfhydryl groups, which results in the disruption of multiple enzymes in the body. This feature also allows the attachment of the mercury compounds to the neuroglia and neurons. Mercury in the brain may also produce reactive oxygen species while reducing glutathione, which acts as the major antioxidant.  An animal model of inorganic mercury poisoning suggested that glutathione is a protective factor against severe renal injury, although the mice that were metallothionein-depleted had more severe outcomes following glutathione depletion than the wild type mice with glutathione depletion. 
Inorganic mercury usually comes in a salt form and historically was used in teething powders, worming lozenges, and disinfectants. Inorganic mercurials are found in creams used as cosmetic skin-lightening products. Inorganic mercury replaces the copper needed for tyrosinase activity, which is required for melanin production. 
Organic mercurials include methyl mercury and ethyl mercury. These compounds are found in fish. Methyl mercury is a known teratogen and potent neurotoxicant. Methyl mercury was responsible for outbreaks of severe neurotoxicity and teratogenicity in Minamata Bay, Japan, in the 1950s-60s and for contaminated grain in Iraq in the early 1980s. Ethyl mercury (thimerosal) has been used in vaccines, which has resulted in controversy. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Acute lead poisoning in the adult patient may exhibit abdominal pain, anemia, hypertension, and motor neuropathy (wrist or foot drop). Adults rarely exhibit the encephalopathy that is seen in children.
Pediatric lead poisoning patients are more likely to exhibit the gastrointestinal effects of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and encephalopathy from increased intracranial pressure. The absence of obvious clinical findings in children does not necessarily mean that there is no intellectual or behavioral impairment from their lead exposure.
Acute arsenic poisoning may present with symptoms within minutes to hours of ingestion. The initial symptoms include nausea, vomiting, with watery “rice water” diarrhea. Due to damage of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, GI bleeding may occur. Encephalopathy occurs with other end-organ effects including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and ventricular dysrhythmias.  Pancytopenia and sensorimotor neuropathy may develop within 1 wk of acute poisoning. The neuropathy may mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome. The peripheral neuropathy may last for years. 
Chronic arsenicosis may result in multisystem effects. Dermatologic findings include keratosis and melanosis. Anemia, sensory neuropathy, and malignancies of the skin, lung, bladder, and kidney occur. Peripheral vascular disease known as “blackfoot disease” with resulting gangrene of the foot is associated with chronic arsenic exposure. 
Chronic exposure is also proposed to contribute to diseases of the endothelium including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and microvascular disease. The mechanism is thought to be related to the activation of reactive oxygen species. 
The toxicity of mercury depends on the form of the mercury.
Elemental mercury exposure is primarily inhalational because the mercury is vaporized. Within hours of exposure, the patient will exhibit fever, chills, cough, and dyspnea. This may progress rapidly to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and ventilation. 
When inorganic mercurial salts are ingested, the first clinical signs are acute gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding. These patients manifest with acute shock and develop rapidly progressive renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis.
The prototype of the organic mercurials is methylmercury, which is a potent neurotoxicant. A representative illustration of the potency and the delay in neurotoxicity is demonstrated in a case report of a researcher who spilled several drops of dimethylmercury onto the dorsum of her gloved hand. Her first exposure was in August. In January of the following year, she experienced 5 d of progressive neurological symptoms. She received chelation with oral succimer given the significantly elevated whole blood levels of mercury, yet had progression of her neurologic impairment. Despite 3 mo of aggressive therapy, her prognosis was dismal and her advance directives were followed. Her autopsy demonstrated thinning of the cerebral cortex, atrophy of the cerebellum, extensive neural loss, and extremely high tissue levels of mercury in the frontal lobe and visual cortex. 
Radiographic Evaluation
Most heavy metals are radio-opaque if taken in a concentrated formulation. Obtaining a KUB to determine the presence of radio-opaque foreign bodies may guide the need to perform whole bowel irrigation for removal of the radio-opaque foreign bodies.
Radiographs of long bones in children with lead toxicity may demonstrate increased densities of the metaphysis. This increased radiodensity represents impaired bone growth and deposition of calcium, not the deposition of the lead. However, radiographs are not recommended as part of lead surveillance.
Elemental mercury inhalation exposures will demonstrate radiographic findings of acute pneumonitis in an interstitial pattern.
Injected elemental mercury may be demonstrated by radiograph in the subcutaneous tissues. The rare intravenous administration of elemental mercury will result in a chest radiograph with multiple, minute mercurial pulmonary emboli. 
Laboratory Evaluation
Heavy metal “screens” are rarely helpful to the clinician. The study of choice is dependent on the metal of interest. In addition, the containers used to collect or store the samples for testing must be free of contamination from any of the metals.
Lead is best measured as the whole blood lead level. Urine lead is not considered a reference level.
24-h urine samples are used to measure inorganic arsenic; however, the test must specify speciation of the arsenic to distinguish between organic and inorganic. Organic arsenic may be commonly found in urine arsenic studies and is usually related to the diet of the patient.
Inorganic mercury is also best measured by a 24-h urine sample. Organic mercury is better suited to measurements of whole blood because organic mercury is not eliminated via the urine.
Therapeutic Considerations
The administration of chelation to patients with heavy metal toxicity should be discussed with a medical toxicologist to determine the risk/benefit for the patient.
BAL was originally developed as a therapy for exposure to Lewisite, a topical arsenic. BAL was associated with increased urinary excretion of arsenic after treatment of patients with arsenical dermatitis. A very limited number of studies in humans have been conducted to determine efficacy. BAL may increase the distribution of mercury and arsenic to the brain given its mobilization effects and redistribution abilities. 
BAL intramuscularly with IV calcium disodium EDTA is used for severe lead poisoning.
Succimer, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a water-soluble version of BAL that enhances the urine elimination of lead, inorganic arsenic, and mercury. DMSA has fewer side effects than BAL.
A landmark study in 2001 demonstrated that chelation in children who had blood lead levels between 20-44 μg/dL had a reduction in whole blood lead levels; however, there was no improvement on tests for cognition, behavior, or neuropsychological functioning. 
Animal data supporting the use of DMSA for inorganic arsenic and inorganic mercury suggest that administration must occur rapidly (within min to h after exposure) for the most benefit. 
DMPS has been studied in a small number of patients with chronic arsenicosis due to the high levels of arsenic in their drinking water. Those patients showed improvement in their clinical scores of weakness and pigmentation. Urinary excretion of arsenic increased after the administration of DMPS. The study was limited by many subjective endpoints and because the pathology findings of the skin biopsy did not correspond with the subjective findings. 
Very limited data exist for the use of a chelator as a treatment in arsine exposure and poisoning. Care is supportive with transfusion as needed for hemolysis. Renal failure may occur due to hemoglobinuria.
Many patients continue to have central nervous system effects from acute and chronic heavy metal poisonings for years after exposure.
Inhalational mercury-poisoned patients may demonstrate long-term restrictive lung disease.
Prevention
In children, reducing the exposure to lead is the paramount focus of prevention. There is no apparent threshold below which lead does not exert negative effects on a child and his/her development. One randomized residential lead hazard intervention study demonstrated a reduction in blood lead levels in children, although no improvements were seen in neurobehavioral domains.  Chelation may lower lead levels but may not change long-term outcomes. Having a level of suspicion in high-risk populations may result in additional screening that may reduce long-term exposure.",Heavy Metals
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
The mainstay in any acute poisoning case is a thorough assessment with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care.
Assessing and stabilizing the airway is paramount. Early non-invasive interventions (eg, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) may suffice in minorly symptomatic patients; intubation with mechanical ventilation should not be delayed in patients with signs of significant airway compromise or hypoxia.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered in patients with severe hypoxemia that is refractory to mechanical ventilation.
Avoid the use of epinephrine in the treatment of tachydysrhythmias; cardiac sensitization to catecholamines, known as “sudden sniffing death,” may occur in patients who are suddenly startled or are exposed to exogenous epinephrine or norepinephrine. Beta blockers may be considered as treatment, in addition to amiodarone and lidocaine. Electrical cardioversion may be ineffective.
Treat seizures with benzodiazepines.

Key Concepts
Hydrocarbons are a diverse group of chemicals found in many household and industrial products. Acute hydrocarbon toxicity may result in a wide array of pathology depending on the chemical and route of exposure.
Pulmonary aspiration is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality.
Oral hydrocarbon exposure should be monitored for potential pulmonary aspiration.
All patients with potential aspiration require a chest radiograph (CXR). Symptomatic patients require urgent imaging. If patients are initially asymptomatic, imaging may be obtained after an observation period (~6 h after ingestion) prior to discharge.
Pulmonary aspiration may present with subtle, non-specific signs/symptoms, including fever, cough, tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, and altered mental status.
There exists no evidence to support prophylactic treatment of aspiration pneumonitis with antibiotics or corticosteroids.
Gastric decontamination may cause more harm than benefit and is generally avoided.
Do not underestimate the potential severity of seemingly minor ingestions.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Aliphatic Hydrocarbons (Kerosene, Gasoline, Lamp Oil, Heating Oil)
Traditional textbook presentation: A toddler is found coughing after ingesting lighter fluid next to the grill outside. An adult presents at the ED with gasoline-soaked clothes after being caught by police attempting to siphon gas from another vehicle.
The majority of patients will have normal vital signs and a benign physical exam.
Symptomatic patients may present with the following:
Coughing, dyspnea, cyanosis
52% of patients develop pulmonary complications after ingestion of >30 mL.
39% of patients develop pulmonary complications after ingestion of <10 mL.
Fever
64% of patients develop aspiration pneumonitis.
Vomiting
35% of patients present with vomiting.
Aromatic and Halogenated Hydrocarbons (Inhalants: Spray Paint, Model Airplane Glue, Industrial Pesticides)
Textbook presentation: A teenager that has inhaled fumes from spray paint presents at the ED with somnolence, dysarthria, and normal vital signs.
Symptomatic patients may present with the following:
Pulmonary: Coughing, gagging, dyspnea
This typically occurs within 30 min of initial ingestion.
Cyanosis may be seen in 2-3% of patients.
Ear/nose/throat (ENT): Perioral eczema (Huffer’s rash)
Neurological: Somnolence, slurred speech, confusion, tremors, paresthesias, weakness, seizure
Cardiac: Palpitations, ectopy, tachydysrhythmias 
Chlorine and Chloramines (Pool and Water Disinfectants)
Traditional textbook presentation: An adult is found unconscious in a poorly ventilated pool maintenance room. A custodian worker is found on the ground in a small room after mixing bleach and ammonia.
Symptoms are typically rapid in onset, occurring within minutes of exposure to chloramines. These may be more delayed after exposure to chlorine gas.
ENT: Burning sensation in the eyes, nose, and throat. After severe exposure, croup-like cough, difficulty swallowing, and upper airway swelling with stridor may occur.
Pulmonary: Coughing, wheezing. After severe exposure, pulmonary edema may occur with resulting hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
Phosgene
Traditional textbook presentation: A welder has developed worsening shortness of breath 4 h after working on pipes recently cleaned with chlorinated solvents.
Phosgene was historically used as a chemical warfare agent.
Symptoms are typically delayed in onset due to lower water solubility, which can lead to a longer exposure time.
Pulmonary: Coughing, wheezing, pulmonary edema, hypoxia. Lower airway complications may be delayed up to 24 h after exposure.
Testing should be tailored to the specific hydrocarbon or inhalant exposure.
If exposure is unknown, standard labs and diagnostics include blood gas, CBC, CMP, ECG, and CXR.
CXR is required for all hydrocarbon and inhalant exposures.
50% of patients with a normal clinical exam have radiographic evidence of pneumonitis; 5% show evidence 6 h after exposure.
Evidence of hydrocarbon aspiration is present within 2 h of exposure in 88% and within 12 h in 98%.
Radiographic evidence of pneumonitis occurs in 40-88% of patients admitted after aspiration.
Some halogenated hydrocarbons may be radiopaque.
Hydrocarbon/inhaled toxin-specific
Toluene → CMP may reveal hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperchloremia, and metabolic acidosis. Mimics distal renal tubular acidosis; the key differentiating factor is an increased anion gap in acute intoxication, although toluene can also cause non-gap acidosis. Urine electrolytes may be helpful in making the diagnosis.
Carbon tetrachloride → CMP may show elevated liver enzymes (hepatotoxic). Blood gas may suggest methemoglobinemia.
Benzene → CBC may reveal hemolysis and acute myeloid leukemia.
Halogenated hydrocarbons → obtain an ECG.
Treatment
Initial management should be ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure).

Background
Hydrocarbons are compounds consisting of hydrogen and carbon and can exist in various forms: gas, liquid, solid, or polymer. There are 4 classes of hydrocarbons: aliphatic, terpene, aromatic, and halogenated.
Epidemiology
Globally, ingestion of aliphatic hydrocarbons (kerosene, gasoline, lamp oil, heating oil, industrial solvents) accounts for 5% of accidental poisonings and approximately 25% of deaths in children <5 y old.
In the U.S., pediatric patients account for 63% of accidental ingestions. 
Gasoline accounts for the highest proportion of ED visits (31.9%) and poison center calls (27.6%).
The highest proportions of related hospitalizations are reported for kerosene (25.1%) and lamp oil (23.2%).
Pathophysiology
Kerosene and gasoline are liquid mixtures of hydrocarbons (chain lengths of C9-16) produced by the distillation of crude oil and are used in gas-powered cooking stoves and motorized vehicles.
Ingestion and inhalation are the primary routes of toxic exposure.
The oral toxicity (LD50) of kerosene based on animal models is 20-30 g/kg. Intratracheal dosing of kerosene liquid (which models the aspiration of vomit in humans) results in a substantial (10- to 150-fold) increase in toxicity.
Primary pulmonary toxicity is due to disruption of the surfactants lining the alveoli caused by a decreased maximum surface area and increased minimum surface tension required for surfactant aggregation. This ultimately leads to alveolar collapse and terminal bronchiolar obstruction.
N-hexane is a volatile aliphatic hydrocarbon derived from crude oil and natural gas. It is used as an industrial and lab reagent. When mixed with solvents, it is also known as “petroleum benzene.”
Rapidly absorbed in the lungs via passive diffusion (Tmax <20 min). It has a wide systemic distribution (adipose >> liver, brain, muscle > kidney > heart > lung > blood).
It is metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione via mixed-function oxidases in the liver (including CYP-450) and is primarily excreted via the renal system, with an additional 10-20% exhaled unchanged.
2,5-hexanedione and the intermediate metabolite, 2-hexone, account for toxicologic effects via the formation of pyrrole rings. These rings subsequently cause neurofilament crosslinking via autoxidation, resulting in local neuronal injury, primarily at the nodes of Ranvier of myelinated axons.
In Japan in 1969, 296 sandal makers were exposed, resulting in 93 cases of peripheral neuropathy. All had complete or near complete recovery after 3-18 months.
Camphor and other select essential oils are a diverse group of monoterpene compounds derived from plant and tree oil extracts, which are commonly encountered as food additives and alternative medicine tinctures. Historically, camphor was used as a moth repellent but has largely been replaced in the U.S.
Camphor
Rapidly absorbed via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract
Highly lipid-soluble and crosses the blood-brain barrier and placenta
Undergoes first-pass metabolism with hydroxylation and glucuronidation
Inactive metabolites are excreted in the urine
Pine oil
The primary active toxic effects are caused by α-pinene
Absorbed via GI or inhalational exposure
As a volatile hydrocarbon, it possesses low viscosity and lipophilicity, allowing it to accumulate in adipose and pulmonary tissues
Pennyroyal oil
The active ingredient, R-(+)-pulegone, is primarily hepatically metabolized to the reactive metabolite, menthofuran, via cytochrome P-450 oxidases (CYP 1A2 and 2E1).
The toxicity results from these reactive metabolites binding to cellular proteins and causing necrosis. In the liver, depletion of glutathione results in centrilobular hepatic necrosis. In the lungs, electrophilic reactive metabolites cause bronchial necrosis.
Nutmeg
The primary toxicity is caused by myristicin; additional toxic components include mace, eugenol, and other terpene compounds.
Myristicin is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that is also thought to increase cerebral serotonin concentrations.
Aromatic and Halogenated Hydrocarbons
Toluene is derived from the distillation of crude petroleum toluene and is used as a solvent for paints, lacquers, thinners, and adhesives. It is used extensively in the rubber, chemical, paint, dye, glue, printing, and pharmaceutical industries.
Toluene is absorbed rapidly after inhalation or ingestion. It is absorbed slowly through intact skin; however, percutaneous absorption may contribute to the total body burden.
It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism; 80% is metabolized to benzyl alcohol and ~70% is ultimately renally excreted as hippuric acid, with a biological half-life of approximately 3 h.
The toxicity is caused by the primary compound and its metabolites. Initial central nervous system (CNS) symptoms are likely due to gamma aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonism and enhanced serotonin transmission. Long-term CNS toxicity is thought to be secondary to interference with neuronal proteins causing leukoencephalopathy. 
Cardiac toxicity is due to a reduced threshold for the effects of epinephrine.  Pulmonary toxicity is due to the direct mucosal irritation effects of toluene. Renal and metabolic toxicity are primarily due to hippuric acid, which can cause glomerulonephritis and renal failure and can mimic renal tubular acidosis. 
Carbon tetrachloride is a liquid used to produce refrigeration fluid and propellants for aerosol cans. It has also been used as a cleaning fluid in the dry cleaning industry, a degreasing agent in household cleaners, and a pesticide. Its use has significantly declined as a result of its toxicity.
Rapidly absorbed from the GI and respiratory tracts and more slowly following cutaneous exposure. Once absorbed, it is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, and toxic metabolites are formed during phase 1 dehalogenation in the liver.
The toxicity is due to free radical formation and resulting lipid peroxidation and formation of protein adducts. The high concentration of phase 1 hepatic enzymes in the centrilobular region of the liver leads to primary injury of zone 3 of the hepatic lobule. 
Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) exposure limits: 8-h weighted average, 10 ppm; maximum exposure limit, 25 ppm.
No established human LD50, but a review of case studies indicates that ingestion of 14-150 mL could be fatal. Ingestion of as little as 1.5 mL (34 mg/kg) has caused death in a few cases.
Non-hydrocarbon Inhaled Toxins
Pulmonary irritants are a heterogeneous group of chemicals that produce respiratory insufficiency via destruction of the mucosal barrier of the respiratory tract.
Chlorine (chloramines) is a yellow-green, non-combustible gas with a pungent, irritating odor. Chlorine gas is formed by the combination of hypochlorite solutions and acid. Chloramines are gases formed by the combination of hypochlorite solutions and ammonia, with toxic effects similar to those of chlorine.
Chlorinated gases and liquid solutions are mucosal irritants that cause local tissue injury to exposed surfaces. Upon mixing with water, they liberate hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids.
The recommended safe occupational exposure to chlorine gas is <0.5 ppm averaged over 8 h. Short-term exposure toxicity can occur at 1 ppm, with 10 ppm considered immediately dangerous to life or health.
Concentrations of 34-51 ppm have been reported to be lethal in 1-1.5 h.
Phosgene is a colorless, non-flammable gas at room temperature, with a suffocating odor similar to newly mown hay. It is produced commercially by chlorinating carbon monoxide and is also a combustion or decomposition by-product of most volatile chlorinated compounds; therefore, household substances such as certain solvents, paint removers, and dry-cleaning fluids can produce phosgene when exposed to heat or fire. Phosgene may also be produced during the welding of metal parts that have been cleaned with chlorinated hydrocarbons. 
The toxicity is due to increased capillary permeability, resulting in large shifts in body fluid and decreasing plasma volume. Phosgene is hydrolyzed to form hydrochloric acid, which may damage surface cells and cause cell death in the alveoli and bronchioles. These direct effects, coupled with the induction of an immunologic systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cause massive pulmonary edema.
Sustained exposure to 3 ppm is considered immediately dangerous to life or health.

CXR should be obtained 6 h after initial ingestion; 5% of patients without clinical signs of pulmonary involvement have radiographic findings 6 h after initial exposure. 
N-hexane
Clinical manifestations
Progressive peripheral neuropathy (motor and sensory).
Reversible after removal from the source; the recovery period is variable (6 mo to 2 y).
There have been no known fatal human exposures.
Historical incident in Japan, 1969: 296 sandal makers were exposed, with 93 cases of peripheral neuropathy. All had complete or near complete recovery after 3-18 mo. 
Diagnostics
No specific laboratory testing is necessary in the ED.

Symptom onset can be rapid, within 15 min of ingestion of >30 mg/kg.
Neurologic complications are common. Seizures can occur within 90 min of ingestion and may be preceded by muscle fasciculations, confusion, delirium, hallucinations, and restlessness.
Pulmonary: Dyspnea and respiratory depression are common following seizure.
GI: Oral/epigastric burning, nausea, vomiting; hepatotoxicity can cause a Reye syndrome mimic in children.
Cardic: Case reports of cardiomyopathy and prolonged QRS and QTc have been described.
Nutmeg toxicity can mimic anticholinergic toxidrome (ie, agitation and miosis), helping to distinguish it from other ingestions.
Toxic syndrome onset is 3-6 h after ingestion and typically resolves within 24 h.

Pulmonary: Coughing, gagging, dyspnea
After acute ingestion, typically within 30 min.
Cyanosis may be seen in 2-3% of patients.
Neurologic: Somnolence, slurred speech, confusion, tremors, paresthesias, weakness; seizures are commonly seen with acute toxicity and may be present after repeated chronic exposure due to white matter injury causing leukoencephalopathy. 
Cardiac: Palpitations and tachydysrhythmias can occur suddenly and should be monitored closely.
ENT: Perioral eczema (Huffer’s rash) is commonly seen with repeated exposure.
Diagnostics
CXR is indicated to assess for chemical pneumonitis.
ECG may reveal tachydysrhythmias in response to catecholamines.
CMP: Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis are common, although a non-gap acidosis can also be observed. 
Urinal hippuric acid does not correlate well with systemic effects and is not available immediately; however, it can help to confirm the diagnosis or etiology (eg, confirm occupational exposure).
Carbon Tetrachloride
Clinical manifestations
Pulmonary: Dyspnea, coughing; hypoxia can be seen in patients with chemical pneumonitis.
GI: Oral ingestion of greater than 30-40 mL (680-910 mg/kg) frequently causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Diagnostics
CXR is indicated to assess for chemical pneumonitis following oral ingestion and inhalation exposure.
CMP and PT/INR should be obtained to assess for renal and hepatic injury.
CBC may show mild anemia.
Blood gas should be utilized to assess for methemoglobinemia after significant exposure.
In unclear chemical exposures, measurement of the parent carbon tetrachloride in expired air can be used to quantify exposure.

Hypoxia
Supplemental oxygen
Initiate treatment with 100% oxygen.
Consider 100% oxygen plus hyperbaric oxygen if there is evidence of exposure to the carboxyhemoglobin-inducing chemicals methylene chloride and carbon monoxide or other asphyxiant gases.  
Intubation
High ventilation/perfusion mismatch typically requiring high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
Consider high-frequency ventilation (HFV) to reduce the risk of pulmonary barotrauma in patients requiring high PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation (respiratory rate 220-270) (level of evidence III).
HFV aims to decrease pulmonary inflammation and prevent further pulmonary injury by minimizing tidal volumes and lowering the peak and mean airway pressures. There are two primary modalities for HFV: high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). HJFV utilizes a jet ventilator in conjunction with a conventional ventilator connected via a pinch valve to an ETT adaptor. The jet ventilator delivers short high-frequency gas pulses to facilitate gas exchange, while the conventional ventilator maintains lung volume via PEEP. HFOV utilizes high-frequency piston movement to introduce positive and negative changes in the baseline mean airway pressure (MAP). The biphasic waveform generates gas exchange, while the MAP is adjusted to maintain the goal lung volume. 
Surfactant (level of evidence III) 
Case reports have shown the survival of infants following intratracheal administration of 200 mg/kg surfactant. 
ECMO (level of evidence III)
Indicated if there is failure to adequately treat hypoxia with mechanical ventilation. 
Corticosteroids (level of evidence I)
There exists no evidence indicating that the routine administration of corticosteroids for the treatment of pneumonitis improves pulmonary outcomes, while an increased incidence of bacterial superinfection has been reported. 
Antibiotics (level of evidence I)
There exists no evidence indicating that the prophylactic administration of antibiotics improves patient outcomes.
Antibiotics should cover atypicals in patients who develop a fever or have other signs of bacterial pneumonia superinfection in initial pneumonitis. 
Cardiovascular
Tachydysrhythmia
Routine advanced cardiac life support/pediatric advanced life support resuscitation.
Beta blockers (level of evidence III) 
Dosing in children and adolescents
Esmolol IV bolus 100-500 μg/kg over 1 min, followed by a continuous IV infusion: Initial rate, 25-100 μg/kg/min, subsequently titrate in 25- to 50-μg/kg/min increments. 
Dosing in adults
Initial intervention: Esmolol loading dose (optional): 500 μg/kg over 1 min, followed by a 50-μg/kg/min infusion for 4 min. If refractory, consider esmolol IV infusion 25-100 μg/kg/min. 
Amiodarone and lidocaine (level of evidence III)
Hypotension
Aggressive IV crystalloid resuscitation.
Consider phenylephrine if vasopressors are required for the treatment of shock. Pure α-1 agonism will increase the systemic vascular resistance without increasing the heart rate or contractility, as occurs with β-agonist vasopressors.
Decontamination
Routine gastric decontamination with gastric lavage is contraindicated.
Consider decontamination with gastric lavage if there is known exposure to hydrocarbon compounds with a high systemic toxicity (CHAMP).
CHAMP: Camphor, carbon tetrachloride, halogenated, aromatic, metal-(containing), pesticides
Hydrocarbons are moderately bound by activated charcoal, but additional gastric distension may precipitate emesis following hydrocarbon ingestion.
A single dose of activated charcoal is contraindicated following ingestion of highly volatile, low-viscosity hydrocarbons (kerosene, lamp oil, essential oils) because it increases gastric distension and the risk of potential emesis and aspiration.
Neurological
Agitation, seizures
Benzodiazepines
The American Epilepsy Society and Neurocritical Care Society recommendations for benzodiazepine dosing in the management of acute seizures in children and adults are as follows:
Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IM/IV
Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IM/IV
Diazepam 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV or 0.2-0.5 mg/kg PR
Renal
Electrolyte abnormalities
Correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels aggressively.
Hemodialysis may be indicated in severe hypokalemia. 
Significant caution should be exercised with the administration of sodium bicarbonate because it can precipitate intracellular potassium.
Hepatic
Carbon tetrachloride
Cutaneous
Superficial
Evidence suggests that early decontamination with removal of the source and contaminated clothing, followed by washing with soap and water, is effective for decreasing systemic toxicity.
The standard symptomatic treatment for contact dermatitis is effective for managing superficial exposure.
Injection
Consultation of hand surgery is indicated for the management of potential deep tissue injury.
Post Care
Toluene
Patients who remain asymptomatic for 6-12 h after exposure may be discharged with primary care follow-up.
Patients who have corneal injuries should be re-examined within 24 h.
No long-term sequelae due to a single acute exposure to toluene have been reported.
Discharge instructions
Prevention
Hydrocarbons should be safely stored out of reach of small children.
Parents should be educated about the risks of hydrocarbon exposure in children, especially with products such as tiki torch fluid, where parents may not fully realize the potential dangers.
Maintain a high index of suspicion of inhalant abuse among teenagers/young adults presenting to the ED with substance abuse and altered mental status.
Occupational exposure can be prevented by ensuring the use of personal protective equipment when needed and adhering to OHSA guidelines/regulations.",Hydrocarbons and Inhaled Toxins

Key Concepts
Hypoglycemia (severe, <55 mg/dL) typically produces a distorted mental status (eg, agitation, confusion, lethargy, coma) with occasional seizures.
Pharmacologic agents are the most common cause, principally insulin and sulfonylureas. Other diabetes medications (eg, metformin, meglitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DDP-4] inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors) in isolation are rarely the source.
Alternative etiologies of hypoglycemia, such as an infection causing increased basal catabolism, must also be considered.
Pediatric patients and those with renal insufficiency are at high risk for prolonged drug effects.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Classic presentation: A 2-y-old with no medical history, living in the home of an adult diabetic, presents to the ED with a seizure and hypoglycemia.
Classic presentation: An elderly diabetic patient is brought in by ambulance when a neighbor asks police to perform a welfare check after the patient has not been seen for a few days; the patient presents with lethargy and confusion.
Hypoglycemia is most common in diabetic patients.
Classic manifestations are an autonomic (ie, neurogenic) response to diminishing glucose levels:
Anxiety
Palpitations
Tremulousness
Mydriasis
Diaphoresis
Recognized as the great imitator, hypoglycemia mimics various other conditions (eg, seizure, stroke, encephalitis).
Evaluation begins with a thorough history (symptom onset, relation to meals, medications, and past medical, surgical, and social history). Collateral information (eg, medication bottles) should also be ascertained from emergency medical services, family, friends, and the electronic medical record. It is equally important to identify the exposure as being accidental or intentional.
Inquire about high-risk medications (listed below) with hypoglycemic effects:
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
Bactrim
Barbiturates
Beta blockers
Quinolones
Haloperidol
Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors
Pentamidine
Salicylates
Perform a CMP to evaluate glucose, renal, hepatic, and metabolic abnormalities that may be precipitating hypoglycemia. Further labs/diagnostics may be indicated; however, they should be subsequent to and based on the history, exam, and initial laboratory analysis.
Awakening from sleep with diaphoresis, confusion, or irritability signals nocturnal hypoglycemia. Up to 50% of hypoglycemic events may occur during sleep; these often herald dysrhythmias and unforeseen death (“dead-in-bed” syndrome).
Treatment
Hypoglycemia management is tailored to the identified cause and may require dietary, medical, and/or surgical therapies. Immediate therapy is focused on increasing the glucose level.
Patients who are alert, cooperative, and not at risk for decompensation should receive 15-20 g of glucose every 15 min until resolution of hypoglycemia; inability to tolerate oral sources of glucose warrants IV therapy, as discussed above.
Dextrose:
Adults: D50W 1-2 mL/kg IV bolus
Children: D25W 2-4 mL/kg IV bolus
Neonates: D10W 5-10 mL/kg IV bolus
Maintenance infusion (D5W, D10W, or D20W):
6 mL/kg/h (for first 10 kg)
+3 mL/kg/h (for 11-20 kg)
+1.5 mL/kg/h (for each additional kg >20 kg)

Children: 1 μg/kg SC/IV q6-12h
Disposition
Home
Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic adults who experience no further hypoglycemia >6 h following an accidental overdose.
Admission
Asymptomatic children warrant 24-h observation in a monitored setting for potentially delayed hypoglycemia. 
For severe or persistently symptomatic patients, admission to a monitored floor versus an intermediate/intensive care unit is dependent on the frequency of glucose monitoring and the complexity of pharmacologic treatment and dextrose supplementation.",Hypoglycemic Agents
"Deep Dive
Background
Glucose is the sole energy source for the brain.
Low glucose levels impair brain function; if severe and protracted, permanent brain damage and death are possible.
Several physiological counter-regulatory mechanisms exist to prevent hypoglycemia; an initial decrease in endogenous insulin secretion is followed by an increase in glucagon and epinephrine secretion as well as growth hormone and cortisol.
Epidemiology
Prevalence and outcomes of diabetes medication overdose from the 2017 National Poison Data System annual report: 
Insulin: 6,974 case mentions, with 953 “moderate outcomes,” 47 “major outcomes,” and 2 deaths.
Biguanides (eg, metformin): 9,402 case mentions, with 250 “moderate outcomes,” 58 “major outcomes,” and 21 deaths.
Sulfonylureas: 3,642 case mentions, with 442 “moderate outcomes,” 38 “major outcomes,” and 2 deaths.
DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists combined: 1,983 case mentions, with 43 “moderate outcomes,” 5 “major outcomes,” and 0 deaths.
Insulin and sulfonylureas are by far the most commonly implicated causes of pharmacologic hypoglycemia. All other reports of hypoglycemia due to diabetes medications are exceedingly uncommon and of limited gravity and duration.
Pathophysiology
Antihyperglycemics that frequently induce hypoglycemia:
Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by direct stimulation of cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose.
Sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide) reduce blood glucose levels primarily by stimulating endogenous pancreatic insulin secretion and secondarily by enhancing peripheral insulin receptor sensitivity and reducing glycogenolysis.
Antihyperglycemics that alone seldom cause hypoglycemia although potentially associated with idiosyncratic adverse effects:
Meglitinides (eg, repaglinide) are similar to sulfonylureas and work by enhancing the secretion of endogenous pancreatic insulin.
Biguanides (eg, metformin) decrease hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis) and intestinal absorption of glucose while increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. They do not stimulate insulin secretion. Biguanides are known to occasionally cause significant lactic acidosis, typically in the setting of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency or a large acute overdose. 
Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) decrease hepatic glucose output and improve the target cell response to insulin.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (eg, acarbose) delay the digestion of ingested carbohydrates, reducing postprandial blood glucose concentrations.
GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, liraglutide) lead to increased insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations, while glucagon secretion is blocked.
DDP-4 inhibitors (eg, vildagliptin) act at DDP-4 enzymes, which inactivate incretin hormones. The inhibition of DDP-4 enzymes produces increased and prolonged active incretin levels, leading to an increased insulin release and decreased glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. 
SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin) reduce the reabsorption of filtered glucose in the proximal renal tubules, increasing urinary glucose excretion. Excessive intravascular volume depletion secondary to this pharmaceutical can cause hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Certain populations (eg, diabetics, the elderly) suffer from hypoglycemia-associated neurogenic failure and loss of early autonomic warning signs, leading to a high risk for hypoglycemia.
Neuroglycoplegic symptoms (eg, confusion, delirium, seizures) occur late and are much more severe due to glucose depletion in the central nervous system. 
Although pediatric exploratory ingestions and adult therapeutic errors are the most common causes of hypoglycemic agent overdose, a number of other etiologies should also be considered (listed below):
Sepsis
Renal insufficiency
Hepatic disease
Adrenal/thyroid insufficiency
Pituitary insufficiency
Acute intoxication
Polypharmacy
Nutrition
Non-islet cell tumor secreting insulin-like growth factor II
Post-surgical (eg, bariatric)
Functional B cell disorder
Insulin autoimmune syndrome
Ingestion (accidental or intentional)
Insulinoma
If the etiology of hypoglycemia remains indeterminate after initial history and testing, additional data should be obtained based on individual patient risk factors (eg, comorbidities, polypharmacy) and provider suspicion.
Sepsis: Cultures (urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid), UA, CXR, and lactate, which may be suggestive of infection or metformin toxicity.
Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisol, cosyntropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone), and stimulation testing.
Insulin secretion (endogenous versus exogenous): C-peptide, proinsulin, insulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and confirmatory drug panels (eg, sulfonylureas).
Sulfonylurea poisoning should be suspected in hypoglycemic patients who are abusing prescription benzodiazepines; they are frequently sold “on the street” in lieu of benzodiazepines.
Therapeutic Considerations
Glucose
Oral sources of carbohydrates and sugars offer superior quantity and duration of glucose delivery compared with IV dextrose and are thus the treatment of choice in the awake patient.
Response to glucose can be seen within minutes of administration, although a complete return to baseline levels of consciousness requires slightly more time (up to 1 h). If the expected course of recovery is not achieved, an alternative diagnosis must be considered.
Glucagon
When IV access is not immediately available, glucagon offers a rapid parenteral treatment by mobilizing glycogen stores. However, due to its reliance on glycogen stores, it has an effect ceiling, which may have already been quenched before the patient’s arrival at the ED if they have experienced a prolonged period of hypoglycemia and/or concurrent illness.
Dextrose
While less robust than oral sources of carbohydrates, IV dextrose is often needed for treatment of patients, providing an immediate parenteral delivery of glucose for patients with altered mental status and/or prolonged hypoglycemia.
A common error is the assumption that glucose levels will remain corrected after initial bolus. IV dextrose supplementation is transient; patients should eat a meal (preferably with complex carbohydrates) to replenish glycogen stores.
For recurrent hypoglycemia, begin maintenance infusion therapy at 100 mL/h.
** 1 amp D50 = 50% dextrose = 25 g/50 mL = 25 g × (4 kcal/g carbs) = 100 cal **
1 L D5W = 5% dextrose = 5 g/100 mL × 1 L = 50 g × (4 kcal/g) = 200 cal = 20 cal/h
1 L D10W = 10% dextrose = 10 g/100 mL × 1 L = 100 g × (4 kcal/g) = 400 cal = 40 cal/h
1 L D20W = 20% dextrose = 20 g/100 mL × 1 L = 200 g × (4 kcal/g) = 800 cal = 80 cal/h
Octreotide
For patients with sustained hypoglycemia, octreotide is a mainstay of pharmacologic treatment. As an analog of somatostatin, it significantly antagonizes pancreatic insulin release.
Studies have demonstrated that octreotide reduces both the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes in sulfonylurea overdose. 
Prevention
For pediatric patients with sustained toxicity from a presumed exploratory ingestion, Munchausen by proxy, or abuse, both social work and local child/adult protective services should be involved before the patient’s release from medical care. 
For adults with sustained toxicity from a presumed accidental overdose or diet-pharmaceutical imbalance aside from prescription modifications, arrangements for post-discharge support should be considered depending on availability (eg, home health visits, expedited primary care follow-up).
For all patients with intentional overdose, psychiatric evaluation for safety must be obtained.",Hypoglycemic Agents

Approach to the Critical Patient
Iron poisoning may result in:
Significant fluid loss
Hypotension
Shock, and metabolic acidosis.
Initial treatment focuses on stabilizing the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation.
In cases of severe iron poisoning with:
Hypotension
Acidosis
Significantly elevated serum iron concentration
The chelator deferoxamine may be indicated.
See: Treatment Section
Key Concepts
Iron poisoning is rare, but may cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, acidosis, coagulopathy, and hepatotoxicity. Severe poisoning is associated with the ingestion of >60 mg/kg of elemental iron.
Early vomiting is nearly universal following significant iron poisoning.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Obtain a CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, ABG, and lactate in symptomatic patients.
Send a serum iron concentration 4-6 h after exposure.
Treatment
Deferoxamine is indicated when clinical signs of significant iron poisoning exist e.g., shock, acidosis, severe gastroenteritis, and consider with numerous radiopaque tablets on x-ray in setting of suspected iron poisoning. However, aggressive gastric decontamination whole bowel irrigation with PEG-ELS (GoLytely(R)) should also be administered in the presence of radiopaque tablets on x-ray.
The intravenous route of deferoxamine is the preferred route in all cases i.e., not just in cases of shock.
In both children and adults the infusion rate is started at 5 mg/kg/h increasing as tolerated over 15 minutes to a rate not to exceed 15 mg/kg/h.
The maximum cumulative daily dose generally should not exceed 6 g.
The intramuscular route is not recommended. Oral administration should not be used ever.
Establishing intravenous access is of paramount importance as aggressive fluid resuscitation is generally needed in severe iron poisoning and intravenous deferoxamine provides more reliable administration.
The major adverse effects of deferoxamine are administration rate-related hypotension, anaphylactoid reactions. Infusions of deferoxamine more than 24 hours of duration have been associated with pulmonary toxicity e.g., ARDS. Deferoxamine is a siderafore and when complexes iron can promote bacterial overgrowth of Yersenia enterocolitica leading to Yersenia sepsis.
Deferoxamine has also been used for aluminum toxicity in patients with renal failure.
Disposition
Home
Iron exposure without symptoms:
Ingestions of <20 mg/kg that are asymptomatic
Ingestions of >20 mg/kg that are asymptomatic, no tablets are visible on radiography, there is no acid-base disturbance, and iron concentrations are not elevated
Admission
ICU
Iron overdoses with ongoing symptoms will likely require an ICU admission to monitor volume status, acid-base disturbances, coagulopathy, and hepatotoxicity. Patients receiving deferoxamine require ICU admission to monitor for both iron toxicity and the adverse effects of deferoxamine therapy.",Iron
"Deep Dive
Background
Iron exposure and the risk of toxicity are classified by the amount of elemental iron that is ingested. Commercial iron preparations with % elemental iron include:
Ferrous gluconate: 12% elemental iron
Ferrous lactate: 20% elemental iron
Ferrous sulfate: 20% elemental iron
Ferrous chloride: 30% elemental iron
Ferrous fumarate: 33% elemental iron
Of note, carbonyl iron formulations are not expected to cause any toxicity. The ingestion of iron “gummies” or chewable iron tablets is rarely associated with significant toxicity due to the small quantity of elemental iron that is contained in these products
Epidemiology
The frequency of iron poisoning has decreased significantly due to successful interventions such as blister packaging, smaller dosages, and successful public education.
In 1997, the FDA mandated that all iron-containing preparations:
Display warning labels regarding the dangers of pediatric iron poisoning.
Any preparation that contains >30 mg of elemental iron must be placed into blister packaging.
Prescriptions must be for 30 d or less.
However, in 2003, the FDA rescinded the blister packing rules due to legal challenges, despite the significant number of iron poisonings that are still being reported to U.S. Poison Control centers.
Pathophysiology
Toxicity does not result from the ingestion of metallic iron.
Iron cannot be directly excreted by the human body. Iron levels are regulated by the absorption of iron salts in the GI tract in response to the body’s iron requirements.
The toxic effects of iron occur at doses of 10-20 mg/kg of elemental iron, and initially include predominantly GI effects (ie, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea).
The GI effects of iron reflect its local inflammatory effects on the GI epithelium.
The subsequent loss of salt and water contribute to the ill appearance of iron overdose patients.
Intestinal ulcers, edema, transmural inflammation, and in some extreme cases bowel ischemia and necrosis may occur.
The absence of GI signs/symptoms, specifically nausea and vomiting, within the first 6 h of an alleged ingestion essentially excludes serious iron toxicity.
Iron toxicity is classically described as a progression through 5 stages. However, many of these stages overlap, and not every patient will progress temporally through all of the stages.
The initial stage, which generally occurs during the first 6 h following iron ingestion, is characterized by a variety of GI symptoms: nausea, vomiting with possible hematemesis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
The second classic stage is a latent, or quiescent period, which is characterized by the resolution of GI symptoms without the development of serious systemic toxicity. This classically occurs 6-24 h following iron ingestion.
Patients may begin to develop lactic acidosis, lethargy, and tachycardia during this stage, without the obvious physical manifestations of worsening iron toxicity.
The third classic stage of iron toxicity is “shock,” which manifests as hypovolemia, vasodilation, poor cardiac output, and subsequent acidosis, all of which result from the systemic effects of iron on oxidative phosphorylation.
This stage may occur rapidly after a massive iron ingestion, or in a delayed (12-24 h) fashion following a moderate ingestion.
An iron-induced coagulopathy may lead to GI bleeding and exacerbate the patient’s hypotension.
The fourth stage of iron toxicity is characterized by hepatic failure and may occur 2-3 d following ingestion. Hepatic failure reflects the direct oxidative toxicity of iron on the hepatocytes.
The fifth stage of iron toxicity rarely occurs and is characterized by gastric outlet obstruction secondary to strictures and scarring from the initial iron insult to the GI mucosa. This may occur 2-8 wks following iron ingestion.
Diagnostic Testing
Radiography
Liquid and chewable pediatric iron tablets are not typically radio-opaque.
Adult tablet preparations often have a higher elemental iron concentration and may be seen on X-ray.
However, the absence of tablets or pill fragments on X-ray cannot reliably rule out potential toxicity.
Laboratory
The only reliable laboratory value in the diagnosis of iron toxicity is serum iron concentration. Other iron tests such as ferritin and total iron binding capacity are not useful in an acute overdose.
Obtain a serum iron concentration at least 4 h after exposure to account for delayed absorption.
Serum iron concentrations of 300-500 µg/dL are associated with significant GI toxicity and modest systemic toxicity.
Serum iron concentrations >500 µ/dL are associated with pronounced systemic toxicity and shock.
However, a low serum iron concentration cannot be reliably used to rule out potential toxicity.
Other useful testing
CBC: Monitor for hemolysis and leukocytosis. An elevated white blood cell count is associated with significant iron poisoning but is neither sensitive nor specific for iron toxicity.
Metabolic panel: Monitor acid-base status and electrolytes. Hyperglycemia has been associated with significant iron poisoning.
Hepatic panel: Monitor for hepatotoxicity.
Coagulation studies: Monitor for a coagulopathy.
Blood gas: Monitor lactate and acid-base status.
Urinalysis: Obtain prior to starting deferoxamine and serially during deferoxamine therapy to monitor for a reddish “vin rose” coloration due to the excreted deferoxamine-iron complex.
Therapeutic considerations
Decontamination
Iron is not adsorbed effectively by activated charcoal.
Given the early nausea and vomiting after an overdose, induced emesis is ill-advised.
Whole bowel irrigation is rational given the limitations of other decontamination methodologies. The usual dosing of polyethylene glycol is 1-2 L/h via gastric tube for adults, or 35 mL/kg/h for children.
Chelation
Deferoxamine is a specific iron chelator. Deferoxamine forms the complex ferrioxamine in the presence of iron (Fe3+), which is excreted by the kidneys and colors the urine reddish-brown.
Deferoxamine will chelate free iron and iron transported between transferrin and ferritin, but not the iron in transferrin, hemoglobin, hemosiderin, or ferritin. One-hundred milligrams of deferoxamine will chelate approximately 8.5 mg of ferric iron.
IV deferoxamine is recommended for iron-poisoned patients who demonstrate any of the following:
Metabolic acidosis
Repetitive vomiting
A toxic appearance
Lethargy
Hypotension or signs of shock
A serum iron concentration >500 µg/dl
Hypotension is the rate-limiting factor for deferoxamine administration, with a recommended maximum dose of 15 mg/kg/h noted in many sources.
However, larger doses can be successfully administered when co-administered with vasopressor agents to maintain the patient’s blood pressure.
Deferoxamine may be discontinued when the patient appears clinically well, the anion-gap acidosis resolves, and the urine color undergoes no further changes.
Prevention
Though the FDA rescinded earlier packaging rules for iron products, many manufacturers still follow these guidelines.
Education of both the public and healthcare professionals on the dangers of iron and iron-containing products has been effective at significantly reducing exposures.
Following an unintentional pediatric iron exposure, caregivers should be counseled on the dangers of iron poisoning and safe medication storage practices.",Iron
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
Identify and eliminate etiology.
Initial management: ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure).
All patients require continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
Methylene blue (MB) 1-2 mg/kg (0.1-0.2 mL/kg of 1% solution) IV slowly over 5-30 min, may repeat dose in 1 h if methemoglobin (MetHb) level >30% or symptomatic.
EM:RAP Audio EM:RAP Audio
Key Concepts
MetHb is an oxidized form of Hgb.
Many oxidant chemicals and drugs can induce MetHb. 
Medications:
Amyl nitrite, benzocaine, lidocaine, prilocaine, dapsone, nitric oxide, nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, phenazopyridine, quinones, sulfonamides
Xenobiotics: Nitrites/nitrates, aniline dye, chlorobenzene, naphthalene, trinitrotoluene
MetHb causes cyanosis and an unreliable pulse oximeter reading (~85%) that is unresponsive to O2; CO-oximetry analysis is the gold standard test.
Blood is described as “chocolate brown.”
Patient with poor cardiopulmonary conditions will have more severe symptoms.
Treatment is MB, which must be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: A 24-y-old man with a history of asthma is transported to the ED from the dentist’s office for “turning blue” and developing dyspnea just prior to dental extraction.
MetHb inducers act by oxidizing iron in Hb from the ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric (Fe3+) state. This abnormal hemoglobin is incapable of carrying oxygen, inducing functional anemia.
In addition, the O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the left, aggravating cellular hypoxia.
Methemoglobinemia does not cause hemolysis directly; however, many oxidizing agents that induce MetHb may cause hemolysis through either Hb (Heinz body) or cell membrane effects, particularly in patients with a low tolerance for oxidative stress (eg, G6PD deficiency).
Acquired methemoglobinemia occurs from an ingestion causing an acute change in oxygen delivery to the tissue, which yields cyanosis and/or hypoxia not responsive to oxygen.
Signs and symptoms are associated with MetHb levels:
MetHb at 10%-20%
Cyanosis (assuming a normal Hb concentration)
MetHb at 20%-50%
Dizziness, fatigue, headache, exertional dyspnea, anxiety
MetHb at 50%
Lethargy, stupor, metabolic acidosis, dysrhythmias
MetHb >70%
Lethal
Pertinent labs and diagnostics include arterial/venous blood gas, BMP, CBC, MetHb (CO-oximetry), and ECG.
Treatment
Discontinue offending agent.
MB
Indications: >30% MetHb, severe signs and symptoms.
MB 1-2 mg/kg (0.1-0.2 mL/kg of 1% solution) IV slowly over 5-30 min.
Repeat dose in 1 h if symptoms persist or MetHb >30%.
Excessive MB can result in cardiopulmonary compromise and hemolysis.
MB should not be given to patients with known G6PD deficiency.
Disposition
Admission
Severe, persistent, or worsening signs and symptoms or cases requiring antidotal treatment for refractory or long-acting oxidizing agent (eg, dapsone, aniline).",Methemoglobinemia
"Deep Dive
Background
MetHb is an oxidized form of Hb.
Many oxidizing chemicals and drugs can induce MetHb, including nitrites and nitrates, bromates, chlorates, aniline derivatives, antimalarials, dapsone, propanil, sulfonamides, metoclopramide, and local anesthetics (eg, benzocaine).
Epidemiology
Estimated incidence of MB use is ~100 cases per year.
Pathophysiology
MetHb inducers oxidize ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric (Fe3+) Hb; this abnormal Hb cannot carry O2, inducing functional anemia. In addition, the shape of the O2-Hb dissociation curve shifts to the left, aggravating cellular hypoxia.
MetHb must be reduced to Hb; under physiologic conditions, MetHb reduction is accomplished mainly by red cell NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (NADH-MetHb reductase) so efficiently that there is an insignificant amount of MetHb circulating in blood. 
Utilization of MB activates a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent pathway generated by G6PD in the hexose monophosphate shunt and reduces MetHb.
Diagnostic Considerations
Diagnosis is suggested by “chocolate brown” blood (usually apparent when MetHb is >15%) and the presence of hypoxemia (abnormal pulse oximeter ~85%) unresponsive to O2.
Arterial oxygen partial pressure (pO2) is normal.
Pulse oximetry is unreliable and does not accurately reflect the degree of hypoxemia in a patient with severe MetHb; it also may appear falsely abnormal in a patient who has been given MB due to colorimetric interference.
Severely anemic patients require a higher MetHb percentage to demonstrate cyanosis; however, these patients are more likely to exhibit signs of hypoxemia.
Signs and symptoms correlate well with measurable MetHb percentage and are caused by decreased blood oxygen content and cellular hypoxia.
Even at low levels, the skin discoloration “chocolate cyanosis,” especially of nails, lips, and ears, can be striking.
In most cases, mild metHb (<15%-20%) is well tolerated and will resolve spontaneously.
CO-oximetry is the gold standard in the diagnosis of MetHb:
<15%, usually asymptomatic
15%-20%, cyanosis, mildly symptomatic
20%-45%, marked cyanosis, moderately symptomatic
45%-70%, severe cyanosis, severely symptomatic
>70%, may be lethal
The only radiographic evaluation that may be beneficial is chest X-ray to assess for other causes of hypoxemia.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment is aimed at removal of the offending agent, aggressive O2 therapy, and treatment with the antidote MB. 
MB is indicated in a symptomatic patient with MetHb levels >30% or for whom even minimal compromise of O2-carrying capacity is potentially harmful.
MB 1-2 mg/kg (0.1-0.2 mL/kg of 1% solution) IV slowly over 5-30 min, may repeat dose in 1 h if MetHb level is >30% or symptomatic.
Treatment with MB can be complicated by underlying enzyme deficiencies, including G6PD deficiency. These patients may not produce sufficient NADPH to activate MB. In these cases, exchange transfusion may be considered. 
In patients with MetHb due to treatment with dapsone, co-administration of cimetidine with MB may reduce some of the hematologic side effects of dapsone. ",Methemoglobinemia

Key Concepts
Mushroom poisonings present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms, but the majority of cases are not life-threatening and can be managed with supportive care.
Specific therapies exist for amatoxin-containing, gyromitrin, and muscarine mushrooms.
Identification of the mushroom or toxidrome (if known) in addition to the time of exposure, mode, quantity, onset, and presenting symptoms is essential.
Gastrointestinal symptoms starting after or persisting beyond 6 h should raise concern for amatoxin-containing or gyromitrin mushroom ingestion.
Activated charcoal should be given early in suspected ingestions and repeated for amatoxin-containing mushrooms.
Consultation with Toxicology/Regional Poison Control Center (800) 222-1222 (throughout the U.S.) is recommended.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Identification of the mushroom or toxidrome (if known) in addition to the time of exposure, mode, quantity, onset, and presenting symptoms are key.
Early onset poisoning (onset of symptoms <6 h) is typically benign and comprises the majority of toxic mushroom ingestions.
Late onset poisoning (onset of GI symptoms >6h) is often serious, even fatal; consider the ingestion of amanita or gyromitra.
Beneficial diagnostic testing includes: ECG, CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactate, prothrombin international normalized ratio (PT/INR), CK, and serum ethanol level.
Treatment
Immediate assessment of ABCs is essential; patients are typically not in extremis.
Intravenous access and cardiopulmonary monitoring should be obtained early.
Given the propensity for GI symptoms, crystalloids should be initiated with dextrose and electrolyte repletion, as needed. Antiemetics should also be provided for nausea and vomiting.
Activated charcoal (1 g/kg) PO/NG should be given as soon as possible after ingestion, if the patient is symptomatic or serious toxic ingestion is suspected. Patients with CNS depression or cardiovascular instability should not be given activated charcoal because this significantly increases their risk for aspiration and GI complications.

"Deep Dive
Background
Mushrooms are the spore-producing fruiting bodies of fungi that are eaten around the world.
Most mushrooms are commercially grown and safely consumed, but accidental and intentional ingestions of wild mushrooms are still common.
Wild mushroom identification is very challenging, and poisonous mushrooms can easily be mistaken for edible mushrooms, even by seasoned mushroom foragers.
Types of exposures often depend on the geographical location and season.
Of the thousands of mushroom species, approximately 100 are considered potentially poisonous. 
In the U.S., mushroom poisoning incident data rely on reporting to Poison Control Centers and annual reports by the National Poison Data System (NPDS).
Epidemiology
A 30-year review of the National Poison Database System reported a mean of 7,428 mushroom exposures per year. 
83% unintentional.
86% caused no or minimal effects.
62% age <6 years old.
The most common intentional ingestion was for psychogenic effects.
86% were never identified, and the smallest group was the orellanine-containing mushrooms at 0.05%.
3 fatalities per year (68% amatoxin) were recorded, ingested unintentionally by adults with a mean age of 62 years.
Pathophysiology
The amatoxin-containing “death cap” mushrooms have a high morbidity and mortality due to hepatic failure. 
Amatoxin-containing and gyromitrin-containing mushroom ingestions have delayed onset nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that develop within 6-24 h of ingestion.
Diagnostic Considerations
An attempt should be made to identify the mushroom with the assistance of the regional poison control center at (800) 222-1222.
A picture of the mushroom can be useful to identify it and the potential toxicity and prognosis.
In all symptomatic patients, a CMP, CBC, coagulation profile, lactate, and ECG should be obtained.
The time of ingestion and the timing of the onset of symptoms are important when determining the prognosis of mushroom ingestions.
Early-onset poisoning (onset of symptoms <6 h) is typically benign and comprises the majority of toxic mushroom ingestions.
Late-onset poisoning (onset of symptoms 6-24 h) is often serious, even fatal; consider the ingestion of amanita or gyromitra.
Identifying the toxidromes or the organ systems affected can be useful if the mushroom cannot be identified. 
Hepatotoxicity/GI toxicity:
Early onset (<6 h): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain develops within 6 h of ingestion.
Symptoms typically resolve within 6 h of ingestion.
No evidence of end organ damage.
Delayed onset (>6 h): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain that develops 6 h after ingestion and typically persists.
Monitor serial LFTs and renal function over 24-72 h.
Amatoxin poisoning signs and symptoms follow 3 phases: 
Phase I (6-24 h after ingestion): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
Phase II (12-36 h after ingestion): Quiescent phase with transient improvement of symptoms.
LFTs (AST, ALT) begin to rise
Phase III (2-6 days after ingestion): Fulminant hepatic failure, renal failure.
Elevated bilirubin, coagulopathy, elevated creatinine, hypoglycemia
Hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, ascites, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
In a study from South Korea, all patients who ate wild mushrooms died if their bilirubin level was >5 mg/dL or aPTT >50 s IU/mL on day 3 post ingestion. 
In 23 patients who ate wild mushrooms in the San Francisco area who had evidence of liver injury, the peak AST and ALT occurred in 2-3 days and the peak INR in 3-4 days; good outcomes were noted if the peak serum AST was <4,000 IU/L, INR <2, and nadir Factor V was greater than or equal to 30%. 
A retrospective review of 23 patients with acute liver injury after eating mushrooms in South Korea found the Escudie criteria (diarrhea <8 h, decrease in PT index by <10% of normal, and INR >6 at more than 4 d post ingestion) were 100% accurate in predicting a 28-day mortality. 
Nephrotoxicity:
Early onset (amino hexadienoic acid):
Phase I (30 min-12 h after ingestion): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, weakness.
Phase II (2-5 d after ingestion): Oliguria, acute kidney injury, renal failure.
Delayed onset (orellanine):
Phase I (12 h-14 d after ingestion):
Pre-renal symptoms: Nausea (36%), vomiting (63%), diarrhea (17%), abdominal cramping (24%). 
Phase II (4-15 d after ingestion):
Lumbar/flank pain, oliguria, acute kidney injury, hematuria. 
Earlier onset acute kidney injury (2-3 d) is associated with more severe prognosis. 
Late onset acute kidney injury (>10 d) is typically associated with a mild acute kidney injury. 
Suspected ingestions should have appropriate follow-up to monitor BMPs and be given good return precautions for the development of oliguria, hematuria, and flank pain.
Therapeutic Considerations
Amatoxin poisoning:
Patients presenting with AST >4,000 IU/L and bilirubin >2 mg/dL warrant discussion with a regional liver transplant center for transfer. 
In a study of 23 patients with amatoxin poisoning, the King’s College Criteria were shown to have good prognostic value for urgent liver transplant candidates. In another study, all 16 of the patients that did not meet the King’s College Criteria for transplant survived with conservative treatment. 
In a review of 2,108 patients hospitalized with amatoxin poisonings over a 20-year period, the lowest mortality rates were associated with silibinin alone or in combination with NAC therapy.   
MARS, if available, can be a bridge to liver transplant or destination therapy. 
Nephrotoxicity:
Of 28 patients in Sweden who ingested the orellanine toxin in Cortinarius speciosissimus and rubellus, 22 (79%) required acute hemodialysis. After 1 mo, 21 (75%) required hemodialysis or renal transplant.

"Rapid Access- Plants
Approach to the Critical Patient
All patients require continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
While obtaining vital signs, blood glucose and electrocardiogram should be acquired.
Signs of respiratory compromise (increased/inability to tolerate secretion, upper airway noise, concern for airway edema) require early aggressive treatment, specifically patient repositioning, supplemental oxygen, and an airway adjunct (eg, nasal trumpet). This should be followed by endotracheal intubation if patient symptoms are not rapidly improving.
Airway toxins: Philodendron, dieffenbachia
Initial management of hypotension should begin with intravenous crystalloid resuscitation.

Furosemide 1 mg/kg (MAX 40 mg) IV
Key Concepts
Plant poisonings present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms, but the majority of cases are not life-threatening and can be managed with supportive care.
Cardiac dysrhythmias and neurologic complications caused by plant ingestions are the most life-threatening and warrant patient stabilization, resuscitation, supportive care, and the prompt use of antidotes such as digoxin-specific antibody fragments and physostigmine.
Consultation with a Toxicology/Regional Poison Control Center (800) 222-1222 (throughout the U.S.) is recommended.
Key Diagnostic Elements
The following laboratory data are beneficial: CMP, coagulation profile, and ECG.
If a cardiac glycoside plant such as foxglove or oleander is ingested, a serum digoxin concentration can be obtained. However, this value is only useful to qualitatively state that digoxin is present and should not be used to assess the degree of toxicity or to guide the dosing of digoxin fab fragments.
Treatment
The mainstay in any acute poisoning is a thorough assessment with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care.
This approach should occur after primary assessment is complete (ABCs for airway, breathing, circulation).
Activated charcoal (1 g/kg) can be provided PO/NG if within 1-2 hours of an acute ingestion. However, activated charcoal should not be given to those who are suffering CNS depression or cardiovascular instability.
Given the propensity of gastrointestinal symptoms, crystalloid with dextrose and/or electrolyte repletion should also be initiated. IVF, dextrose, antiemetics, and electrolyte repletions should be performed as needed.
Contact a regional Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for assistance with identifying plant toxin and further management.

Background
Toxic plant exposures can occur with household plants as well as outdoor plants.
Potentially toxic exposures depend on the geography, season, growing conditions, the way in which the plant is processed, amount of exposure, and method of exposure (ingested, tea extract, smoked, etc.).
Unintentional exposures are most common among children but can also occur when plants are misidentified as edible.
While many plants contain potentially toxic substances, life-threatening poisonings are rare.
For toxicological purposes, plants are typically referenced by the toxin that they contain.
In the U.S., plant poisoning incident data rely on reporting to Poison Control Centers and annual reports by the NPDS.
Epidemiology
In the U.S., the NPDS receives 50,000 calls for plant exposures annually. 
60% of exposures cause moderate to severe outcomes. The most severe outcomes occur in people seeking hallucinations and those who are suicidal.
Children <6 y old are responsible for 60% of exposures.
The majority of exposures are not identified.
Deaths are related predominantly to water hemlock, poison hemlock, and anticholinergic plants, although in Switzerland the record of unintentional fatalities is entirely due to autumn crocus ingestions. 
Pathophysiology
Diagnostics Considerations
An attempt should be made to identify the plant with the assistance of the regional poison control center at (800) 222-1222 (U.S.).
A picture of the flower, fruit, or seed of the plant can be useful to identify the plant family and potential toxicity.
In all symptomatic patients, a CMP, coagulation profile, and ECG should be obtained.
Identifying toxidromes or the organ systems affected can be useful if the plant is unable to be identified. Toxidrome identification can help guide management.
Airway toxic:
Calcium oxalate:
Ingestion results in intense oropharyngeal pain, swelling, and salivation, which can lead to airway compromise. 
Nasopharyngeal endoscope examination can aid decisions on the degree of airway compromise and the need for endotracheal intubation.
Cardiotoxic:
Cardiac glycosides:

Therapeutic Considerations
Cardiac glycosides
20 vials of digoxin-immune fab fragments are recommended to treat natural cardiac glycosides due to decreased affinity compared to pharmaceutical digoxin. 
100% of patients that ingest oleander will have nausea and vomiting. 
Single- or multi-dose activated charcoal may be helpful in oleander ingestion to prevent enterohepatic recirculation and continue to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract. 
A dose of three pong-pong seeds correlates to 100% ECG abnormalities, vomiting, and the need for pacing; 33% of patients typically have a fatal outcome. The minimum lethal dose was half a kernel in a series of 50 patients. 
36% (18/50) patients who ingested pong-pong seeds required pacemaker therapy. 
Thrombocytopenia occurred in 50% of patients eating pong-pong seeds and was associated with vomiting, ECG abnormalities, and the need for a pacemaker. 
Sodium channel toxins
Because aconite and the other plant toxins that affect sodium channel openers maintain sodium conduction, it is believed that the success of flecainide treatment is because of its sodium channel blocking properties. Animal models support the success of flecainide in terminating aconite dysrhythmias. Amiodarone and lidocaine are reasonable second-line choices. 
Prolonged CPR and cardiopulmonary bypass are good options for cases of aconite ingestion refractory to pharmacotherapy. 
The yew toxin (taxine) can cross react with the digoxin lab assay and cause a false positive serum digoxin concentration. Therefore, digoxin levels should never be used to determine the degree of toxicity. The cross-reactivity has influenced physicians to treat with digoxin-fab fragments. A dose of 4 vials and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been used successfully. 
There are multiple cases in which ECMO was used to treat refractory bradycardia and hypotension from the yew plant. 
Anticholinergics
Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anticholinergic delirium and vital sign abnormalities, although physostigmine is an option. 
Toxalbumins
Of 1,164 cases of toxalbumin exposures reported to the NPDS, 1% or fewer had a major effect, and none was fatal, despite this compound having the mechanism to cause multi-organ failure. 
Cyanogenic glycosides
After the National Antidote Program was established in Thailand, where the ingestion of cyanogenic glycosides is common, the appropriate use of sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite for toxicity resulted in lower mortality in patients with severe clinical symptoms. 
Cyanide antidotes should be used to treat hypotension, seizures, dysrhythmias, and lactate >8 mmol/L after cyanogenic glycoside exposure.
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids
Intrahepatic shunts have been used to treat portal hypertension after pyrrolizidine ingestions. 
Prevention
After clinical stability is achieved, use this opportunity to counsel the patient about the dangers of foraging and ingestion plants and mushrooms.
Counsel parents to keep household plants out of the reach of children.
Counsel patients to wear protective clothing when in the outdoors.",Mushrooms and Plants
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
All patients require continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
Care of the opioid-poisoned patient should focus on addressing the airway and breathing.
While obtaining vital signs, blood glucose and ECG should be acquired.
Naloxone is the antidote for opioid toxicity and rapidly reverses all drug effects; its primary indication is the reversal of life-threatening respiratory depression (eg, apnea, severe bradypnea, hypoxia, and/or severe hypercapnia).
Naloxone can be administered via the intravenous, intramuscular, intraosseous, intranasal, or endotracheal route. It has a rapid onset (within 1 min) and the duration of action is approximately 30-60 min.
The appropriate dose of naloxone is not well defined; however, most experts recommend a starting dose of 0.4 mg IV/IM/IO in the ED. Higher doses may be needed if given IN or via an endotracheal tube. It can be titrated and administered every 5 min.
Higher initial doses of naloxone or naloxone infusions may be required when dealing with long-acting opioids (ie, methadone), massive overdoses, or potent opioids such as fentanyl and its analogs.
Precipitated opioid withdrawal is the primary complication resulting from the use of naloxone, which can be avoided by the use of smaller, titrated doses.
Audio Board Review EM:RAP Audio
Key Concepts
An opioid is any substance, whether naturally occurring, semi-synthetic, or fully synthetic, that binds to and activates the opioid receptors. Most importantly, agonism of the μ-opioid receptor results in analgesia, sedation, and respiratory depression.
The classic clinical toxidrome is miosis coupled with central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression.
PITFALLS
Miosis may not always be present and should not be used as an indicator of opioid toxicity.
Tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids develops before tolerance to respiratory depression.
Respiratory depression manifests initially as hypoventilation and can progress to frank apnea, resulting in death.
Death from opioid misuse/abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S.
Fentanyl and its analogs have recently become the leading cause of death from opioids.
Increased opioid toxicity may be seen with concomitant use of sedative hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines, and in patients with pre-existing pulmonary disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Opioids classically cause pinpoint pupils and CNS and respiratory depression.
Those suffering from opioid toxicity may present with a history of substance abuse (illicit or prescription); however, other times, a physical exam and identification of the toxidrome are the only clue that opioids are involved.
Evidence of IV drug use (eg, needle or track marks) may also raise the suspicion of opioid abuse and toxicity.
Opioid toxicity should be considered in any patient presenting with CNS or respiratory depression. Miosis can be an insensitive finding and depends on the type of opioid involved (eg, meperidine), the severity of the toxicity (prolonged anoxia), and the use of other substances (eg, cocaine).
There are no specific laboratory or radiographic tests to confirm or rule out opioid toxicity.
A urine drug screen (UDS) can be obtained but has little, if any, clinical utility. It can detect the presence of morphine, but will neither reliably detect commonly abused opioids, such as oxycodone, nor detect full synthetic opioids such as methadone or fentanyl.
In the setting of opioid toxicity and prolonged immobilization, creatinine kinase should be obtained, in addition to other labs such as a metabolic panel, to check for rhabdomyolysis and renal injury.
Treatment
Supplemental oxygen (ie, nasal cannula) to maintain saturations >92%.
Naloxone 0.4 mg IV/IM/IN/IO or higher every 5 min as needed.
Naloxone continuous infusion: two-thirds × total bolus dose (mg/h).
Bolus dose = total dose required in the first hour.

Home
Patients who have received and responded to naloxone should be observed for at least 1 h from the last dose and should return to their baseline (ie, normalization of mental status, vital signs, and exam).
Opioid toxicity not requiring naloxone treatment can be observed for 4-6 h and patients may be discharged upon return to baseline (ie, normalization of mental status, vital signs, and exam). A longer period of observation is prudent in cases of long-acting opioid ingestion.
All patients should be discharged with naloxone and a prescription for naloxone with referral for substance abuse treatment.
Admission
Patients who have abnormal mental status, vitals signs, or physical exam 1 h after naloxone administration or following 4-6 h of observation should be admitted.
Patients requiring continual doses of naloxone or a naloxone infusion should be admitted.
Pediatric ingestions of Lomotil (diphenoxylate/atropine) should be admitted.
Patients with persistent opioid toxicity should be, at a minimum, admitted to a monitored unit with continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring; however, those with significant symptoms or requiring ongoing naloxone need a higher level of care (ie, ICU).",Opioids
"Deep Dive
Background
Opium is derived from the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). An opiate refers to a drug that comes from the poppy plant, whereas opioid refers to synthetic agents.
Opiates - opium, codeine, morphine.
Semi-synthetic opioids - heroin, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, buprenorphine, nalbuphine.
Synthetic opioids - fentanyl, methadone, meperidine, diphenoxylate, pentazocine, propoxyphene, butorphanol, tramadol.
Epidemiology
Opioids are among the most widely prescribed medications in the U.S. and are the most consumed drugs worldwide, with over 190,000 prescriptions filled in 2017. Nevertheless, this number has decreased from over 250,000 in 2012.  While the opioid epidemic was initially driven by the widespread misuse and abuse of prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic opioids now account for the majority of deaths.
Deaths from opioid toxicity have reached epidemic proportions, with almost 400,000 deaths attributed to opioids since 1999, including 47,600 deaths in the U.S. in 2017.  It is currently estimated that over 130 individuals die every day in the U.S. from opioid toxicity. 
Deaths from synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl) have risen over the last decade, with an 800% increase since 2010.  The abuse of illicit fentanyl and its analogs has become a significant public health concern, now associated with more than 50% of all opioid deaths. 
Pathophysiology
The potency of opioids can vary tremendously. Heroin is generally considered twice as potent as morphine.  This is in contrast to fentanyl and its analogs, which are often hundreds of times more potent than morphine.
Opioids bind to several opioid receptors (μ, κ, and δ) to cause analgesia, sedation, hypoventilation, bowel dysfunction, and miosis. The opioid receptors are G protein-linked, and activation results in reduced cellular excitability. The μ-opioid receptors are primarily responsible for the analgesic, euphoric, and respiratory depressant effects of opioids.
Opioids can be administered via multiple routes. Many are administered orally, while others, such as heroin, are inhaled or injected IV. Fentanyl and buprenorphine are examples of opioids with poor bioavailability, and are therefore marketed as transdermal drug delivery systems (“patches”). Toxicity can occur via dermal exposure to these patches. 
The acute toxicity of opioids is best summarized by the opioid toxidrome: Miosis and CNS and respiratory depression. The respiratory depression initially manifests as hypoventilation but can progress to life-threatening apnea.
Although not often considered in the emergency medicine setting, opioids can cause significant chronic toxicity, including bowel dysfunction, hyperalgesia, hearing loss, and endocrine dysfunction. 
While respiratory depression/apnea is the primary toxic effect of opioids as a class, several specific opioids have unique toxicity, which should be considered:
Methadone and loperamide can cause QT prolongation. 
Tramadol and meperidine can cause seizures. 
Tramadol and fentanyl may cause serotonin toxicity when taken with other serotonergic drugs. 
IV use of opioids, classically heroin, is associated with multiple complications, including soft tissue infection, endocarditis, hepatitis C, and HIV. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Patients with opioid toxicity will invariably present with a combination of CNS and respiratory depression. Although miosis is a typical finding, it may not be present in meperidine or tramadol overdoses or in cases with anoxic brain injury. 
There exists no diagnostic test for opioid toxicity; therefore, the diagnosis must be made from appropriate clinical history and astute physical exam.
While evaluating a potentially opioid-poisoned patient, it is important to remember that several other intoxications, such as α2-agonists (eg, clonidine, guanfacine) and antipsychotics (eg, olanzapine), can mimic opioid poisoning. 
Multiple other conditions can complicate opioid poisoning. Compartment syndrome should be considered in any patient who may have been down for an extended period of time.  Along with more routine soft tissue infections, wound botulism and injectional anthrax may result from injecting opioids.  Injection of oxymorphone (Opana ER) is associated with the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like illness. 
Radiographic Evaluation
In general, the use of radiography in evaluating a potentially opioid-poisoned patient will have the greatest value for comorbid conditions or alternative diagnoses.
CT of the head is indicated in patients with persistent altered mental status despite appropriate naloxone treatment to rule out other intracranial processes such as intracranial hemorrhage. Similarly, CXR may be indicated to evaluate for aspiration or pulmonary edema if patients have persistent hypoxia or respiratory distress after naloxone administration. Soft tissue U/S may be needed if there is concern for a soft tissue infection, such as an abscess, following IV use of opioids.
Laboratory Evaluation
There is no laboratory test that is diagnostic for opioid toxicity.
While frequently obtained, a CBC is rarely indicated or clinically useful in the opioid-toxic patient. A metabolic panel can demonstrate acute kidney injury, which may be due to rhabdomyolysis or evidence of metabolic acidosis, both of which should prompt further evaluation.
For patients found down, creatinine kinase should be ordered to check for rhabdomyolysis.
In cases where an intentional overdose is suspected, serum concentrations of acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol should be considered.
While not usually considered a laboratory test, an ECG should be obtained in all opioid-overdose patients, especially if there is concern for a cardiotoxic co-ingestant or if methadone or loperamide may be involved. Methadone is well known to cause QT prolongation but, recently, the misuse and abuse of loperamide has been implicated in fatal dysrhythmia due to its previously unappreciated potassium channel blocking effects. 
Depending on the specific test, UDS (immunoassays) may detect morphine (“opiates”), oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone, or fentanyl. It is important to remember that the commonly obtained opiate UDS will never detect methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, or other synthetic opioids. The other limitations of UDS should be considered when ordering this test. A UDS may be positive for several days after use of a substance, and a positive UDS does not confirm acute intoxication or the amount of drug taken, because it is a qualitative test. Furthermore, UDS results may be falsely positive, especially for the methadone screen, which can cross-react with diphenhydramine and quetiapine. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Once the diagnosis of opioid toxicity is made, consideration should be given to the need for antidotal therapy with naloxone. Naloxone is a competitive opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses the effects of opioids and is the gold standard treatment for clinically significant opioid-induced respiratory depression. The onset of action of naloxone is rapid (within 1 min) and the duration of action is approximately 45 min. It can be administered IV, IM, IN, IO, or via an endotracheal tube.
There is controversy surrounding the appropriate dosing of naloxone. In the ED, an initial dose of 0.4 mg IV is typical, although doses of 1 mg are still frequently given. Although there is no consensus, multiple emergency medicine guidelines suggest an initial dose of less than 0.05 mg IV. 
Fortunately, due to its rapid onset of action, naloxone can easily be titrated, and doses can be given every 5 min as needed. In rare cases involving massive overdose or intoxication from methadone, fentanyl, or fentanyl analogs, large amounts of naloxone may be required. While large doses (up to 10 mg) have been reported, these cases more commonly require frequent dosing of more typical amounts of naloxone. 
In patients who respond to naloxone but require 2 or more doses, a naloxone infusion may be indicated. The recommended starting dose for a naloxone infusion is two-thirds of the initial effective dose per hour. 
The optimal length of time to observe an opioid-toxic patient who has responded to a single dose of naloxone remains controversial. Traditionally, a 6-h observation period has been quoted, based on the approximate 1-h elimination half-life of naloxone; however, emergency medicine studies suggest that a 1-h post-naloxone observation period may be sufficient.  Christenson et al. found that patients who receive and respond to a single dose of naloxone for presumed opioid toxicity may be safely discharged if, at 1-h post-dose, they meet all of the following criteria:
Able to mobilize as usual
Have an oxygen saturation on room air of >92%
Have a respiratory rate >10 breaths/min and <20 breaths/min
Have a temperature of >35.0°C and <37.5°C
Have a heart rate >50 beats/min and <100 beats/min
Have a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15
It remains unclear whether these findings are applicable to patients who overdose on longer-acting opioids (methadone) or fentanyl and its analogs; these patients may require longer observation times.
All patients who require multiple doses of naloxone or who have not returned to baseline should be admitted for observation.
Naloxone is generally a safe medication with few side effects. Precipitated opioid withdrawal is the most common adverse reaction from naloxone use.  Gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, piloerection, mydriasis, and anxiety are commonly seen with precipitated opioid withdrawal. Most cases are self-limiting and result in no morbidity or mortality. However, the profound sympathetic surge associated with precipitated opioid withdrawal may rarely result in more serious side effects, such as delirium, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy.  Acute lung injury is also occasionally reported after naloxone administration. 
Other opioid antagonists are available, such as naltrexone and nalmefene; however, their role in the management of opioid toxicity in the ED is not currently well defined.
Prevention
Since the opioid epidemic was declared a public health crisis in 2017 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, multiple strategies have been deployed to combat it, one of which is ensuring appropriate prescription of opioids by physicians. Multiple states have established ED opioid guidelines that focus on identifying high-risk patients, limiting prescriptions, and avoiding diversion. 
In addition, the use of state drug-monitoring programs by physicians is associated with a decrease in opioid overdose deaths and should be encouraged in all EDs. 
Public access to naloxone is associated with a decrease in opioid-related deaths, and almost all states have passed legislation to improve naloxone access.  The American College of Emergency Physicians has issued a policy statement supporting the prescription of naloxone to ED patients who meet one of several criteria, including being “discharged from the ED following opioid intoxication or poisoning.” 
Finally, ED initiation of medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine has been advocated by some and may be beneficial in a select group of patients when the appropriate referral infrastructure is in place. ",Opioids

Key Concepts
Insecticide and cholinergic poisonings occur due to the inhibition of AChE in the synaptic cleft, causing an accumulation of acetylcholine. The result is an enhanced and prolonged cholinergic effect at both the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.
Cholinergic insecticides are classified as either OPs or carbamates, but both cause cholinergic symptoms via inhibition of AChE.
Diagnosis is made primarily by history and physical exam; treatment should not be delayed for confirmatory labs.
Exposure occurs via inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption.
Signs and symptoms can be remembered by any of the following mnemonics:
SLUDGE (salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal [GI] cramping, emesis).
DUMBELS (diarrhea, urination, miosis/muscle weakness/muscle fasciculations, bronchorrhea/bradycardia/bronchospasm, emesis, lacrimation, salivation/sweating).
Killer Bees (bronchorrhea, bradycardia, bronchospasm).
Most deaths are due to respiratory failure or ventricular dysrhythmias.
Atropine and oximes must be given as soon as possible.
Atropinization is best achieved by doubling each dose of atropine every 5 min until respiratory secretions have cleared.
Intermediate syndrome (IMS) is the recurrence of symptoms after an apparent clinical improvement; this condition can occur 24-96 h after exposure and frequently causes respiratory failure.

78% had miosis.
76% had altered mental status.
66% had hypersalivation.
55% had agitation.
25% had tachycardia.
23% had bradycardia.
Diagnostics
Confirmatory results of cholinergic poisoning will not be immediately available and should not change initial management based on history and symptoms.
OP poisoning analysis
Two types of cholinesterase levels should be obtained:
Red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC AChE) levels are more specific and coined “true cholinesterase.”
Serum cholinesterase is also termed “butyrylcholinesterase” or “pseudocholinesterase.”
Low levels are consistent with OP poisoning.

Background
Over 100 insecticides produce cholinergic effects.  They are classified as either OPs or carbamates. Although these types are chemically different, they produce cholinergic excess by the same mechanisms.
OPs are the principal component of pesticides and nerve gases; their mechanism of action is irreversible binding to AChE, ultimately preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine.
Similar to OPs, carbamates attach to AChE but reversibly; thus, the duration and severity of toxicity are reduced (<24 h).
Insecticides:
OPs 
Malathion
Paraoxon
Chlorpyrifos
Diazinon
Carbamates 
Aldicarb
Methomyl
Propoxur
Carbaryl
Epidemiology
It is estimated that 750,000 to 3 million people are deliberately or accidentally poisoned by OP and carbamate chemicals per year, with an estimated 300,000 deaths. 
The fatality rate ranges from 15% to 50%, even with sophisticated intensive care. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) lists pesticide poisoning as the single most common method of suicide worldwide. 
Pathophysiology
Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter released from the autonomic ganglia at sympathetic preganglionic synapses, parasympathetic postganglionic synapses, and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of skeletal muscle. It is the endogenous ligand of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors at synaptic junctions in the autonomic nervous system, central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), and NMJs. 
Under normal physiologic conditions, the unbound acetylcholine located in the synapse is rapidly degraded by AChE via hydrolysis, thereby terminating nerve impulses. 
Both OP and carbamate insecticides competitively bind to AChE in the plasma, RBCs, and cholinergic synapses. These agents are fat-soluble, permitting penetration of the blood–brain barrier and causing both CNS and PNS symptoms. 
OPs irreversibly bind to the catalytic active site on AChE via formation of a covalent bond between the serine on AChE and the phosphorus on the insecticide. 
When an insecticide is irreversibly bound to AChE, the enzyme cannot break down acetylcholine. This results in a high concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic clefts, which initially causes excessive stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the CNS, autonomic nervous system, and NMJ. Prolonged stimulation will cause a blockade of synaptic transmission. 
The central nicotinic receptors are of the neuronal subtype (Nn or N2); this subtype is also present in the adrenal medulla and sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia of the PNS. The peripheral nicotinic receptors (Nm or N1) are present in the NMJ. All 5 (M1 to M5) muscarinic receptor subunits are present in the CNS. Peripheral parasympathetic muscarinic innervation is postganglionic to the heart, exocrine glands, and smooth muscle, whereas sympathetic postganglionic fibers innervate the sweat glands. 
When an OP insecticide is bound to AChE, a time-dependent intramolecular reaction occurs, causing “aging.” This process involves the dealkylation of alkoxy substituent from the phosphorus atom on the insecticide, creating an “aged” conjugate. This aged conjugate forms a salt bridge with the histidine on the AChE, resulting in a strong stabilization that is resistant to hydrolysis and reactivation. The aging half-time depends on the insecticide type. 
In addition to inhibiting AChE, OP and carbamate insecticides inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in the plasma. This enzyme participates in the detoxification and metabolism processes of ester compounds, such as aspirin, physostigmine, and cocaine. BChE can hydrolyze acetylcholine, but its physiological role is minor compared with that of AChE. When it is inhibited, it does not appear to cause clinical features. Measurement of its activity can serve as a biomarker of insecticide exposure. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion and can be confirmed by reduced BChE or AChE activity in the blood. 
The results of BChE and AChE activity assays are rarely available to guide clinical decision-making. 
Labs
BChE
Some insecticides inhibit BChE more effectively than AChE. BChE activity does not relate to the severity of poisoning; however, it can be used as a sensitive marker of exposure to most cholinesterase-inhibiting compounds. 
AChE
RBC AChE activity is a good marker of synaptic function and atropine needs in a poisoned patient. Its activity is better correlated with poisoning severity than plasma cholinesterase activity. In one study, activity levels >30% corresponded to normal muscle function and no need for atropine, while activity levels <10% corresponded to grossly deranged muscle function and the need for high doses of atropine. Activity of 10%-30% was associated with a moderate impairment of muscle function and a need for atropine. 
All blood samples must be cooled as soon as they are collected. Insecticides will continue to interact with AChE if the blood sample is left at room temperature. 
Poisoning Periods
There are 3 distinct entities associated with insecticide poisoning:
Acute cholinergic syndrome
Presents with, and is diagnosed by, the muscarinic signs and symptoms described by the SLUDGE mnemonic (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastric Emesis). The Killer B’s (Bronchorrhea, Bronchospasm, Bradycardia), are also muscarinic signs, and are the immediate threats to life.
The nicotinic signs and symptoms are often recalled by the “Days of the Week” mnemonic (MTWtHF=Mydriasis, tachycardia, weakness, hypertension and fasciculations).
Intermediate Syndrome
Occurs 1-4 d after an apparent recovery from acute cholinergic syndrome but before OP-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), hence the name “intermediate syndrome.” 
Observed in ~20% of patients following oral exposure to OP insecticides. There is no clear association between the type of insecticide in the exposure and the development of the syndrome. 
Manifestations
Characteristic features of IMS include weakness of the muscles of respiration (diaphragm, intercostal muscles, accessory muscles) and of the proximal limbs. Weakness of the muscles innervated by cranial nerves may also be seen. 
The degree of severity and extent of muscle weakness vary among patients. Some only experience weakness of the neck muscles, but others may have weakness of the proximal limb muscles. Paralysis of proximal muscles can occur.
Neither upper motor neuron nor muscarinic signs and symptoms are affected. 
Consciousness is typically not affected. 
Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP)
Occurs one or more weeks after recovery from acute poisoning
Typically presentation involves polyneuropathy with painful paresthesias and ascending weakness.
Pathophysiology
Electrophysiological studies suggest that IMS is due to the downregulation of nicotinic receptors at the NMJ secondary to the accumulation of acetylcholine at the NMJ.  Figure
Management
Respiratory support: Supplemental oxygen, intubation, and mechanical ventilation as needed. 
The duration of ventilatory care required may differ considerably among patients. Patients usually need ventilatory support for 7-15 d, but some may require support for 21 d. 
Prophylactic antibiotics are usually not required unless a corresponding pneumonia develops. 
Atropine does not have a role in the management of IMS because the symptoms and clinical signs are not due to muscarinic stimulation. 
The usefulness of oximes in the treatment of IMS is uncertain. 
Prognosis
Recovery is often complete and without sequelae. 
OPIDP (Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy)
Has been clinically observed and documented for >100 y. 
In a retrospective patient cohort, OPIDP developed in 34.2% at 14-22 d post-exposure. 
Symptoms are typically observed 2-4 wk after insecticide exposure. 
Manifestations
OPIDP is characterized by cramping-type pain and paresthesia of the extremities, followed by weakness of the distal limb muscles, especially in the lower extremities. 
Consciousness is usually not affected. 
Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis has not been entirely elucidated, but this condition is suspected to be caused by the inhibition and aging of neuropathy target esterase. 
OPIDP is not a cholinergic phenomenon. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Stabilization
Decompensation frequently results from respiratory compromise; therefore, all patients must have their secretions aggressively suctioned and monitored to ensure a clear patent airway. Hemodynamics should also be monitored and augmented with IV crystalloids and vasopressors if necessary.
Atropine should be given early to patients with insecticide poisoning to reduce secretions and improve respiratory function. 
Medications
Atropine should be given without delay. A delay to atropinization can be fatal due to CNS effects and cardiovascular collapse. 
Oximes are generally recommended, but their efficacy is controversial.
Intubation
If the decision is made to intubate, succinylcholine and other depolarizing paralytics should be avoided. Several studies have reported prolonged neuromuscular blockade and apnea due to reduced succinylcholine metabolism from insecticide-inhibited AChE. 
Decontamination
Universal precautions, including the use of gloves, aprons, eye protection, and splash protection, should be used by all personnel to avoid self-contamination. 
Maximum ventilation and frequent rotation of staff reduce the exposure of healthcare personnel to the insecticide. 
Exposed patients should have all clothing removed and be thoroughly washed with soap and warm water.
GI
Although many hospitals in Asia use multiple gastric lavages for insecticide poisoning, there is no evidence that any form of gastric decontamination benefits patients poisoned with insecticides. 
If performed, gastric decontamination should only be done after the patient has been stabilized with oxygen, atropine, and an oxime. 
Ipecac-induced emesis is not recommended. Insecticide-poisoned patients may quickly become unconscious, increasing the risk of aspiration if ipecac has been administered. 
Mechanically induced emesis with large quantities of water is not recommended because of the risk of fluid pushing through the pylorus and into the small bowel and possibly increasing the rate of absorption. 
Seizures
Benzodiazepines should be given for the management of anxiety and seizures. 
Pharmacologic Agents
The U.S. maintains a strategic national stockpile of antidotes for OP poisoning (CHEMPACKs). These are held at over 1,300 locations nationwide. In a mass casualty event, these stockpiles may be used, with deployment coordinated by local authorities.
Atropine
Atropine has been the mainstay of treatment since the 1950s. 
It is a competitive non-specific postsynaptic muscarinic receptor antagonist with good CNS penetration, allowing it to be effective wherever muscarinic receptors are overstimulated by acetylcholine. 
It is important to note that atropine does not reverse nicotinic neuromuscular effects. 
Utilization decreases secretions and bronchospasm. 
The goal is to achieve atropinization, defined as sufficient atropine use to restore adequate cardiorespiratory function  and to dry the secretions.
When atropine is used, sweating will be the first sign to resolve. 
Reversal of miosis can be delayed and should not be used to guide atropine administration. 
Dosing
There is no consensus on an atropine dosing regimen. A 2004 study found 33 different proposed dosing regimens. The most common recommended regimen is doubling the last dose when a patient requires further atropine treatment. This strategy reduces the morbidity from insecticide poisoning. 
Atropinization is attained most rapidly by sequentially doubling each dose every 5 min until cardiopulmonary stability is achieved. Once achieved, an atropine infusion at 10%-20% of the dose required to achieve atropinization should be started and then titrated to the desired effect. Bolus doses of atropine can be given if symptoms return, and the infusion can be stopped and restarted at a lower rate if atropine toxicity occurs. 
This dosing regimen has been shown to reduce the mean time for atropinization from 152 to 24 min and was associated with a reduction in mortality from 22.5% to 8%. 
Target end-points 
Drying of secretions, dry axillae.
Clear chest on auscultation.
Heart rate >80 beats/min.
Systolic blood pressure >80 mm Hg.
Pupils no longer pinpoint.
It is suggested that 4 of these end-points, including all of the first 3, should be achieved before a patient can be considered atropinized.
Excessive atropine
Can be dangerous, causing antimuscarinic effects such as delirium, tachycardia, hyperthermia, ileus, and urinary retention. 
Heart rates >120 beats/min and dilated pupils are suggestive of atropine toxicity. 
Fatalities can result from atropine-induced hyperthermia and cardiac arrest. 
During the resuscitation phase of acute insecticide toxicity, caution with atropine administration and the possibility of atropine toxicity are less important. However, once successfully resuscitated, patients should not be allowed to remain in this state. 
Oxygen
Some have suggested that oxygen must be given before atropine because of the risk of inducing ventricular dysrhythmias in hypoxic patients. However, in an observational study of 1,957 patients, no evidence of a high number of early deaths was found in those receiving atropine before oxygen. 
Oxime AChE reactivators:
Oximes reactivate AChE. 
Examples of commonly used oximes include 2-PAM and obidoxime.
The effectiveness of oximes in insecticide poisoning is debatable. 
The most recent Cochrane Collaboration Review from 2011 reported that the current evidence is insufficient to indicate whether oximes are harmful or beneficial. In addition, it found that the WHO-recommended regimen (30 mg/kg pralidoxime chloride bolus followed by 8 mg/kg/h infusion) is not supported. It stated that further randomized controlled trials are needed to examine other strategies and regimens of oximes in the treatment of insecticide poisonings. 
One study showed that 2-PAM did not restore the activity of guinea pig AChE inhibited with aldicarb or methomyl (carbamates). 
Pralidoxime
Most commonly used oxime worldwide, typically as a chloride salt. 
To ensure a therapeutic concentration, a loading dose is given followed by a continuous infusion. The loading dose should not be given rapidly as a bolus because this can cause adverse effects such as vomiting, tachycardia, and diastolic hypertension. 
Dose: 30-50 mg/kg, total of 1-2 g in adults, IV over 30 min followed by a continuous infusion of 8-20 mg/kg/h (up to 650 mg/h).
Obidoxime
Developed in Germany in the 1960s.
In vitro tests of human RBC AChE reactivation showed that it is significantly more potent than pralidoxime. 
Can be hepatotoxic.
Currently recommended obidoxime loading doses of 3.5 mg/kg followed by 0.45 mg/kg/h have demonstrated no liver toxicity. 
Benzodiazepines
Seizures are a relatively uncommon complication of insecticide poisoning, but agitated delirium can develop. 
Both seizures and delirium can be successfully treated with diazepam. 
Agitation and anxiety in insecticide-poisoned patients can also be treated with benzodiazepines. 
Glycopyrrolate
Some physicians prefer using this medication because its poor CNS penetration results in fewer central anticholinergic effects. However, the poor CNS penetration also makes glycopyrrolate a poor antagonist of the central effects. A single, underpowered randomized controlled trial comparing glycopyrrolate with atropine found no difference in case fatality or need for intubation. 
Additional Considerations
Plasmapheresis
Has been documented in several case reports to improve clinical signs and symptoms. 
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and albumin
Several researchers have postulated that either recombinant human AChE or FFP that is rich in BChE may neutralize the toxic insecticide. Additionally, a study reported that albumin may “scavenge” pesticides via adsorption. 
One preliminary study from Turkey published in 2004 showed that FFP therapy increased BChE levels in patients with OP poisoning. The administration of plasma may also prevent the development of IMS and related mortality.
A pilot study published in 2010 found that despite a significant increase in pseudocholinesterase levels with FFP, there were no favorable trends in clinical outcomes with FFP or albumin. 
Anisodamine
Anisodamine is a belladonna alkaloid that has non-selective muscarinic and nicotinic receptor antagonism properties. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat cholinergic excess. As a muscarinic antagonist, it demonstrates effects similar to those of atropine and scopolamine. It is less potent than atropine and scopolamine but has fewer toxic effects than those medications. However, only limited data are available on the role of anisodamine in insecticide poisoning, and more research is needed. 
Lipid emulsion
Because some insecticides are lipid-soluble and some are formulated in lipid-soluble solvents, it has been proposed that lipid emulsion may have a therapeutic benefit. However, a study of rodents exposed to unformulated parathion showed little benefit. One case report did suggest a benefit after parathion poisoning. ",Pesticides and Cholinergics

Approach to the Critical Patient
The mainstay in any acute poisoning is a thorough assessment with contemporaneous patient stabilization (ensuring airway patency/protection, continuous cardiac monitoring), resuscitation (initiation of IV crystalloids), and supportive care.
Initiate IV sodium bicarbonate bolus and infusion; maintain serum pH 7.45-7.55.
Avoid sedatives and intubation whenever possible. If intubation is required, a high minute ventilation must be maintained to ensure serum alkalinity.
Early medical toxicology and nephrology consultations are necessary for all critically ill patients.

Key Concepts
Salicylates are found in many forms, including aspirin, oil of wintergreen, topical ointments, bismuth subsalicylate, effervescent antacids, and liniments.
Salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, impair adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and promote lipolysis.
Classic “mixed picture” acid-base disturbance: Respiratory alkalosis followed by metabolic acidosis.
The triad of hyperventilation, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, and tinnitus is rarely seen.
Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations (lethargy, seizure) portend high mortality.
Prevention of acidemia via serum alkalinization limits the formation of un-ionized salicylate that can penetrate into the CNS; urine alkalinization lessens reabsorption.
The degree of volume depletion (sensible and insensible) should not be underestimated.
Clinical status, rather than salicylate concentration alone, should guide management.
Treatment goals: “Alkalinize and dialyze.”
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: A 49-y-old woman was found at home by her daughter, confused and lying on the floor in her own vomitus. EMS were called, and during transfer, paramedics noted a declining mental status. On arrival to the ED, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score of 6 with the following vitals: temperature 39°C, heart rate 135 beats per minute, blood pressure 117/63 mm Hg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient was intubated for airway protection prior to transport for head CT scan, and labs were obtained. Upon return of the venous blood gas (VBG) (pH 7.35, pCO2 17, HCO3 10, venous excess -11) the diagnosis of salicylate poisoning was made based on this mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.
A thorough poisoning history includes toxin identification; time, route, and quantity of exposure; coingestants; and onset of any symptoms. This information should be obtained directly from the patient; however, collateral (eg, medication bottles, containers) and corroborating information from EMS, family, friends, and the electronic medical record must also be ascertained. It is equally important to determine whether the exposure was accidental or intentional.
Salicylate concentrations do not always correlate with signs and symptoms.
Therapeutic: 15-30 mg/dL
Auditory: 20-40 mg/dL
GI: >40 mg/dL
CNS: >90 mg/dL
Toxicity can be acute or chronic; chronic toxicity is associated with a higher mortality due to delayed diagnosis, underlying comorbidities, and older age.
Salicylate toxicity has no unique physical exam findings; many of the following abnormalities may be observed:
Vitals: Tachycardia, tachypnea/hyperpnea, hyperthermia (late, severe toxicity).
GI: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
CNS: Tinnitus/hearing dysfunction, coma/seizures (late, severe toxicity).
Pulmonary: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Dermatology: Diaphoresis.
Diagnostic tests: Chest radiograph.
Laboratory analysis: Salicylate concentration, arterial blood gas (ABG)/venous blood gas (VBG), BMP, lactate, prothrombin time (PT), and acetaminophen concentration.
Labs (salicylate concentration, VBG/ABG, BMP) should be repeated every 2 h until the salicylate level peaks and a trajectory of the clinical condition is ascertained.
Treatment
Oral activated charcoal
In general, administration within 1 h of ingestion may reduce absorption and lessen the tissue burden (requires alert/cooperative patient); second doses may be administered, given the propensity for bezoar formation with enteric coated products. These decisions should be made in conjunction with a medical toxicologist.
IV balanced crystalloid (plasmalyte/lactated ringers; normal saline may worsen acidosis)
IV sodium bicarbonate
Bolus: 1-2 mEq/kg.
Infusion: 150 mEq (3 amps) in 1 L D5W with 40 mEq KCl/L at 1.5-2x maintenance (note that potassium administration should only be performed after patient has urinated and demonstrated adequate renal function).
Goal serum: pH 7.5.
Goal urine: pH >7.5.
Hemodialysis
CNS involvement, worsening metabolic acidosis, rising salicylate level despite treatment, renal failure, salicylate ≥90 mg/dL (acute), salicylate ≥60 mg/dL (chronic), pulmonary edema.
Clinical status is more important than the absolute salicylate concentration, and both must be weighed regarding optimal treatment.

Background
Epidemiology
Salicylates (a willow bark derivative) have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties, all of which are mediated via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. 
Salicylates are easily obtainable in many over-the-counter formulations and combination medications.
Pathophysiology
At a physiologic serum pH, salicylic acid exists in an ionized state as a weak acid; in toxicity (acidic environment), it is converted to an un-ionized (highly permeable) state. 
ATP production is limited secondary to Krebs cycle interference. 
Energy is released in the form of heat as a result of uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. 
Renal hemodynamics are ultimately impaired, and anion gap metabolic acidosis ensues. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Toxicity is a concern for ingestion of 150 mg/kg or more. 
Enteric coated aspirin can form bezoars with erratic absorption and fluctuating salicylate concentrations. 
Acute manifestations include tachypnea, hyperpnea, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, decreased auditory acuity, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, confusion, seizures, hypoglycemia, and pulmonary edema.
Chronic manifestations include tachypnea, tinnitus, decreased auditory acuity, confusion, seizures, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema, and coagulopathy (vitamin K activity inhibition similar to that of warfarin). Compared to acute toxicity, fewer GI effects are observed, diagnosis can be delayed, and the elderly show an increased incidence. 
CNS toxicity correlates well with mortality; salicylates rapidly distribute into the CNS as the pH decreases. 
Salicylates are potent respiratory stimulants, acting on the medullary respiratory neurons, even at therapeutic concentrations.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 7% of cases in 1 study, indicating severe toxicity. 
Laboratory Data
Electrolytes/lactate
The metabolism of salicylates causes an increase in the anion gap. Salicylate is the primary unmeasured anion; however, lactic acid is also produced from anaerobic metabolism, which contributes to the anion gap.
Many chemistry analyzers report a false elevation of chloride in the setting of salicylate toxicity, which can skew the anion gap. 
Blood gas (venous/arterial)
Primary respiratory alkalosis followed by a mixed acid-base disorder (respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis).
Salicylate concentration
Always obtain pH in addition to salicylate concentrations. Note that if both are decreasing, this can herald a worsening clinical status as the salicylate moves into tissues.
Always treat patients based on clinical status, as there can be a poor correlation between salicylate concentration and toxicity. 
The Done nomogram is antiquated and should never be used.
Therapeutic Considerations
Avoid sedation and intubation if possible, as these procedures can blunt respiratory drive, worsen acidemia, and increase un-ionized CNS salicylate distribution.
Consider intubation in cases of deteriorating mental status, acute lung injury, or uncontrollable agitation.
If intubating, maintain or exceed minute ventilation requirements, pursue aggressive bag-valve mask procedures (delayed sequence intubation if possible), administer 2 mEq/kg IV bolus sodium bicarbonate, and consider administering 1 ampule D50 IV immediately before sedation (to prevent unrecognized neuroglycopenia, a sinister complication of salicylate toxicity).
Consider activated charcoal if there are no contraindications. A 10:1 ratio of activated charcoal to ingested salicylate has been recommended.  Consider multiple doses of activated charcoal if salicylate concentrations are rising, as this finding indicates ongoing, prolonged systemic absorption.
Administer bolus isotonic fluids and provide adequate hydration; profound sensible (eg, vomiting) and insensible (eg, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, respiratory effort) losses are often underappreciated.  Forced diuresis is not recommended.
Sodium bicarbonate prevents worsening acidosis and, therefore, tissue distribution both by maintaining salicylate in ionized form and limiting renal reabsorption (“ion trapping”).
Maintain K+ ≥4.5 mg/dL (hypokalemia can limit urinary alkalinization).
Serum glucose may be normal despite a low CNS glucose (eg, neuroglycopenia).
Maintain serum glucose concentrations at high-normal, especially for patients with altered mental status.
Hemodialysis should be considered in any of the following cases: 
Acute ingestion: Serum concentration >90 mg/dL
Chronic ingestion: Serum concentration >60 mg/dL

Approach to the Critical Patient
Critical to the management of any acute poisoning is a thorough patient assessment with concurrent stabilization (ensuring airway patency/protection, continuous cardiac monitoring), resuscitation (initiation of intravenous crystalloids) and supportive care.
Ciguatoxin, saxitoxin, or tetrodotoxin poisoning may result in paralysis that requires intubation. Provide traditional supportive ventilatory support, including intubation if needed.
Scombroid, domoic acid and urchin ingestion may result in hypotension.
Provide traditional supportive care for hemodynamic instability, including IV fluids and vasopressors if needed.
Key Concepts
“Red tide” refers to the overgrowth of naturally occurring algae colonies.
Healthy mollusks (mussels, clams, oysters, scallops) filter large quantities of algae.
Mollusks can therefore accumulate the toxins produced by these algae.
Toxin Classification
Algal: toxins become super-concentrated from being passed through the food chain
Ciguatoxin
Bioaccumulation from the dinoflagellates of reef fish
Examples: barracuda, grouper, sea bass, snapper
Heat stable - toxins are not broken down when cooked
Shellfish toxins
Paralytic shellfish poisoning: saxitoxin
Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning: brevetoxin
Amnesic shellfish poisoning: domoic acid
Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning: okadaic acid
Bacterial: toxins result from bacteria found on or in fish
Scombrotoxin
Histidine is converted to histamine by bacteria that break down fish flesh.
Examples: mackerel, tuna, swordfish, mahi mahi, bonito
Tetrodotoxin
Symbiotic bacteria found in globe fish, balloon fish, blowfish, toad fish, blue ringed octopus, and mollusks.
Heat stable - toxins are not broken down when cooked.
Biologic: toxins that naturally occur in the organism
Red whelk poisoning
Contains tetramine
Sea urchin poisoning
Contains acetylcholine
Environmental: toxins produced by chemical contaminants
Key Diagnostic Elements
The diagnosis of seafood toxin poisoning is primarily made based on a history and physical exam. Tests have limited value, especially during the acute period.
Common presenting scenarios:
Ciguatoxin: within 24 h of eating grouper at a local fish market, a patient develops orthostatic hypotension, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, paresthesias, hot/cold reversal, metallic taste, itching and a feeling of loose teeth.
Saxitoxin: after winning an all-you-can-eat oyster competition, a patient develops paresthesias (especially in the mouth and extremities) followed by bulbar and then generalized weakness. Within 12 h the patient is intubated for respiratory failure. The patient’s strength takes several weeks to return to baseline.
Brevetoxin: after fine dining on clams, a patient develops nausea, rectal burning, vomiting, myalgias, paresthesias and hot/cold reversal. An uncommon combination of bradycardia and mydriasis can also be observed.
Domoic acid: 4 h after eating shellfish while on a Canadian vacation, a couple develops nausea and vomiting with occasional preventricular contractions seen on cardiac monitoring. They do not remember their dinner or their hospital stay.
Scombroid: while enjoying a mahi mahi steak, a patient develops facial and upper torso flushing, a burning sensation in his mouth and abdomen, diffuse urticaria, and pruritus.
Tetrodotoxin: while vacationing in Japan, an adventurous couple develops nausea, vomiting and ascending paralysis that results in respiratory failure within 30 min.

Background
Epidemiology
The total number of seafood-related poisonings worldwide per year is unknown. This is largely due to the under-reporting or misdiagnosis of seafood poisonings as other disease processes (eg, misdiagnosing scombroid toxicity as an allergic reaction). Attempts to quantify seafood toxin exposures report widely variable statistics. For example, worldwide estimates of ciguatoxin poisoning are between 20,000 and 500,000 per year. 
Specific seafood toxins predominate in given geographic regions. Given the global distribution of fish and shellfish, seafood toxicity has been diagnosed outside of the source fish’s normal habitat. 
Ciguatoxin is found in tropical waters between 10 degrees north and 10 degrees south of the equator. Over 500 reef fish have been implicated in ciguatera poisoning, with the most common being Spanish mackerel, barracuda, sea bass, grouper, and tuna. 
Ciguatera toxicity is the result of the bioaccumulation of ciguatoxin through the food chain. Dinoflagellates are eaten by small reef fish that are then eaten by larger reef fish. This results in an increased concentration of 1 or more of the 40 known ciguatoxins. Bioaccumulation in the United States most often occurs in the warmer months between May and August. Florida and Hawaii, states that are both known for their reefs, have the highest number of affected patients.  Gastrointestinal symptoms are the predominant presenting symptoms of ciguatera poisoning in the Caribbean, while neurologic symptoms predominate in the Pacific. 
Ciguatoxins are a group of over 40 different toxins. They are large, lipophilic, heat stable molecules that are odorless and tasteless.  Cooking at high temperatures or freezing during transport does not break down the toxin.
Ciguatoxins act by opening voltage-gated sodium channels, which leads to a cascade of physiologic actions that result in toxicity. Neurologic symptoms are due to direct neuronal cell membrane depolarization and Schwann cell swelling, which can lead to reduced nerve conduction speeds.  Gastrointestinal symptoms are caused by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels in the intestinal epithelium, which causes an influx of calcium.  This loss of ion homeostasis leads to fluid shifts that result in diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Several other cellular mechanisms specific to a given ciguatoxin have been proposed.
Scombroid is the most commonly reported seafood toxicity in the United States.  Largely found in the family Scombridae (including mackerel, tuna, bonito, etc.), scombroid toxin can also be found in large open water fish such as swordfish. It is distributed throughout both warm and cold bodies of water.
Scombroid poisoning results from the consumption of fish that contain high amounts of histidine and were improperly stored.  Colonizing bacteria that are most prominent in the intestines and the skin break down histidine to histamine.  When ingested, histamine agonism occurs at multiple histamine receptors. Typical symptoms usually start within 1 h of ingestion and may include hives, pruritus, flushing, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and bronchospasm.  Symptoms are generally self limited, and resolve within 24 h. Many reported cases of allergic reactions to fish may actually be scombroid toxicity.
Brevetoxin, saxitoxin, and domoic acid are produced by dinoflagellates that bioaccumulate in shellfish. Large algae blooms such as “red tide” can significantly increase the risk of toxicity, even when shellfish are eaten after these bloom events are over. 
Brevetoxin is a sodium channel opener that results in neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. Ciguatoxin and brevetoxin are both heat-stable and present with similar symptoms.
Saxitoxin is a potent neurotoxin. It reversibly inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, which results in paralytic shellfish poisoning. The onset can be within a few min of ingestion, and leads to flaccid paralysis while the patient is still conscious.  Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, paresthesias, and myalgias. Tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin poisoning can be very difficult to differentiate.
Domoic acid is a kainic acid analog that excites the glutamate receptors in the brain. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headaches, seizures, coma, and potentially death. Glutamate receptors in the hippocampus and amygdala are particularly sensitive to domoic acid, which results in neuronal cell death. Several cases of short-term memory loss following exposure to domoic acid are thought to be from this mechanism.  Outbreaks in humans are rare, with the most famous being Prince Edward Island in Canada in 1987 from blue oysters. Over 100 people became symptomatic, and several required admission to the ICU. Three deaths were reported. Many wildlife outbreaks linked to odd animal behavior have been reported, most notably seabirds attacking people in Capitola, California in 1961. This event is thought to have influenced Alfred Hitchcock’s movie “The Birds.” 
Tetrodotoxin is a very potent neurotoxin most famously found in pufferfish. Eating “fugu,” a Japanese pufferfish delicacy, has resulted in a number of deaths. This has led to regulations regarding fugu preparation from the Japanese government. Poisonings from eating pufferfish have occurred in other areas of the world, including the U.S. At present, only one company, Wako Importers in New York, can legally import pufferfish into the United States as a result of tetrodotoxin fatalities in the U.S.
Tetrodotoxin is also found in a variety of unrelated animals, including but not limited to several starfish, several species of blue ring octopus, newts, salamanders, the Indo-Pacific goby, and horseshoe crab. Some theories as to why tetrodotoxin is found in such a diverse set of animals include bioaccumulation from toxic algae, symbiotic bacteria that produce tetrodotoxin, and the development of tetrodotoxin-secreting exocrine glands during parallel evolutionary periods.
Tetrodotoxin blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to rapidly progressive skeletal muscle paralysis. Slow muscle fibers are more prone to toxicity than fast muscle fibers, making the diaphragm and vascular smooth muscle particularly sensitive to tetrodotoxin-induced paralysis. Due to vascular smooth muscle relaxation, hypotension along with paralysis is a common presentation. The time of onset and the constellation of symptoms is dose-dependent. Fugu-accredited sushi chefs occasionally attempt to elicit perioral paresthesias for their clients using specific cuts of fugu as a delicacy in Japan. 
The symptoms of tetrodotoxin poisoning can vary widely and are based on the exposure route and the dose received. More common symptoms include perioral paresthesias, general paresthesias, severe weakness, dysphagia, hypotension, bradycardia, miosis followed by mydriasis, incontinence, nausea, vomiting, coma, and death. Symptoms generally begin within 10 min of consumption, but can be delayed by several hours.
Diagnostic Considerations
Seafood poisoning is largely a clinical diagnosis that is based on the presenting symptoms and a history of ingesting seafood. Knowing the specific seafood eaten and matching them with the patient’s symptoms can help delineate the type of toxin exposure. The time of year and geography can further help with the diagnosis, but may not always be helpful. For example, frozen grouper eaten in Michigan during the winter may still cause ciguatera toxicity if the toxin is present in a fish caught in tropical waters during the summer.
Differentiating between specific seafood poisoning syndromes can be difficult, as many symptoms can overlap.
Ciguatera and brevetoxin toxicity can be very difficult to differentiate as the mechanism of these toxins is the same. Gastrointestinal symptoms predominate in the first 12 h after exposure, and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Dehydration is common. These are typically self-limiting but may last as long as 4 d. Neurologic symptoms appear within the first 24 h. They include paresthesias, headaches, hot/cold sensation reversal, the feeling of loose or painful teeth, and weakness. Seizures and vertigo are rare but do occur. The differentiator despite similar symptoms is the ingestion of either reef fish (ciguatoxin) or shellfish (brevetoxin), although a meal that includes both may make the diagnosis impossible. An immunoassay does exist but is not readily available clinically.
Scombroid toxicity should be considered in any patient that presents with symptoms similar to an allergic reaction after eating part of a large fish. Multiple patients with similar symptoms is highly suggestive of scombroid poisoning. Symptomatic patients previously exposed to the same species of fish without previous symptoms is suggestive but not definitive of scombroid toxicity.
Suspected scombroid toxicity should result in a call to the local poison center or public health department, as they may know about other cases in the area. Testing can be performed on the fish to determine if histamine concentrations are above acceptable limits. This is not likely to be beneficial in the emergency setting but can help guide public health efforts.
Saxitoxin and domoic acid should be considered in the right clinical context in patients seen several hours after ingesting shellfish. No testing is available.
Tetrodotoxin should be considered in any patient who presents with rapidly progressing paralysis after eating sushi or any other appropriate clinical context. Tetrodotoxin poisoning can be a difficult diagnosis to make, as some cases involve unknown sushi tainted with tetrodotoxin. Other cases resulted from blue ringed octopus venom without evidence of a bite wound. Children playing in tide pools in the Indo-Pacific region are particularly vulnerable, and may not be able to describe what bit them.
Laboratory testing is not helpful in the diagnosis of tetrodotoxin poisoning. Electrolyte levels should be assessed due to toxin-induced diarrhea or vomiting, which may lead to electrolyte abnormalities.
Therapeutic Considerations
The mainstay of the treatment of seafood toxins is largely supportive.
As with all emergency department patients, the ABC’s must be assessed.
Those presenting with paralysis may require intubation. It is important to understand that patients are fully aware during this event, and therefore appropriate sedation medications should be used.
Ciguatoxin, scombroid, tetrodotoxin, and brevetoxin may cause hypotension and/or bradycardia. Intravenous fluids and vasoactive agents such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine may be required for blood pressure support. Bradycardia may respond to atropine, but is not generally necessary if the patient’s blood pressure can be maintained.
Case reports have suggested that amitriptyline, nifedipine, fluoxetine, and/or gabapentin may be beneficial in the treatment of some of the symptoms of ciguatera toxicity, although the evidence for this is limited.
Mannitol has been proposed as a way to decrease neuronal swelling and inhibit the effects of the ciguatera toxin. Its use has also been proposed for the treatment of the ciguatera toxin’s neurotoxic effects, but not its gastrointestinal effects. A small randomized controlled trial of 50 patients showed that mannitol may not be superior to normal saline, although some controversy remains about the blinding and subanalysis protocols used in this study.  At this time, mannitol is not recommended for the treatment of ciguatera toxicity.
Scombroid toxicity may be treated with H1 antagonists (diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, etc.) and/or H2 antagonists (famotidine, cimetidine, ranitidine). More severe toxin-mediated effects should be treated in a similar manner to anaphylaxis using intramuscular epinephrine, glucocorticoids, intravenous fluids, and/or bronchodilators.  Antiemetics may benefit those with nausea or vomiting. Patients with a severe reaction should avoid seafood and follow up with an allergist or primary care doctor for testing prior to eating seafood again to determine if a potential allergy exists.
None of the seafood toxins have known antidotes. Decontamination is theoretically beneficial, but has not been shown to be more effective than supportive care.
Patients with persistent symptoms that require ongoing interventions such as vasopressors or intravenous fluids for hypotension, intubation for respiratory failure, or close cardiac monitoring for bradycardia or an irregular heart rhythm should be admitted to the medical intensive care unit for close monitoring.",Seafood Toxins
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
In any acute poisoning case, a thorough assessment is essential, with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care.
All sedated patients require continuous cardiopulmonary and capnography monitoring.
While obtaining vitals, blood glucose and ECG should also be obtained.
Initial stabilization in sedative-hypnotic poisoning should focus on airway and breathing because central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression predominate. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary (eg, hypoxia, hypercapnia, high risk of aspiration, not tolerating secretions).
Begin IV crystalloids for hypotension.
Flumazenil 0.2 mg IV should be given for benzodiazepine overdose (if no contraindications), and 0.2 mg IV dose may be repeated as needed to a maximum total dose of 1 mg.
Esmolol is the treatment of choice for cardiac dysrhythmias associated with chloral hydrate.

Key Concepts
Sedative-hypnotics represent a broad group of medications, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, non-benzodiazepine γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor agonists, certain muscle relaxants, and others.
Sedative-hypnotic overdose should be considered in patients with CNS depression; in most instances, respiratory depression coincides with the CNS depression.
The diagnosis is based on a history of ingestion because the clinical manifestations are non-specific.
Large overdoses may cause hypothermia and the appearance of brain death.
Most fatalities from benzodiazepines occur in the setting of a co-ingestant.
Key Diagnostic Elements
The most common clinical manifestation is CNS depression.
Certain medications, such as barbiturates, may mimic ethanol intoxication, with slurred speech and incoordination.
Alternate causes of altered mental status must be considered unless history clearly points toward toxic ingestion.
Minimal laboratory testing for the undifferentiated patient with CNS and/or respiratory depression should include blood gas, CBC, CMP, and consideration for head CT with or without lumbar puncture (on a case-by-case basis).
Concentrations of certain agents such as ethanol or phenobarbital are helpful, especially if a specific toxin is suspected.
In cases of suspected intentional overdose, consider additional levels such as acetaminophen and salicylate.
Routine urine drug screening is typically not helpful except for pediatric patients.
Treatment
Focus on monitoring and maintaining adequate airway and hemodynamic support.
Hypotension should be treated with IV crystalloids.
Chloral hydrate toxicity can cause cardiac dysrhythmias; beta-adrenergic antagonists are the treatment of choice.
Gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) may be considered if a patient presents early following the overdose and is not at risk for aspiration. Multi-dose AC (MDAC) may be useful in a phenobarbital overdose by enhancing elimination.
Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, will reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine GABA-receptor agonists, such as zolpidem.
Flumazenil 0.2 mg IV over 15 s; if there is no response after 45 s, may repeat at doses of 0.2 mg IV to a maximum total dose of 1 mg.
Contraindications to flumazenil: Seizure disorder or concomitant ingestion of a proconvulsant medication; chronic use of benzodiazepines should not be considered an absolute contraindication.

Background
Sedative-hypnotics are widely prescribed to aid with anxiety and sleep. The primary mechanism of action is via CNS depression.
Epidemiology
Sedative-hypnotics are a common medication class implicated in intentional and unintentional overdoses reported to U.S. poison centers. In 2017, they were among the top 5 classes of medications involved in all human exposures reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, with nearly 150,000 cases. 
Sedative-hypnotics are associated with the largest number of fatalities compared to all other classes of medications and are a leading cause of death from medication overdose in pregnant and pediatric patients. 
Benzodiazepine prescriptions and overdose deaths have increased considerably over the past decade. Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults who filled a benzodiazepine prescription increased by 67%. The number of deaths due to benzodiazepine overdose increased 4-fold. 
Although both benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine GABA-receptor agonists are listed on the American Geriatric Society Beers list of medications to avoid in the elderly, 6.1% of men and 10.8% of women in this age group use benzodiazepines. The highest rate of use (11.9%) is among 80-y-old women.  The elderly are at an increased risk of adverse drug reactions such as confusion, falls, fractures, and mortality due to polypharmacy and physiologic changes that occur with aging.
Concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of fatal and non-fatal overdose, with the risk being highest during the first days of concomitant use. 
Pathophysiology
Most sedative-hypnotics cause CNS depression by enhancing the effects of GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.
GABA is synthesized from glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, via the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. This process is pyridoxine (vitamin B6)-dependent. Isoniazid disrupts the activation of pyridoxine, leading to an excess of glutamate and a deficiency of GABA, resulting in refractory seizures.
There are two main GABA receptors in the CNS: GABAA receptors, which are Cl− channels, and GABAB receptors, which are G-protein-linked. 
The majority of commonly used sedative/hypnotics, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ethanol, propofol, etomidate, and chloral hydrate, are GABAA agonists.
Benzodiazepines are one of the most common classes of psychoactive drugs. They exert their effects by enhancing the effect of GABA at the GABAA receptor, causing sedative, anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. 
Zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon, commonly referred to as the “Z-drugs,” are structurally unrelated to benzodiazepines but bind to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. They have a shorter duration of action and do not affect other sites on the GABAA receptor that mediate anticonvulsant or anxiolytic effects. 
Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and related analogs are popular drugs of abuse used for their euphoric, anabolic, sedative, and amnestic properties. GHB is both a precursor and a degradation product of GABA and can produce coma with recreational use.
Baclofen and GHB are GABAB agonists. Withdrawal from these agents presents similarly to ethanol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, with seizures and CNS excitation; however, treatment can be problematic because the majority of medications used for treatment are GABAA receptor agonists.
Some sedative-hypnotics act on receptors other than GABA receptors.
Dexmedetomidine is a central α2-adrenergic agonist that is used for sedation in critically ill patients and is thought to improve a patient’s ability to communicate compared with other sedating medications. 
Chloral hydrate is a halogenated hydrocarbon that has been used in clinical practice since the 1800s. It is most commonly used today for sedation in pediatric patients. The mechanism of CNS depression arises through interaction with the GABA complex. Chloral hydrate is metabolized in the same manner as ethanol by hepatic alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase to trichloroethanol, the active metabolite responsible for its sedative properties. The combination of chloral hydrate and ethanol may lead to decreased elimination of ethanol and prolonged CNS depression. 
Melatonin and ramelteon, a synthetic melatonin analog, regulate circadian rhythms via agonism of MT1 and MT2 receptors. 
Although most sedative-hypnotics are rapidly absorbed from the GI tract, the pharmacokinetics are diverse. Some substances are short-acting, such as the barbiturate methohexital, and others are long-acting, such as phenobarbital.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The primary clinical symptom in sedative-hypnotic overdose is CNS depression.
Patients typically exhibit slurred speech, ataxia, and incoordination, followed by stupor and coma.
Respiratory depression and bradypnea may occur but are not always present, even in the comatose patient. Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur when an overdose involves a combination of sedative-hypnotic drugs or medications, such as ethanol and benzodiazepines.
The physical exam is typically non-specific, with key clinical findings not uniformly present. In addition to CNS depression, the following clinical findings may be observed with specific agents:
GHB has a low therapeutic index and is a significant cause of drug-induced coma with associated bradycardia, hypothermia, myoclonus, and respiratory depression. 
Barbiturate overdose may lead to hypothermia. Although not specific to barbiturates, bullous eruptions over pressure points known as “barb-blisters” have been described. These have also been observed in other causes of profound sedation or other sedative-hypnotic overdoses from pressure-induced local ischemia. 
Overdose of “Z-drugs” principally causes somnolence, with recovery expected within 6 h due to the short half-life of these drugs. Bizarre behavior and next-day memory and cognition impairment may occur. 
Chloral hydrate may cause ventricular dysrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia, by sensitizing the heart to circulating catecholamines. This is the proposed mechanism in “sudden sniffing death,” a phenomenon of sudden cardiac arrest in individuals who abuse halogenated hydrocarbons to achieve euphoria and experience a sudden stressor.  Chloral hydrate is also a GI irritant; vomiting and hemorrhagic gastritis have been observed.
Carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant that has been abused for its anxiolytic properties.  Carisoprodol is metabolized to the active metabolite meprobamate, which has a mechanism similar to that of barbiturates. Bezoar formation, causing delayed drug release and cyclical coma, and myocardial depression have been observed with carisoprodol/meprobamate ingestions. Dependence and withdrawal have been reported with chronic carisoprodol use. 
Laboratory Evaluation
All patients with altered mental status should have a finger-stick glucose test performed promptly upon arrival.
All patients with suspected drug overdose should have their serum acetaminophen level checked. Other potentially helpful laboratory tests in the undifferentiated sedated patient include serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, ethanol level, ammonia level, and consideration for a CT scan of the head with or without lumbar puncture if clinically warranted.
With the exception of phenobarbital, most sedative-hypnotic drug concentrations are not readily available in hospital laboratories.
Rapid urine drug-of-abuse screening (UDS) is rarely helpful unless used in the management of a pediatric patient. The UDS is an immunoassay and is subject to both false-positive and false-negative results. Most sedative-hypnotics, including many benzodiazepines, are not detected by the UDS.  Furthermore, the presence of a substance is not proof of recent use. Agents with long half-lives (eg, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) can be detected in the urine up to 30 d after ingestion. 
Radiographic Evaluation
The majority of sedative-hypnotics will not be detected on an abdominal radiograph. The exception is chloral hydrate, which may be radiopaque. Routine abdominal imaging is not recommended, because the absence of visualized pills does not rule out an ingestion.
Therapeutic Considerations
The focus of management should be on supporting the patient’s airway, providing hemodynamic support, and preventing aspiration. IV crystalloid should be used for hypotension. The use of vasopressors is rarely indicated in a pure sedative-hypnotic overdose.
GI decontamination: AC may be considered in patients presenting within 1-2 h of ingestion and not at risk for aspiration (active vomiting, sedation, and/or seizures). MDAC may be considered for life-threatening overdoses of phenobarbital.  MDAC has been demonstrated to increase the elimination of phenobarbital by creating a concentration gradient between the blood and GI tract, a concept called “gut dialysis.”
Urine alkalinization: Alkalinization of the urine with sodium bicarbonate to a pH of 7.5-8.0 increases the excretion of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital has a pKa of 7.2 and is a weak acid. An alkaline urine charges the phenobarbital and enhances elimination by “ion trapping.” This treatment is not effective for other barbiturates.  Urine alkalinization can be achieved with IV administration of 1-2 mEq/kg sodium bicarbonate followed by an infusion of 150 mEq in 1 L of 5% dextrose in water (D5W) at 150-200 mL/h. The patient’s acid-base status needs to be closely monitored, and the systemic pH should not rise above 7.55 to prevent other adverse effects on the body. Serum electrolytes, especially potassium, need to be closely monitored. 
Antidote: Flumazenil competitively antagonizes the effects of benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor. Flumazenil can be used both diagnostically and therapeutically in suspected benzodiazepine overdose and also reverses the effects of the “Z-drugs.”  Flumazenil has a rapid onset of action and a high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor. It will not reverse the effects of other sedative-hypnotics such as barbiturates or other sedatives such as ethanol. Flumazenil is administered parenterally at a dose of 0.2 mg IV every 1-2 min up to 1 mg. The main contraindications to flumazenil use are seizure disorder or known ingestion of a proconvulsant drug. Although rare, seizures are the most common adverse event and typically occur in multi-drug ingestions with a proconvulsant drug. 
Hemodialysis is generally of limited utility for most sedative-hypnotics because these agents are lipophilic compounds that are highly protein-bound with minimal renal elimination. Several case reports have described the use of hemodialysis in phenobarbital overdose; it may decrease the length of intubation time and critical care stay in significant overdoses. 
The duration of monitoring depends on the clinical status of the patient. Most asymptomatic patients may be safely discharged from the ED after a period of 4-6 h of observation. Exceptions include ingestion of long-acting substances such as clonazepam, carisoprodol ingestion, or polysubstance ingestions, where synergistic effects on the CNS and respiratory system may occur.",Sedatives/Hypnotics

Textbook presentation
Pit viper envenomation: A 25-y-old woman feels a sharp pain after stepping over a log while hiking near her house but does not see what caused the pain. She immediately heads home due to worsening pain and swelling of her calf. When she arrives at the emergency department (ED), she has significant swelling, pain, and bruising at her calf extending past her knee. Her platelet count is “low.” Interpreting the condition as a snake bite, the physician administers antivenom and pain medications, with some improvement of her symptoms.
Coral snake envenomation: While picking up a brightly colored “king snake” in Florida, a 15-y-old boy is bitten. Not thinking much of it, his friends notice that the boy begins to appear tired and have difficulty speaking. On arrival to the ED, the patient is unable to swallow and has a NIF of 25 mm Hg. He does not improve despite receiving 5 vials of antivenom.

"Deep Dive
Epidemiology
There are approximately 5,000-9,000 snake bites per year in the U.S. 
The vast majority of snake bites are due to pit vipers.
The majority of pit viper bites are due to copperheads. 
Pit viper bites comprise the majority of U.S. snake bite deaths per year, which number in the single digits.
Approximately ~80 coral snake envenomations are reported to Poison Control per year in the U.S.
Despite a highly potent neurotoxin, deaths are rare. 
There are ~100 exotic bites per year in the U.S. Deaths are rare, but have been reported.
Historically, it was thought that men accounted for the majority of envenomations in the U.S.; however, newer data show that bites may be more equally distributed among men and women. 
Women tend to be bitten on the lower extremity.
Men and children are much more likely to be bitten on the upper extremity.
Men are most likely to experience a severe envenomation.
Pathophysiology
Crotaline snakes have large, diamond-shaped heads with elliptical pupils.
Pits located between the eyes and nostrils are heat-sensing organs, which can sense temperature differences of 0.02°C, resulting in the term “pit vipers.”
Large, hinged hollow front fangs deliver venom from glands located just behind the eyes.
The combination of mechanical pressure from the bite and smooth muscles surrounding the venom glands causes the venom to be expelled through the distal tips of the front fangs.
Crotaline venom varies by species, geography, local diet, and size of the snake.  More than 100 distinct enzymes have been classified.
The medically relevant enzyme groups include snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs), and phospholipase A2 (PLA2).
SVMPs utilize metal ions (usually zinc) to cause local inflammation and hematologic effects.
Local inflammation can be a result of either direct tissue toxicity and/or damage to the vascular endothelium, causing extravasation and bleeding in the local tissue.
Hematologic effects include thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy, increasing the likelihood of systemic bleeding. 
SVSPs generally affect the hematologic system via effects on the coagulation cascade, fibrinolytic system, complement system, endothelial cells, platelet function, and kallikrein-kinin system.
Despite the wide variety of mechanisms in this class, the general clinical outcome is increased risk of local bleeding resulting in swelling and ecchymosis and/or an increased risk of systemic bleeding due to coagulopathy. 
PLA2s can cause an array of local, hematologic, systemic, and neurotoxic clinical effects.
A notable specific toxin is the Mojave toxin of Crotalus scutulatus (Mojave green rattlesnake). Mojave toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine, causing flaccid paralysis. 
Other important enzyme classes include cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), C-type lectin-like proteins (CLPs), bradykinin potentiating proteins (BPPs), and disintegrins.
CRISPs have been found in several species of rattlesnakes; however, their specific function is unknown. In vitro models have shown proteolytic activity and ion channel inhibition similar to that of PLA2s. 
CLPs affect the hematologic system. They can have procoagulant and/or anticoagulant effects, causing an increased risk of local or systemic bleeding. 
BPPs cause hypotension through direct and indirect vasodilatory effects.
The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was developed using a BPP from Bothrops jararaca, a pit viper found in South America. 
Disintegrins found in rattlesnake venom inhibit platelet aggregation by binding GPIIbIIIa, resulting in an increased risk of bleeding. 
The composition of pit viper venom and the physiologic function of a specific toxin can vary widely within the same species of snake, depending on geographic location, age of the snake, and local prey. 
Specific species may be known to produce a specific toxin.
Example: Mojave rattlesnake producing Mojave toxin
The clinical effects of a single toxin can vary from local to severe, depending on the geographic location of the snake.
Envenomation effects due to Crotalus horridus, also known as the timber rattlesnake, range from purely local reactions to thrombocytopenia and flaccid paralysis.
Coral snakes are smaller, brightly colored snakes. In the U.S., their pattern consists of red, yellow, black, yellow.
Non-venomous snakes such as the scarlet king snake and milk snake mimic their red, black, and yellow coloration.
Envenomations have occurred due to misidentification of a snake believed to be non-venomous due to morphologic color variations.
Coral snakes have smaller heads compared to pit vipers and have small fixed front fangs that deliver venom from venom glands located posteriorly behind the eyes.
A coral snake will often chew when biting.
It is a misconception that coral snakes need to chew in order to cause an envenomation.
Fang marks may or may not be present at the envenomation site.
Coral snake venom is complex and poorly understood.
The most clinically significant components are PLA2s.
PLA2s are the primary component responsible for the paralysis observed in coral snake bites.
The known PLA2s of coral snakes cause presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition of neurons.
The prolonged paralysis from neuronal damage and non-reversible paralysis despite antivenom treatment suggest that the majority of the effects are presynaptic. 
Other likely significant components include three-finger toxins, metalloproteinases, acetylcholinesterases, serine proteases, hyaluronidase, and calcium and potassium channel inhibitors. 
Three-finger toxins inhibit acetylcholine (ACh) from binding to nicotinic postsynaptic terminals. 
The inhibition of the presynaptic release of ACh and postsynaptic binding of ACh at nicotinic receptors causing flaccid paralysis is clinically similar to the action of other toxins, such as botulism.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
Identification of the snake may be beneficial but is unnecessary, as treatment is based on clinical symptoms and not the specific snake involved.
Capturing the snake, either live or dead, may be harmful to the snake and puts the patient at further risk. Even when dead, a snake may bite and inject venom due to reflexes that can last several days. Several envenomations occur each year from snakes thought to be dead.
A cell phone picture taken from a safe distance is adequate for identification.
Crotaline Envenomation
Typically, but not always, patients present knowing that they have been bitten by a snake. Children may not be able to communicate that they have been bitten.
Some patients will present within a few minutes of a bite without any signs or symptoms.
An envenomated patient can take up to 12 h to show signs or symptoms. 
The patient should be closely monitored for local or systemic symptoms of envenomation and/or coagulopathy for 8-12 h. Baseline labs should be obtained.
If there are no signs of envenomation or evidence of lab abnormalities after 8-12 h, the patient can be discharged. Strict return precautions should be discussed, as rare but anecdotal cases of symptoms occurring after up to 48 h have been documented.
Approximately 20%-25% of recorded bites from venomous snakes are considered “dry bites,” in which no venom is deposited. These patients should be monitored as discussed above. 
Initial signs of envenomation can include a puncture wound and/or scratch followed by pain, swelling, and/or paresthesias near the bite site.
Local tissue effects include severe pain, swelling contiguous from the bite site, ecchymosis, fasciculations, and/or paresthesias.
The leading edge of tenderness often precedes swelling or ecchymosis, and the progression of tenderness is an indicator of worsening envenomation.
Hematologic effects may include bleeding at the puncture site, local bleeding causing hemorrhagic blebs, hypofibrinogenemia, coagulopathy resulting in an elevated INR, and/or thrombocytopenia.
Neurotoxic effects include local paresthesias, perioral paresthesias, fasciculations, and paralysis. Seizures have been reported but are more likely due to hypotension and/or hypoperfusion rather than as a direct venom effect.
In rare cases, other systemic symptoms, including hypotension and angioedema, may occur, which may be venom-induced or an anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction to exogenous proteins in the venom or snake saliva.
Compartment syndrome has been documented but is rare.
The large degree of local edema can cause severe pain, difficulty in ranging fingers or toes, sensory changes, and difficulty finding a pulse.
Swelling is often limited to subcutaneous tissue and usually does not extend to the intrafascial compartments.
Clinically, it can be difficult to differentiate between compartment syndrome and a severe local envenomation.
Coral Snake Envenomation
The history usually provides the diagnosis. Often, the history will include handling a brightly colored red, yellow, and black snake.
Several species of king and milk snakes have similar color patterns, leading to a false reassurance that the snake is safe to handle.
The rhyme “red touch yellow, kill a fellow, red touch black, venom lack” has been used to identify the different color patterns of non-venomous snakes that mimic coral snakes and venomous coral snakes.
While this rhyme is generally true, morphologic color variants do occur, which may lead to an envenomation.
Fang marks, abrasions, and/or local swelling may not always be present.
Micrurus tenere (Texas coral snake) is well known to cause severe local pain and paresthesias.
Most patients bitten by Micrurus fulvius (Florida coral snake) present as asymptomatic or with minimal local symptoms.
Neurologic symptoms can progress over the next several hours.
Patients can be asymptomatic for up to 13 h after envenomation. 
Typically, cranial nerves are affected first. Ptosis, diplopia, dysphonia, dysarthria, and difficulty swallowing may be present.
Progression of symptoms can lead to paralysis of the respiratory and skeletal muscles. Incomplete paralysis can occur.
Paralysis can last up to 2 months.
Aspiration pneumonia is a known complication due to the inability to appropriately protect the airway.
The patient’s mental status is unaffected despite paralysis.
Tests
Crotaline Envenomation
Laboratory evaluation should include a CBC, fibrinogen level, and coagulation studies to assess for thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy.
In the setting of shock, other lab tests such as LFTs, electrolytes, and renal function tests should be considered.
A creatine kinase test may be considered if there is suspicion of compartment syndrome. 
Coral Snake Envenomation
No specific labs are indicated.
A chest x-ray should be considered for all patients with neurologic symptoms to assess for aspiration.
A measure of NIF should be ordered in patients with neurologic symptoms to assess respiratory function.
Therapeutic Considerations
Pit Vipers
Pre-hospital management should be focused on safe, expedient transport of the patient to an ED that can evaluate the patient.
Immediately after a bite, the patient should stay calm and find a safe area to sit or lie down.
Any items that may cause constriction as the limb swells, including rings, watches, and jewelry, should be removed.
The affected extremity should be immobilized with a loose splint and elevated at or above the heart to minimize dependent edema, which can cause localized pain during transport.
If the patient is in a remote location out of cellular phone range and alone, it may be necessary to hike to a location where contact with emergency medical services (EMS) can be made. In this case, minimizing use of the affected extremity is important.
Pressure immobilization bandages are not recommended for pit viper envenomations.
EMS should focus on maintaining the ABCs. The patient should be placed on a monitor, and IV access should be established in an unaffected extremity.
Any patient presenting with signs/symptoms of allergic reaction should be treated appropriately using local EMS protocols.
Several “treatments” prior to EMS arrival have been shown to be ineffective and may potentially be harmful to the patient. These treatments may include cutting, suction devices, electroshock/taser use, tourniquets, and ice. 
Initial evaluation in the ED should focus on the ABCs.
Envenomations to the head or neck are at high risk for swelling and airway compromise.
Patients with severe systemic toxicity causing angioedema or hypotension should receive antivenom (see below for dosing).
Allergic reactions are rare but do occur. If suspected, treat accordingly.
Elevation is recommended to minimize dependent edema. A fishnet stocking can be used on the upper or lower extremity and tied to an IV pole to maximize elevation. Photo The lower extremity can also be placed on pillows.
Although no evidence has demonstrated improved pain control, many experts anecdotally observe a marked improvement in pain control when the affected limb is elevated.
Serial measurements of the extremity should initially be performed every 15-30 min to assess for a progression of local symptoms.
There remains debate about whether the leading edge of swelling and/or pain versus constant distinct circumferential measurement points on a limb should be used. Photo Image
Once progression has stopped, the timing of measurements can be extended to every hour.
Pain should be treated with opioids. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin should be avoided due to the potential increased risk of bleeding. Increased pain or escalating doses of medications despite elevation of the extremity and antivenom administration should raise a concern for progression of the envenomation and, less likely, compartment syndrome.
Compartment syndrome is rare in pit viper envenomations.
If compartment syndrome is suspected, direct compartment pressures should be measured.
Even in the event of elevated compartment pressures, there is limited evidence to support fasciotomy as a treatment.
Animal models and case reports support the use of antivenom to treat venom-induced swelling and to reduce compartment pressures. 
In vivo models of myonecrosis with elevated compartment pressures have shown that myonecrosis, if present, is a direct venom effect and is not prevented or improved by a fasciotomy. 
If compartment syndrome is suspected or confirmed by compartment pressures and distal perfusion is intact, antivenom should be administered until compartment pressures decrease to an acceptable range.
The need for fasciotomy is very rare, and the decision for surgical intervention should be made in coordination with the local toxicologist or poison center.
Digits are a common site of envenomation. Digits have a limited space for swelling, which may result in compression of the neurovascular bundles running laterally. Compression of these structures can lead to poor perfusion and distal digit ischemia.
While most tissue loss in the digits is due to direct venom effects, a “compartment syndrome” of the finger or toe may lead to further tissue destruction.
A digital dermatomy may be beneficial in a cold, non-perfusing digit for which neurovascular compromise is suspected.
Any signs of bleeding, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, or coagulopathy should be discussed with the local toxicologist or poison control center, as these cases can be complicated and local antivenom administration practices can vary.
Blood products, including platelets or fresh frozen plasma, are not indicated as they will not reverse the venom effects.
Packed red blood cells may be considered if there are signs of severe bleeding and blood loss is a concern.
Antivenom should be administered for patients with progressive swelling, systemic toxicity, hematologic toxicity, or neurotoxicity.
Antivenoms are immunoglobulins that bind and neutralize venom activity.
The first antivenom available in the U.S., produced by Wyeth, consisted of a whole IgG product and exhibited high rates of acute allergic reactions and delayed hypersensitivity. This product is no longer available.
The antivenoms currently available in the U.S. are IgG antibodies that are cleaved to produce either Fab or F(ab’)2 fragments.
This cleaving process removes the most immunogenic portion of the IgG, the Fc portion.
Rates of acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions are much lower for Fab and F(ab’)2 antivenoms in the U.S. 
Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (CroFab™)
Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab, known as CroFab, is an ovine-derived Fab fragment.
It is FDA-approved for treatment against North American crotaline species, including rattlesnakes, water moccasins, and copperheads.
It is made by immunizing sheep with the venom of Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake), Crotalus adamanteus (eastern diamondback rattlesnake), Crotalus scutulatus (Mojave rattlesnake), and Agkistrodon piscivorus (water moccasin).
The IgG antibodies are then isolated in the serum and cleaved using papain, an enzyme found in papayas.
The isolated Fab fragments are then mixed to create a polyvalent antivenom.
CroFab™ should be considered for any patient with progressive local symptoms or any signs of systemic, hematologic, or neurotoxic symptoms. 
The initial dosing is 4-6 vials reconstituted and placed in a 250 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride and infused over 1 h.
The infusion can be started at an initial rate of 10-20 mL per hour for the first 5-10 min to assess for a potential allergic reaction to the antivenom.
If no reaction occurs, the infusion can be up-titrated to infuse the entire 250-mL bag over 1 h.
More severe systemic envenomations causing hypotension, angioedema, or other life-threatening systemic symptoms should receive 10-12 vials in a 1000 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride infused over 10-15 min.
The rate of allergic reaction to CroFab™ is 0.6%-6%. In life-threatening envenomations, the risk of death outweighs the risk of potential anaphylaxis.
Once the infusion is completed, the patient must be reassessed every 15-30 min for the first 2 h.
If there are no signs of systemic toxicity and local symptoms do not progress, the interval of reassessment can be extended to every hour for 12 h, followed by intervals of 2-4 h.
If local symptoms continue to worsen or systemic and/or hematologic signs are present, an additional 4-6 vials of CroFab™ should be administered.
This cycle is repeated until “control” is gained, in which local symptom progression stops and/or systemic symptoms have abated.
Once control is achieved, maintenance dosing of 2 vials of CroFab™ every 6 h for a total of 3 doses should be given, unless otherwise directed by the local toxicologist or poison center.
If the patient has progressive local symptoms or recurrent signs of systemic and/or hematologic toxicity at any time, a 4-6 vial dose of CroFab should be given, and the patient should be reassessed as if they were initially envenomated.
Refractory delayed hemotoxicity despite CroFab™ administration is common depending on the local rattlesnake species.
Crotalidae Equine Immune F(ab’)2 (Anavip™)
Crotalidae equine immune F(ab’)2, known as Anavip, is equine-derived. It was FDA-approved in 2015 for rattlesnake envenomations.
Anavip™ became available to the U.S. market in October 2018 and was first used in the U.S. in March 2019.
Using Bothrops asper (Fer-de-lance) and Crotalus durissus (Neotropical rattlesnake), the IgG antibody is cleaved using pepsin to create a F(ab’)2 fragment.
As a larger molecule, this fragment has a longer half-life than Fab-only antivenoms.
The initial dose is 10 vials reconstituted and placed in a 250 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride. Start infusion at 25-50 mL for 10 min and if tolerated infuse at 250 mL/h.
Signs of progressive local symptoms or any systemic symptoms should prompt administration of another 10 vials.
This should be repeated until the patient’s symptoms are “controlled.”
There is no maintenance dosing regimen for Anavip.
Coral Snakes
The vast majority of neurotoxicity from coral snakes is due to Micrurus fulvius (eastern coral snake).
Rarely is antivenom necessary for Micrurus tener (Texas coral snake). 
Other than when specifically stated, the following treatments are directed towards the eastern coral snake.
The ABCs should be assessed adequately. A NIF measurement may be used to assess or trend respiratory muscle strength.
Asymptomatic patients with a confirmed or highly suspected coral snake envenomation should be treated with antivenom before the onset of symptoms.
Due to the antivenom shortages discussed below, some have taken a “watch and see” approach for asymptomatic patients.
This approach has not been validated, and due to the potential serious sequelae, antivenom use is recommended.
For the Texas coral snake, fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone is usually adequate for pain control. 
North American coral snake antivenom (NACSA) is an equine IgG antibody derived by inoculating horses with Micrurus fulvius venom.
The IgG is isolated from the serum and then lyophilized to create a protein powder.
It is effective against Micrurus fulvius (eastern coral snake) and Micrurus tener (Texas coral snake).
NACSA has not been shown to be effective in inhibiting venom from Micruroides.
Production of NACSA was stopped in 2003. Since then, the FDA has periodically extended the expiration date. Currently, lot L67530 has an expiration date of January 31, 2020 (FDA).
Patients with symptoms of coral snake envenomation or asymptomatic patients who have likely been envenomated should receive 3-5 vials of NASCA.
Reconstitute the vials using 0.9% sodium chloride.
Once reconstituted, add the NASCA to a 250-mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride and infuse over 1 h.
Initially perform the infusion at 5-10 mL/h to assess for a potential allergy to the antivenom.
Note: skin testing with antivenom recommended by manufacturer before administering.
The infusion can be increased every few minutes until a rate of 250 mL/h is achieved.
The patient should be closely monitored for the presence or progression of symptoms.
The package insert recommends administering another 3-5 vials after the initial dose has been infused.
The risk of a clinically significant envenomation occurring must be weighed against the potential shortage of antivenom.
To date, there have been no reports of an asymptomatic patient developing symptoms after receiving 5 vials of NASCA.
Initial and repeat dosing of antivenom should be discussed with your local poison center or local toxicologist, who can help with dosing regimens and in locating vials of antivenom in your area.
Disposition
Admission
All patients who receive antivenom or exhibit progressive local symptoms or systemic toxicity, including hemotoxicity, should be admitted to a medical ICU.
Crotaline Envenomation
Patients can be discharged 18-24 h after the last dose bolus (4-6 vials) of antivenom has been given if there are no signs of progression or systemic toxicity.
Those with envenomations to the hand or foot should be referred to occupational or physical therapy upon discharge.
Thrombocytopenia and/or delayed coagulopathy is common after rattlesnake envenomations despite initial treatment with CroFab. Systemic bleeding is rare, but fatal events have occurred.
Patients should have follow-up appointments for repeat platelet, fibrinogen, and PT tests after 2-3 d and again at 5-7 d after discharge. 
Delayed thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy have been reported to occur less frequently in small studies with Anavip versus CroFab.
More robust studies are needed to determine the efficacy of Anavip in different geographic regions, as previous studies are limited to an isolated region in the southwest U.S. 
At the time of discharge, patients should be educated on the signs of low platelets, including bleeding gums, bloody stools, and bruising. All surgeries and contact sports should be avoided for at least 2 wk.
Coral Snake Envenomation
Admission
Patients with suspected envenomation who have received antivenom, require respiratory support, or have had an allergic reaction to antivenom should be monitored in the ICU for at least 24 h.
Patients can be discharged from the ICU if they have not developed symptoms within 24 h, have not had a progression of symptoms requiring airway support over 24 h, and can maintain their airway.",Snakebites
"Rapid Access
Approach to the Critical Patient
In any acute poisoning, a thorough assessment is essential, with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care.
All agitated delirious patients require continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring.
While obtaining vitals, blood glucose and ECG should also be ascertained.
Aggressive external cooling is needed if core temperature is >39.0°C.
If severe agitated delirium precludes an assessment (eg, monitoring, vitals, exam), chemical sedation (ie, benzodiazepines and/or antipsychotics) may be required:
Midazolam 5 mg IV/IM
Lorazepam 2-4 mg IV/M
Haloperidol 5-10 mg IV/IM
Olanzapine 10 mg IM
Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV or 4-5 mg/kg IM
Autonomic excitation (hypertension/tachycardia) can be treated with sedative medications; benzodiazepines are the preferred agent.
Seizures should be treated with a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant such as a benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or propofol, rather than anticonvulsants.
Refractory agitation despite sedatives may require rapid sequence intubation; etomidate or midazolam and rocuronium are recommended agents for induction and paralysis, respectively.

Key Concepts
Sympathomimetics are drugs that activate the sympathetic nervous system through any combination of catecholamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) release, reuptake inhibition, and breakdown prevention through monoamine oxidase (MOA) inhibition.

Synthetic cannabinoids
Phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine
Key clinical features of toxicity include hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, delirium, and seizures; can progress to ventricular dysrhythmias, stroke, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), coma, and death.
The most common causes of sympathomimetic-related deaths are lethal cardiac dysrhythmias, intracerebral hemorrhage, status epilepticus, and complications of hyperthermia.
A febrile agitated patient is a true toxicologic emergency. The key to management is rapid determination of core body temperature and reduction of temperature to <39°C within 30 min.
Agitated delirium must be controlled as quickly as possible to aid in temperature reduction efforts, prevent rhabdomyolysis, and complete the ED assessment.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: A hyperthermic, diaphoretic, agitated, and delirious patient presents with mydriasis, tachycardia, and hypertension.
History can be difficult to obtain because patients often have an altered mental status, in which case collateral information from prehospital personnel, law enforcement, friends, and family is crucial.
Assess for history of illicit or prescription drugs or any of the following symptoms: Fever, anxiety, paranoia, confusion, hallucinations, chest pain, headache, or seizures.
Constellation of findings indicative of diagnosis
Neurological: Altered mental status, confusion, restlessness, agitation, delirium, seizures, coma, bruxism (common with MDMA).
Psychological: Hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis, delusions, repetitive stereotypic movements.
Cardiac: Tachycardia, hypertension, ventricular dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia/infarction.
Other: Diaphoresis, hyperthermia, mydriasis with reactive pupils.
No specific test will diagnose acute sympathomimetic toxicity; history and physical exam are crucial.
Laboratory abnormalities may include metabolic acidosis, elevated CK, elevated liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and elevated creatinine.
Treatment
Cooling the patient takes precedence over all other abnormalities; the core temperature should be decreased to <39.0°C within 30 min.
Intubation and paralysis may be required to facilitate active cooling.
Conduction
Ice water bath/submersion is the fastest method but often leads to shivering and heat production; use of a long-acting neuromuscular blocking agent such as cisatracurium should be considered.
Evaporation
Lukewarm water mist and fan for evaporative cooling on top of patient with simultaneous cooling blanket below the patient.
Ice packs to the neck, axilla, and groin.

Patients with normal vital signs, a normal mental status, and a safe discharge plan can be discharged home.
Admission
Patients who continue to have abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, rhabdomyolysis, and acidosis require hospital retention.
Any patient with shock, status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, or the need for aggressive sedation/endotracheal intubation requires ICU care.
Chronic methamphetamine use leads to irreversible psychosis. These patients may require psychiatric hospitalization once their vital signs return to normal.",Sympathomimetics
"Deep Dive
Background
Sympathomimetic drugs activate the sympathetic nervous system through 3 primary mechanisms:
Catecholamine reuptake inhibition
Peripheral release of catecholamines
MAO inhibition
Each drug has varying effects on the above pathways and therefore a variable release of dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and/or serotonin.
Epidemiology
Stimulant drugs were the fourth leading cause of poisoning-related deaths in 2015, most often due to lethal cardiac arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation), intracerebral hemorrhage, status epilepticus, or complications of hyperthermia. 
Cocaine is the most popularly abused stimulant drug in the U.S. and is used via insufflation, smoking (crack or freebase), and IV routes. Cocaine use led to about 488,000 ED visits in 2010. 
Methamphetamine is the second most popular stimulant, with about 95,000 ED visits in 2010.  Mental illness and trauma lead to a significant number of methamphetamine-related ED visits. 
There is a geographic predilection to sympathomimetic drug abuse: Cocaine is more popular in urban areas and east of the Mississippi River. Methamphetamine is most abused in rural and suburban areas of the western half of the U.S., including Hawaii.  The popularity of PCP waned in the 1970s due to the rise of methamphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulant drugs, but PCP-related ED visits increased in the 2000s. 
Amphetamine-like prescription drugs have had variable popularity over time. Fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1997 because of an increased risk for pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease when used in combination with phentermine.  Methylphenidate, atomoxetine, dextroamphetamine, modafinil, and phentermine are currently available medications.
In 2009, the first synthetic cannabinoid intoxication cases were reported in the U.S., followed by synthetic cathinones such as methcathinone, mephedrone, and MDPV. 
In Europe, cathinones have been present as MDMA substitutes since the late 1990s but popular since 2009; synthetic cannabinoids have been present since 2006.
Slang terms for synthetic cannabinoids include “K2” and “spice.” Synthetic cathinones are commonly termed “bath salts.”
Pathophysiology
Cocaine is an ester anesthetic that acts via sodium channel blockade, leading to QRS widening and slowed conduction on ECG.
It can cause dysrhythmias, coronary artery vasoconstriction/vasospasm, and a prothrombotic state (stimulating platelet activation and altering coagulation factor balance), and it accelerates atherosclerosis. 
Psychedelic amphetamines such as MDMA, methyldiethanolamine, and 2C-B have potent serotonergic effects (stimulating release and blocking reuptake), leading to hallucinations and delusions.  Their potent serotonergic effects can cause serotonin syndrome either in the overdose setting or when used in conjunction with an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prescription medication.
Methamphetamine has a longer duration of effect than cocaine, which may lead to more cardiac remodeling and a higher incidence of cardiomyopathy compared with cocaine. 
The MDMA-induced temperature rise is significantly increased with elevated ambient temperature, leading to life-threatening hyperpyrexia. 
MDMA-induced hyponatremia is primarily due to antidiuretic hormone release in combination with excess water intake and fluid losses through sweating. Hyponatremia can be severe enough to cause cerebral edema. 
PMA and para-methoxymethamphetamine are potent serotonin reuptake and MAOIs with a high mortality rate, often due to repeated dosing. 
Synthetic cannabinoids are full agonists at the CB-1 and CB-2 cannabinoid receptors, leading to stimulant-like symptoms of tachycardia, seizures, hallucinations, and anxiety without direct catecholamine effects. 
PCP and ketamine are dissociative anesthetics with psychotropic effects mediated through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism. 
These drugs have additional stimulant effects through dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin reuptake inhibition along with MAO inhibition.
At high doses, sigma opioid receptor stimulation causes lethargy and coma.
PCP causes more immediate psychosis and sympathomimetic symptoms than ketamine.
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinical Presentation
The classic sympathomimetic toxidrome includes anxiety, agitation, delirium, hallucinations, seizures, mydriasis, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension in the setting of exposure to an illicit or prescription drug that stimulates the CNS. 
Acute sympathomimetic and anticholinergic toxidromes have similar features of febrile agitated delirium with tachycardia and hypertension. One major difference is diaphoresis in sympathomimetic and dry skin with anticholinergic poisoning. Minor differences are reactive pupils with sympathomimetic and minimally reactive pupils with anticholinergic poisoning. Urinary retention is specific to anticholinergic poisoning.
Often there is no clear history because the patient has an altered mental status, in which case information from prehospital personnel, law enforcement, friends, and family is needed. Prior hospital charts may reveal a pattern of drug use, although this is not diagnostic nor should it cause anchoring bias (ie, relying too heavily on one piece of information).
In severe cases, the patient may develop shock and become hypotensive. Shock is most frequently associated with hyperthermia or ventricular dysrhythmias.
Other cardiac manifestations include chest pain, coronary artery vasospasm, acute myocardial infarction, and aortic dissection in the setting of severely elevated blood pressure.
If the patient has an altered mental status or focal neurologic deficits, hemorrhagic, embolic, or ischemic stroke may have occurred, often due to transient elevated blood pressure.
A core temperature should be obtained rapidly as these patients are often hyperpyrexic (temperature >40.0°C). Skeletal muscle contraction will lead to continued elevated temperatures and rhabdomyolysis. Elevated temperature also causes DIC, elevated liver enzymes, and metabolic acidosis. 
Chronic stimulant toxicity, such as with methamphetamine, may lead to irreversible paranoid psychosis, insomnia, skin picking, dental decay, cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary hypertension. Chronic cocaine abuse can also cause paranoid psychosis, insomnia, and accelerated atherosclerosis.
A “washout” syndrome has been observed with methamphetamine and cocaine users, characterized by depression, fatigue, irritability, hypersomnia, and increased appetite.
“Body packers” and “body stuffers,” reported with both cocaine and methamphetamine, may present as completely asymptomatic.
Packers have ingested well-wrapped drug packages with the intent to transport them across borders.
Stuffers have ingested a wrapped or unwrapped drug as a means to hide it from law enforcement.
Rupture and rapid absorption of large quantities of drugs make both entities potentially lethal. 
Drug-specific findings
MDMA: Bruxism (grinding teeth is common).
Levamisole (a veterinary anthelmintic agent and prevalent cocaine contaminant): Necrotic skin lesions due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis; levamisole has also been shown to cause leukopenia and agranulocytosis. 
PCP and ketamine: Vertical nystagmus.
Radiographic Evaluation
Head CT without contrast is indicated to rule out intracranial bleed or other cerebrovascular events in the patient with altered mental status and hypertension.
Chest radiograph may be needed for the patient with chest pain or respiratory distress.
Abdominal radiograph (47%-95% sensitive) or CT may show drug packets in the case of body packers, but packet counts may not be reliable. In body stuffers, radiographic imaging routinely does not detect drugs. Although oral-contrast-enhanced CT may be superior, its sensitivity in body stuffers is unknown. Imaging is therefore not routinely indicated for body stuffers, and negative imaging does not rule out significant drug ingestion. 
Laboratory Evaluation
All altered or agitated patients should have a blood glucose obtained with vital signs.
Common laboratory abnormalities secondary to agitation and hyperthermia include hyperglycemia, elevated CK, abnormal renal function, elevated liver enzymes, and leukocytosis. Hyperkalemia may occur due to renal failure or rhabdomyolysis.  Testing should therefore include CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, CK, and UA.
Hyponatremia may be present in the setting of MDMA intoxication.
Leukopenia and agranulocytosis may be present in the setting of chronic cocaine use (from contaminant levamisole). 
UA may show elevated myoglobin in the setting of rhabdomyolysis.
If a patient has chest pain, tachycardia, hyper/hypotension, or dysrhythmias, a 12-lead ECG and troponin should be obtained.
Urine drug testing
A positive urine drug test does not indicate active intoxication. Standard hospital urine drug of abuse screens (UDOA) are qualitative immunoassays, which have false positives and false negatives, and may stay positive for days after exposure; thus, they should not be used to guide clinical management. UDOA tests cannot be used for medicolegal purposes.
Cocaine is eliminated hours after use; thus, UDOA testing targets the cocaine-specific metabolite benzoylecgonine. The test may remain positive for up to 3 d, and there are no false positives. False-negative testing may occur because of urinary dilution.
Amphetamines
Methamphetamine and amphetamines are detected on a standard UDOA as well as all drugs that are metabolized to amphetamine. Methamphetamine may stay positive for up to 6 d and amphetamine up to 9 d after use. 
Amphetamine-like prescription drugs (ie, ephedrine, fenfluramine, phentermine) may be detected on some UDOA tests.
Psychedelic amphetamines (PMA, MDMA, and MDA) may be detected on a UDOA in very high concentrations but are not routinely detected. Other psychedelic amphetamines such as the 2C or NBOMe series are not detected on a UDOA.
Cathinones: Some may be detected on a UDOA, but not reliably, most often resulting in a false negative.
False positives are frequently detected and vary depending on the assay used by the hospital clinical laboratory. Notable examples of drugs resulting in false positives are amantadine, aripiprazole, bupropion, chlorpromazine, labetalol, pseudoephedrine, ranitidine, selegiline, and trazodone.
Synthetic cannabinoids do not cross-react with UDOA cannabis testing, resulting in false-negative tests.
PCP and ketamine: Many hospital clinical laboratories no longer include PCP in their UDOA because of the many false positives reported. In high concentrations, ketamine may lead to a false-positive PCP UDOA. Other notable false positives include chlorpromazine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, ibuprofen, imipramine, lamotrigine, meperidine, methadone, thioridazine, tramadol, and venlafaxine.
Confirmatory drug testing with serum or urine
Confirmatory testing is needed for medicolegal purposes, especially in cases of child abuse or neglect. Serum or urine drug levels may not necessarily correlate with the clinical severity. The turnaround time on these tests is often days, making them unhelpful in routine emergency care.
Targeted testing is performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, depending on the hospital or reference lab used. These tests are the current gold standard and have high sensitivity and specificity.
Non-targeted testing is performed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, which has the capability to presumptively detect novel drugs of abuse such as synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, and drug analogs. This type of testing is performed in clinical laboratories working in conjunction with medical toxicologists to diagnose unusual cases. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment is directed at symptom control rather than antidotal therapy for specific drugs. The overall goals of treatment are to calm the patient sufficiently to avoid complications, such as rhabdomyolysis and metabolic acidosis, while normalizing vital signs. As with all altered patients, immediately check for hypoglycemia and treat with dextrose as needed. The altered trauma patient must have a thorough assessment for injuries.
Hyperthermia: Cooling the patient to <39.0°C within 30 min is the most important task; it supersedes all other tasks and will lead to decreased morbidity and mortality.  Check the rectal temperature quickly as other modes of temperature may be inaccurate (temporal, axillary) or slow to equilibrate (bladder Foley catheter probe). Rapid cooling can be performed most efficiently through a combination of decreasing skeletal muscle contraction and applying external cooling techniques.
May need to intubate and paralyze the patient with a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker to facilitate cooling. Succinylcholine is not recommended as it can significantly exacerbate hyperkalemia.
The authors recommend the following external cooling techniques:
Evaporative cooling with lukewarm water mist and fan. If a mister is not available, undress the patient and cover with a flat bed sheet moistened with lukewarm water and a fan directed at the patient. In addition, a cooling blanket can be placed under the patient to make a “cooling sandwich,” but a cooling blanket alone is often not sufficient (expert opinion).
Ice bath is also an adequate cooling technique but often difficult to execute.
Ice packs in the groin and axillae, cold fluids, and other cooling techniques may be used in conjunction with the above-listed techniques but alone will not cool the patient fast enough.
Pharmaceutical adjuncts
Antipyretics such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen will not work in this setting and are not indicated.
Shivering as a result of rapid external cooling may be improved with benzodiazepine administration.
Antidotes: No specific antidotal therapy is considered first-line treatment for sympathomimetic-induced hyperthermia. Any antidote, if used, must be administered in conjunction with neuromuscular blockade and external cooling techniques.
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, cyproheptadine may be considered as an adjunct (12 mg PO followed by 4 mg q1h for 4 doses or until symptom control is achieved).
Dantrolene is a specific antidote for malignant hyperthermia and may be considered an adjunct for sympathomimetic-induced hyperthermia.
If muscle rigidity persists despite neuromuscular blocking medications, then aggressive doses of benzodiazepines (1-2.5 mg/kg IV every 5-15 min up to a total of 10 mg/kg IV to achieve symptom control) are recommended. This approach is not a substitute for aggressive external cooling nor is it considered the standard of care.
Agitation and delirium: Treating agitated delirium quickly is imperative to manage hyperthermia, prevent rhabdomyolysis, and assess the patient for other injuries/illnesses that require attention. A quiet, dark room with verbal reassurance may help, but medications are often needed for rapid symptom improvement.
Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment. The authors recommend midazolam 5 mg IV or lorazepam 2-4 mg IV over 30 s. Both can be given IM. Redose every 10 min until agitation is controlled, and then double with each dose, if needed, for severe agitation. Initial pediatric dose for both midazolam and lorazepam is 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV over 2-5 min, not to exceed 4 mg/dose. Diazepam may also be used (5-10 mg IV over 1-2 min), but has a longer duration of action and thus cannot be redosed as frequently.
Antipsychotics may be used alone but most often as an adjunct to benzodiazepines. The authors recommend haloperidol 5-10 mg IM or olanzapine 10 mg IM. Haloperidol 5 mg IV may be given to monitored patients who do not have evidence of QT prolongation on ECG. In one study, olanzapine was a more effective sedative agent than haloperidol in treating acute agitation. 
Ketamine is an effective agent to sedate the agitated patient, with intubation rates similar to those of other sedative agents in the ED setting.  It has the potential to increase heart rate and blood pressure due to its sympathomimetic effects; however, it can also be used to sedate the severely agitated patient with minimal vital sign increases noted.  Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV over 1 min or 4-5 mg/kg IM is recommended.
Decontamination
Gastric lavage is not indicated.
Activated charcoal may be given within 1-2 h of drug ingestion in the alert, cooperative patient. It is ineffective for other routes of exposure and should not be given in the altered, agitated, combative, or seizing patient unless the airway is secured. It can be used in conjunction with whole bowel irrigation for body packers or stuffers.
Whole bowel irrigation is recommended for body packers and stuffers. Administer 1 L/h polyethylene glycol (GoLytely) PO or via nasogastric or orogastric routes until a clear rectal effluent is observed. The authors recommend checking bowel sounds every hour during this therapy and stopping if bowel sounds decrease or become absent. A 6-h observation period may replace whole bowel irrigation in completely asymptomatic cocaine body stuffers with normal vital signs; however, this has not been rigorously studied, and others recommend a 12-h observation period. 
Hemodialysis is not effective at removing any of these drugs and thus is not indicated.
Seizures: Drug-induced seizures respond best to global CNS depressant agents, rather than specific antiepileptic agents.
Benzodiazepines such as midazolam, lorazepam, or diazepam may be used. Initial doses of midazolam 5 mg IV, lorazepam 2-4 mg IV, and diazepam 5-10 mg IV may be given. Midazolam and lorazepam may be repeated every 5 min until symptom resolution. Consider midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IV followed by 0.1-2 mg/kg/h drip for refractory status epilepticus.
Barbiturates can be added for status epilepticus or multiple seizures unresponsive to benzodiazepines. Phenobarbital 15-20 mg/kg IV over 20 min can be used as the initial loading dose.
Propofol may be used for refractory status epilepticus. Initial dose of 1-2 mg/kg IV repeated every 5 min until seizure stops, followed by continuous infusion 1-10 mg/kg/h. Note that patients should be intubated before initiating propofol drip.
Hypertension: Achieving adequate sedation should improve blood pressure in the majority of patients; benzodiazepines are the first-line agent to treat sympathomimetic-induced hypertension.
Use non-selective beta blockers with caution in acute cocaine toxicity due to the risk of paradoxical worsening of blood pressure. If completely necessary, consider a cardioselective short-acting beta blocker such as esmolol.
Amphetamine-induced hypertension may be treated with alpha-adrenergic antagonists such as phentolamine or vasodilators such as nitroprusside only if adequate sedation is obtained.
Achieving adequate sedation should control most tachycardia and tachydysrhythmias.
Cocaine is a cardiac sodium channel blocker and thus may cause a wide-complex tachycardia. This can be treated with sodium bicarbonate (50 mEq bolus in adults, 1 mEq/kg bolus in children) to narrow the QRS complex and restore hemodynamic stability. Lidocaine is an adjunct therapy for severe wide-complex dysrhythmias (100 mg bolus in adults, 1 mg/kg in children).
Rhabdomyolysis: Aggressive hydration with normal saline is the mainstay of treatment. The goal is to maintain a urine output of 1-2 mL/kg/h. Treat resulting hypokalemia and hypocalcemia as per routine care. Bicarbonate and mannitol administration are controversial.
Admission vs. discharge
Patients who present with a sympathomimetic toxidrome but have full symptom resolution and no signs of end-organ damage can safely be discharged home or to psychiatric care.
Chronic methamphetamine use leads to irreversible psychosis; patients may require psychiatric hospitalization once vitals normalize.
Patients who present with hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, ECG changes suggesting ischemia, elevated troponin, or other signs of end-organ damage require admission.
Any patient with shock, status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, or the need for endotracheal intubation requires ICU care.
Post-Treatment Care
Referral to social work, psychiatry, and/or drug rehabilitation programs may be needed on a case-by-case basis.
Consider abuse or neglect in the intoxicated child. Social work and child protective services will need to be consulted in any sympathomimetic intoxication in a child.",Sympathomimetics

Approach to the Critical Patient
In any acute poisoning, a thorough assessment is essential, with contemporaneous patient stabilization, resuscitation, and supportive care.
If mechanical ventilation is required, a higher-than-normal minute ventilation will likely be needed because toxic alcohol poisoning typically results in severe metabolic acidosis.
Fomepizole (4-MP, 4-methylpyrazole, Antizol IV) is the treatment of choice for toxic alcohol poisoning.
Fomepizole 15 mg/kg IV loading dose over 30 min followed by 10 mg/kg q12h for 4 doses, then 15 mg/kg q12h.
Fomepizole prevents the formation of toxic alcohol metabolites via inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH); it should be initiated if toxic alcohol poisoning is suspected.
If fomepizole is not readily available, ethanol therapy can be used.
Obtain early nephrology consultation for acidotic patients, even if confirmatory levels are not yet obtained; these patients may require hemodialysis.
In the severely acidotic patient, especially for methanol poisoning, consider sodium bicarbonate infusion [eg, sodium bicarbonate 8.4% 3 ampules (150 mEq) in 1 L of 5% dextrose in water (D5W)] as a continuous infusion at 2× maintenance while awaiting hemodialysis. Not a substitute for hemodialysis.

Key Concepts
Toxic alcohols are pro-toxins that are metabolized via ADH and aldehyde dehydrogenase to toxic metabolites.
PITFALLS
Toxic alcohol poisoning classically manifests with an elevated osmolal gap (OG) and wide anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis; however, presentations vary based on time since ingestion.
Early presentations following ingestion may not show evidence of AG or acidosis; likewise, delayed presentations may not show evidence of OG.
The most serious toxic alcohols include ethylene glycol (eg, radiator antifreeze), methanol (eg, windshield fluid, fuel antifreeze, food-warming fuel canister, “moonshine”), and diethylene glycol (eg, solvent for polyester resin/polyurethanes).
Both ethylene glycol and methanol may be ingested as a substitute for ethanol when ethanol is not more readily available.
Ethylene glycol poisoning can result in acute kidney injury due to deposition of calcium oxalate crystals within the renal tubules.
Diethylene glycol toxicity, similar to ethylene glycol toxicity, can result in acute kidney injury and failure; however, the mechanism remains unclear.
Methanol poisoning can result in blindness due to direct toxicity at the optic nerves.
Isopropyl alcohol and propylene glycol are less toxic.
Inhibition of ADH through either fomepizole or ethanol prevents the development of toxic acid metabolites.
Hemodialysis removes the pro-toxins and toxic metabolites.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Textbook presentation: A patient presenting with an elevated AG metabolic acidosis and elevated OG, with or without a history of intentional ingestion of toxic alcohol.
A thorough poisoning history includes toxin identification; time, route, and quantity of exposure; co-ingestants; and onset of symptoms, if any are present. This information should be obtained directly from the patient; however, collateral (eg, medication bottles, containers) and corroborating information from emergency medical services, family, friends, and the electronic medical record must also be ascertained. Equally important is identifying whether the exposure was accidental or intentional.
The patient with acute toxic alcohol ingestion may appear clinically intoxicated and, if acidotic, may be tachypneic. Conversely, patients who present late after ingestion (“delayed presentation”) may be obtunded or comatose.
Laboratory analysis: Toxic alcohol levels (this is a send-out at most hospitals), blood gas, CMP, ethanol level, lactate, and serum osmolality.
AG calculation
AG = [Na] − [Cl + HCO3]
Normal AG is 8-16 mEq/L.
An elevated AG prompts investigation for the cause of metabolic acidosis.

OG calculation
OG = [measured serum osmolality] − [calculated serum osmolality].
Serum osmolality = [Na × 2] + [Gluc ÷ 18] + [BUN ÷ 2.8] + [EtOH in mg/dL ÷ 4.6], where Gluc = glucose, BUN = blood urea nitrogen, and EtOH = ethanol.
An ethanol level, metabolic panel, and serum osmolality must all be obtained to properly calculate the OG.
Normal OG is -10 to +10.
A normal OG does not rule out toxic alcohol exposure.
OG >10-20 is suggestive of a toxic alcohol.
Serum lactate levels may be falsely elevated by ethylene glycol metabolites or truly elevated due to inadequate perfusion.
Any intentional ingestion warrants evaluation for other undisclosed toxins (acetaminophen and salicylate levels).

Background
Epidemiology
Toxic alcohol exposures are commonly encountered. In 2017, the U.S. National Poison Data System (NPDS) received over 6,000 reports of exposure to ethylene glycol, with over 600 of these reports occurring in children less than 12 y of age. Ten ethylene glycol-associated deaths were reported.  Methanol exposures included over 2,000 reports with 8 methanol-related deaths in the same period. Over 15,000 exposures to isopropanol were reported, with no associated deaths.
Among toxic alcohol exposures, 5%-15% are intentional, presumably for self-harm.  Intentional exposures may be associated with greater clinical toxicity because larger volumes of pro-toxins are consumed.
Propylene glycol is a diluent in IV medications, most notably phenytoin, diazepam, and lorazepam. 
Diethylene glycol can be found in some forms of brake fluid or radiator antifreeze and has been responsible for outbreaks of disease when inappropriately used as a medication diluent. 
Pathophysiology
Toxic alcohol poisoning classically manifests with an elevated OG and wide AG metabolic acidosis. However, presentations may vary. 
Toxic alcohols are pro-toxins that are metabolized via ADH and aldehyde dehydrogenase to toxic metabolites that subsequently exert end-organ damage. 
The pro-toxin toxic alcohols are osmotically active and can create an elevated OG. Conversion to toxic acidic metabolites then generates an AG. Table
Over 60% of toxic alcohol exposures occur via ingestion. 
Toxic alcohols are generally small aliphatic hydrocarbons that are rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Clinically significant dermal or inhalation exposure is rare but can occur. 
The metabolism of isopropanol (also known as “rubbing alcohol” or isopropyl alcohol) results in the minimally toxic metabolite acetone, which does not produce an AG.  An elevated OG with ketosis but without acidosis suggests isopropanol toxicity. Large ingestions of isopropanol can create significant clinical toxicity due to central nervous system (CNS) depression and hemodynamic instability.
Prolonged exposure to IV pharmaceuticals containing propylene glycol as a diluent can result in lactic acidosis. This typically occurs with prolonged infusions of high-dose IV benzodiazepines, particularly lorazepam or diazepam, but can also occur with IV antiepileptics such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, or esmolol. 
Poisoning by glycol ethers, such as 2-butoxyethanol (also known as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether) or 2-methoxyethanol (also known as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), may have a clinical toxicity similar to that of ethylene glycol poisoning. 
Inhibition of ADH via concomitant ethanol ingestion or use of fomepizole prevents the production of toxic metabolites from the pro-toxin toxic alcohols.  As such, patients presenting early following ingestion who have not manifested significant acidosis or end-organ damage can be managed with ADH inhibition without hemodialysis.
AG metabolic acidosis is the expected sequela of untreated toxic alcohol exposure, with the exception of isopropanol exposure, as described above. Metabolic acidosis develops as the pro-toxins are metabolized to acids, as described in: Table. 
End-organ damage from ethylene glycol or methanol exposure occurs following metabolism to toxic metabolites. Formic acid produced from the metabolism of methanol is a direct mitochondrial poison whose toxicity manifests primarily in optic nerve cells, resulting in blindness. Nephrotoxicity is the primary manifestation of untreated ethylene glycol toxicity. The toxic metabolite oxalic acid binds with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals, which then accumulate within renal tubules, resulting in acute kidney injury. 
Diagnostic Considerations
The signs and symptoms of toxic alcohol ingestion are non-specific. Patients may even be asymptomatic.
Early after exposure, patients may exhibit clinical intoxication similar to that for ethanol; as metabolism occurs, organic acid metabolites will accumulate, resulting in metabolic acidosis and tachypnea.
Extremely large ingestions and late-presenting patients can present with CNS depression (obtundation or coma). Late-presenting patients following methanol exposure may have visual symptoms ranging from blurry vision to overt blindness.
Delayed neurologic effects including facial nerve palsy and parkinsonism can occur, including lesions seen in the basal ganglia with advanced imaging. 
Radiographic Evaluation
No specific imaging studies are indicated to evaluate patients following exposure to toxic alcohols. All alcohols are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are radiolucent.
Intoxication and obtundation can easily result in vomiting and aspiration; chest radiography should be obtained if there are any respiratory concerns.
Laboratory Evaluation
Initiating an evaluation for toxic alcohols should be based on a history or clinical suspicion of toxic alcohol ingestion. Clinical suspicions may arise from identifying an unreconciled AG metabolic acidosis. Indiscriminate screening for toxic alcohols can result in false-positive OG and unnecessary utilization of resources.
Most healthcare centers will not have the diagnostic capability to run toxic alcohol concentrations; therefore, a reasonable approach is to use surrogate laboratory testing while considering proximity to a reference laboratory for confirmatory testing.
AG is a surrogate test for unreconciled acids and is calculated as follows:
AG = [Na] − [Cl + HCO3]
Measured osmolality is a laboratory test that directly measures serum osmolality and should be ordered from the same blood draw as the other laboratory tests.
Expected (calculated) osmolality is an estimate of the patient’s expected serum osmolality based on known contributors to osmolality: sodium (Na), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose (Gluc), and ethanol (EtOH). Estimated serum osmolality is calculated as follows:
[Na × 2] + [Gluc ÷ 18] + [BUN ÷ 2.8] + [EtOH in mg/dL ÷ 4.6]
OG is a surrogate test for the parent alcohol that raises the patient’s serum osmolality. The gap is calculated by subtracting the expected osmolality from the measured osmolality. There is wide human variability in the normal values of OG, with a range of -10 to +10. 
OG pitfalls
Patients presenting late may have metabolized most of the parent alcohol, resulting in a low or absent OG. However, these patients are likely the most sick, requiring resuscitative interventions and hemodialysis.
Patients who have a negative OG at baseline could have a seemingly normal OG, even after toxic alcohol ingestion. Therefore, the OG is not a definitive rule-out test in high pre-test probability patients.
Other osmotically active substances and medical conditions can result in a false-positive OG, including alcoholic ketoacidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure, or shock. Figure 
Blood gas analysis, providing either venous or arterial pH, can help determine whether significant metabolism has occurred (figure), providing useful information regarding the urgency of hemodialysis and other therapies.
Lactate levels can be modestly elevated in ethylene glycol poisoning. One ethylene glycol metabolite, glycolate, can interfere with some lactate assays, causing profoundly but falsely elevated levels. 
Urine fluorescence is not useful and is not recommended to diagnose, rule out, or otherwise risk-stratify patients with suspected toxic alcohol poisoning. 
Urine microscopy may detect calcium oxalate mono- or dihydrate crystals; however, the absence of crystals does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure.
Calcium levels in serum can theoretically be low in ethylene glycol exposures due to complexing of oxalate and calcium; however, this is not common or clinically significant. 
Therapeutic Considerations
There is no utility for gastrointestinal decontamination in toxic alcohol poisonings. Activated charcoal will not effectively bind hydrocarbons, and gastrointestinal absorption of toxic alcohols is rapid in most cases. In select cases, where patients present very early after a large-volume ingestion, placement of a nasogastric tube to aspirate gastric contents could be considered but may be of limited utility. 
Management of toxic alcohol poisoning primarily involves two components: (1) inhibition of ADH and (2) extracorporeal elimination of the pro-toxins and/or toxic metabolites. 
Metabolism of alcohols by ADH to toxic metabolites is inhibited if serum ethanol levels remain >100 mg/dL. Concomitant ethanol ingestion may delay the toxic effects of toxic alcohol exposure by competitive ADH inhibition. 
ADH inhibition is easily accomplished with fomepizole (4-MP, 4-methylpyrazole, Antizol), which should be considered the agent of choice for ADH inhibition. 
Fomepizole
Loading dose: 15 mg/kg, slow IV infusion over 30 min followed by
10 mg/kg q12h for 4 doses and
15 mg/kg q12h until ethylene glycol or methanol levels are <20 mg/dL
Fomepizole is metabolized via cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1). Fomepizole induces its own metabolism and requires a dose increase to 15 mg/kg for the sixth and all later doses. 
ADH inhibition with fomepizole or ethanol should be continued until serum ethylene glycol or methanol level is <20 mg/dL. Below this level, endogenous mechanisms will clear the metabolites sufficiently to prevent significant acidosis or end-organ damage.  This endpoint is based on historical reports and expert opinions. Formal data for this endpoint have not been established.
When toxic alcohol concentrations are not available, endpoints for fomepizole therapy are not well defined, and consultation with a toxicologist or poison control center is recommended.
Fomepizole offers several advantages over traditional, ethanol-based ADH inhibition. Compared with ethanol, fomepizole offers simpler administration and greater affinity for ADH (>1,000 times greater). Furthermore, there is no inebriation and no need for repeated laboratory monitoring, thereby eliminating the need for observation in a critical care setting for hemodynamically normal patients who are not acidotic. 
Fomepizole indications
Significant accidental ingestion of toxic alcohol
Known or suspected intentional ingestion of a toxic alcohol
High AG acidosis and/or high OG (OG >10) of unknown cause
Serum ethylene glycol or methanol concentration ≥20 mg/dL
Toxic alcohol poisoning need not be confirmed before the administration of fomepizole. A single dose of fomepizole provides 12 h of ADH inhibition, during which time additional investigations can continue. 
In Supplementary Appendix 1, Kraut et al. reported that fomepizole is readily removed by dialysis. 
Fomepizole should be dosed as follows during dialysis:
If the last dose of fomepizole was administered >6 h prior, give another dose at the start of dialysis.
During hemodialysis, administer fomepizole every 4 h.
Upon dialysis completion, if <1 h has passed since the last dose of fomepizole, do not administer another dose; if 1-3 h have passed since the last dose, administer half of the next scheduled dose; if >3 h have passed since the last dose, administer the next scheduled full dose.
Resume q12h dosing schedule when not performing dialysis.
Toxic alcohol half-lives are greatly prolonged following the administration of fomepizole. Ethylene glycol and methanol half-lives are expected to extend to 16-20 h and up to 80 h, respectively. 
Fomepizole can be used alone, without hemodialysis, provided that the patient has no metabolic acidosis and no evidence of end-organ damage.  However, given the extended elimination half-lives following ADH inhibition with fomepizole, acute hemodialysis can be used to shorten the hospital stay depending on hospital and patient preferences.
Use of ethanol for ADH inhibition should be reserved for situations in which fomepizole is not available (eg, in rural or underserved settings). The associated complications of induced ethanol intoxication require regular monitoring in a critical care setting. Use of ethanol requires frequent laboratory monitoring (approximately every 2 h) to maintain serum ethanol in the range of 100-150 mg/dL.
Ethanol solution
IV loading dose: 8-10 mL/kg of 10% in D5W IV (rarely available), infused over 60 min followed by 1.4-2 mL/kg IV per hour.
Oral: 4 mL/kg of 20% (40 proof) or 2 mL/kg of 40%-50% (80-100 proof) as a loading dose.
4 “shots” (45 mL per “shot”) of hard liquor (80-100 proof) is the estimated loading dose for an adult male (eg, 180 mL divided by 70 kg equals 2.6 mL/kg).
Titrate to maintain an ethanol level of at least 100 mg/dL (21.7 mmol/L).
Chronic users of ethanol may require higher dosages to maintain ethanol levels >100 mg/dL (21.7 mmol/L).
Acute hemodialysis indications for suspected or confirmed toxic alcohol poisoning include any of the following: 
Acidosis pH <7.3
Evidence of end-organ damage, such as acute kidney injury or visual changes
Ethylene glycol or methanol level >50 mg/dL (due to a prolonged half-life)
Acute, intermittent hemodialysis is effective at removing both pro-toxins and toxic metabolites. Hemodialysis also offers the ability to correct severe acidosis, electrolyte disturbance, and/or uremia in late presentations. 
Standard, intermittent hemodialysis should be the first-line choice for extracorporeal removal unless hemodynamic compromise precludes its use. Continuous renal replacement therapy may be attempted if hemodynamic instability is present. 
Hemodialysis should continue until the ethylene glycol or methanol level is <20 mg/dL. If readily available, toxic alcohol levels should be assessed during dialysis to determine when to cease dialysis. If toxic alcohol levels are not readily available, normalization of OG and AG can be used as a surrogate endpoint for dialysis.  If dialysis is discontinued without a formal assessment of the toxic alcohol level, then serum AG and OG should be closely monitored for at least 24 h following dialysis cessation.
Adjunctive treatment of acidosis while awaiting hemodialysis for the acidotic patient may be accomplished with sodium bicarbonate bolus or infusion:
Bolus: 1-2 mEq/kg NaHCO3 IV push.
Infusion: 3 amps of NaHCO3 8.4% (150 mEq) in 1 L of D5W, infused at 2× maintenance.
Administration of bicarbonate may have a benefit in methanol poisoning by shifting the toxic metabolite, formate, to an ionized state, resulting in a more effective urinary clearance of formate. 
Adjunctive therapies that may help hasten the conversion of toxic metabolites to non-toxic metabolites include 
For methanol poisoning: Folic acid 50 mg IV (1-2 mg/kg) q4-6h until formate and methanol are eliminated.
For ethylene glycol poisoning: Thiamine 100 mg q24h and pyridoxine 50 mg IV or IM q6h until resolution of intoxication
Isopropanol ingestion does not warrant fomepizole use. Isopropanol’s metabolite, acetone, is essentially non-toxic and does not result in acidosis.  Severely elevated isopropanol levels (>500 mg/dL) may warrant consideration for hemodialysis. ",Toxic Alcohols

Key Concepts
The key to the management of blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is the rapid detection and surgical control of any intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
The first and most critical decision point is determining whether the patient is stable or unstable.
The vital signs of hemodynamically stable patients are consistent with normal physiology based on age, comorbid illness, and mechanism of injury.
Unstable patients have persistent hypotension despite resuscitation and require rapid definitive surgical care.
The abdominal exam is a vital component of the management of BAT. Patients can be categorized as having had either reliable exams or limited exams.
The patient has a reliable exam if he/she is able to perceive pain normally.
A patient who cannot perceive pain normally has a limited exam. In these cases, the patient’s risk factors for injury (eg, age, use of protective equipment during the injury, use of blood thinners) and the mechanism of injury (high-speed/height vs. low-speed/height) must be considered to determine an appropriate work-up.
Some mechanisms or complaints may require further work-up/evaluation, such as handlebar injuries, thoracolumbar fractures, or pain that may be referred from other areas.
Hypotension is assumed to be from hemorrhage until proven otherwise.
PITFALLS
The degree of injury may be under-appreciated in patients who have a limited exam (eg, limitations may be due to intoxication, head injury, altered mental status, spinal injury).
Elderly and very young patients may have difficult exams.
CT may miss certain injuries (ie, pancreatic injury, duodenal hematoma, or small bowel perforation).
Identify whether the patient requires immediate intervention or can undergo further evaluation.
Perform a primary survey (ABCDE; airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure) on arrival as per ATLS guidelines, with an emphasis on resuscitation and serial reassessment. A secondary survey can follow once all life threats have been stabilized. 
Consider a FAST exam.
If the FAST exam is positive and the patient is unstable → OR or emergency transfer to an appropriate level of care. Do not send an unstable patient to the CT scanner.
If the FAST exam is positive and the patient is stable → Consider a dedicated CT, if available (however, the CT should not delay transfer if indicated).
If the FAST is negative and the patient is unstable → Consider an alternative source of hemorrhage (eg, hemothorax, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, pelvic fracture, or extremity hemorrhage) or an alternative etiology for the patient’s shock (eg, pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax, or spinal shock).
Spinal shock should be diagnosed only after hemorrhage has been ruled out.
If the FAST exam is negative and the patient is stable → Determine whether the patient has a reliable or limited exam (based on clinical assessment and judgment):
Reliable exam → Perform a work-up specific to the patient’s complaints (consider broadening this work-up based on clinical judgment if the patient has risk factors for a specific injury or a significant mechanism of injury).
Limited exam → Consider patient-specific risk factors for this injury, as well as the mechanism of injury, to determine an appropriate work-up.
Evaluation options include observation with serial examinations or CT.
Special considerations: DPL can be considered if FAST is unavailable and the patient is too unstable for CT (or CT is unavailable).
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation: A 24-year-old male presents with abdominal pain after being involved in a moderate-mechanism motor vehicle accident. His blood pressure is 106/77 mm Hg, his pulse is 108 bpm, and his respiratory rate is 20 breaths/min. The patient has abdominal pain that is diffuse without guarding or rebound.
The presence of abdominal, flank, or back pain after sustaining a trauma to the area of the body located between the diaphragm and pelvis raises concern for BAT.
Some patients with abdominal injuries may lack abdominal pain (likelihood ratio [LR]– 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.79). 
History
Various mechanisms can cause BAT. Some frequently noted causes of BAT include motor vehicle collisions (MVC), falls, assaults, and recreational activities.
Details surrounding the accident may give clues as to whether the injury is low, moderate, or high energy. Hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of physical trauma can have clinically significant injuries on CT scan, making the mechanism of injury an important factor in decision-making regarding an appropriate trauma evaluation.  Important details to consider regarding the mechanism of injury are listed below:
MVC – Speed at the time of collision, damage sustained to the vehicle (ie, engine or passenger compartment intrusion or a roll-over MVC), the use of restraints, whether the airbags deployed, ejection trauma, or a death in the same passenger compartment.
Fall – Height or distance, whether any protective equipment was used.
Recreational activities – Whether any protective equipment was used.
Blast injuries – Proximity to the origin of the blast.
Note that the history itself does not suggest the degree of injury. The history in addition to the patient’s clinical exam should guide management.
Physical Exam
The absence of abdominal pain does not exclude significant abdominal injury.
Physical exam findings can range from a lack of abdominal tenderness to the presence of a peritonitic abdomen with severe tenderness to palpation and associated rebound and guarding.
Other associated exam findings include tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal bruising, flank tenderness or bruising, pelvic pain or instability, scrotal bruising, blood at the urethra, blood on rectal exam, and other unique abdominal injury patterns (ie, seatbelt sign, handlebar sign, Grey Turner sign, or Cullen sign [see below]).
A systematic review found that the physical exam findings that are most strongly associated with an intra-abdominal injury are: 
The presence of a seat belt sign (LR+ 5.6-9.9)
Abdominal rebound tenderness (LR+ 6.5, 95% CI: 1.8-24)
Hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] <90 mm Hg) at the time of ED arrival (LR+ 5.2, 95% CI: 3.5-7.5)
Abdominal distension (LR+ 3.8, 95% CI: 1.9-7.6)
Abdominal guarding (LR+ 3.7, 95% CI: 2.3-5.9)
Concomitant femur fracture (LR+ 5.2, 95% CI: 2.1-4.1)
Consider unique ecchymosis patterns, mechanisms of injury, physical exam findings, and associated injury patterns.
Handlebar sign Figure – A pattern of abrasion or ecchymosis to the abdomen that occurs secondary to the body striking against the handlebar of a bicycle. The presence of a handlebar sign or a reported history of a handlebar striking the abdomen is associated with higher rates of abdominal solid organ injuries that require surgery and/or additional intervention (21.6% vs. 0% when no handlebar injury is present or reported, P = .026). 
Seatbelt sign Photo – A pattern of abrasion or ecchymosis across the chest and lower abdomen in the shape of a seat belt. Associated with intra-abdominal injury in 30% of patients. 
Grey Turner sign Photo– Flank ecchymosis indicating retroperitoneal bleeding.
Cullen sign Photo – Periumbilical ecchymosis that indicates retroperitoneal bleeding.
Scrotal swelling or ecchymosis Photo – May indicate retroperitoneal bleeding or an associated direct genitourinary trauma.
Blood at the meatus Photo – Suggestive of a urethral injury (if blood at the urethra is present, Foley catheter insertion is contraindicated until further work-up is completed).
Blood on the rectal exam – Suggestive of a rectal laceration, which can occur with a concomitant pelvic fracture.
Routinely performing a rectal exam during a trauma work-up is not recommended. However, in the setting of a suspected cauda equina syndrome, urethral injury, or pelvic fracture, a rectal exam should be performed.
Suspected lumbar fractures (specifically a chance fracture) – A concomitant intra-abdominal injury can be found in 40% of patients. 
Referred pain:
Left shoulder – Consider a splenic injury that is irritating the diaphragm.
Right shoulder – Consider a hepatic injury that is irritating the diaphragm.

Abdominal X-ray – May be useful in the setting of penetrating trauma to locate projectiles. However, the use of X-rays in the work-up of blunt trauma is limited.
Ultrasonography – The FAST exam is useful for determining whether free fluid (presumed blood) is present in the abdomen. Image Image
CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast – Reveals the location of an injury and the degree of bleeding, if any.
Treatment
Alert the Acute Care Surgery team prior to patient arrival, if possible, especially for critically ill patients.
Use bilateral large-bore IVs:
If IV cannot be established, consider vascular access via the intraosseous route.
If a central line is necessary for ongoing resuscitation, then the optimal placement is within a vessel above the diaphragm (internal jugular vein or subclavian vein), when possible, in case of abdominal vascular injury.
Initiate cardiac monitoring.
Monitor oxygen levels.
Administer blood products +/- IV fluids:
Consider an MTP for shock.
Establish pain control:
Fentanyl 1-2 μg/kg IV q10min PRN (if SBP >90 mm Hg).
Fentanyl is a short-acting pain medication with a minimal impact on blood pressure.
Ketamine 0.1-0.3 mg/kg IV as a subdissociative dose for analgesia.
Perform an extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST), if available at your institution.
Adjunctive lab tests:
CBC, BMP, venous blood gas (with base deficit), UA, pregnancy test, TEG (if critically ill) Figure
CT the patient’s abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast (if hemodynamically stable).
Pursue immediate surgical consultation with the Trauma Surgery service (prehospital if possible) +/- transfer to a higher level of care facility for critically ill patients.
+/- angiography for suspected pelvic hemorrhage, based on your institution’s guidelines.
Disposition
OR/Surgery
The following injuries require operative management: 
BAT with hypotension and a positive FAST (or DPL).
Evisceration.
Peritonitis.
Intra-abdominal free air, retroperitoneal air, or hemidiaphragm rupture.
Contrast-enhanced CT that reveals a ruptured gastrointestinal (GI) tract, intraperitoneal bladder rupture, or a severe visceral parenchymal injury.
Persistent GI bleed noted via nasogastric tube/emesis or rectal bleeding.
The opinion of the surgical consultant.
Admission
Trauma/Acute Care Surgery should be consulted for seriously injured patients (institutional guidelines should be followed).
Patients with limited abdominal exams, concerning abdominal exams, and/or high suspicion for intra-abdominal injury/retroperitoneal injury may warrant 6-12 h of observation or longer, depending on the situation.
Patients may be observed in the ED or admitted to an inpatient unit if a longer observation is warranted.
Some CT findings that may benefit from additional observation include free abdomino-pelvic fluid without associated intra-abdominal injury, duodenal hematoma, pancreatic injury, and lower-grade splenic or lower-grade liver lacerations.
The decision for addition observation should be made in conjunction with trauma surgery consultant.

Background
Epidemiology
The primary cause of hemorrhagic shock in a patient with blunt trauma is abdominal injury.
Many patients have polysystem trauma, which may complicate their work-up.
70% of injuries from BAT result from MVC or pedestrian versus automobile collisions.
The prevalence of intra-abdominal injury in adult ED patients presenting with complaints of BAT is 13% (95% CI: 10-17%) with 4.7% (95% CI: 2.5-8.6%) of patients requiring surgery or angiographic embolization. 
The most commonly injured organs are spleen (40%-55%), liver (35%-45%), and small bowel (5%-10%). 
Hollow viscus injuries typically present with wall hematomas, perforations, or lacerations at their points of fixation.
Other injuries include trauma to the skin/musculature, diaphragm, mesenteric vessels, and retroperitoneal organs/vasculature.
Organ injuries that may be missed on CT scan include pancreatic injury, bowel/mesentery injury, bladder rupture, and diaphragm rupture.
Pathophysiology
BAT is typically due to a compressive force to the abdomen:
Direct blow - Causes compression and crush injuries to abdominal viscera and the pelvis, leading to solid and hollow organ rupture.
Shearing injury - Due to sudden deceleration. Leads to lacerations of organs and vasculature that have fixed supporting ligaments.
Laceration injury - Due to broken ribs or pelvic bones, which then puncture intra-abdominal organs.
Blast injury - Occurs secondary to a high-energy explosion. There are four types of blast injury, ranging from primary to quaternary:
Primary - Injury due to blast pressure on gas-containing structures.
Secondary - Penetrating or blunt injury due to strike by projectiles.
Tertiary - Blunt injury due to being thrown into another object from blast wind.
Quaternary - All other injuries secondary to blast.
The peritoneum is not compressible and can accommodate a patient’s entire blood volume, making intra-abdominal hemorrhage control a priority during resuscitation.
Diagnostic Considerations
History
Historical data regarding the method of injury is important. However, the mechanism alone (in the absence of vital signs and clinical exam) does not directly predict injury.
Physical Exam
The clinical presentation of patients with BAT may vary from stable with minimal (or no) abdominal tenderness to critically ill with evidence of peritonitis and requiring immediate operative intervention.
Remember that the lack of abdominal tenderness does not exclude injury.
A lack of degree of suspicion in this patient population may lead to a delay in the diagnosis of a clinically significant injury.
Hypotension is presumed to be due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise.
Intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal injury should be of high consideration. However, the clinician must remember that the evaluation of other body systems (scalp, thorax, pelvis, extremities) is critical to rule out other sources of shock.
The development of hypotension, even if transient, is clinically significant.
A single decrease in SBP <105 mm Hg during resuscitation is associated with the patient being 12 times more likely to undergo therapeutic surgical or endovascular intervention (OR 12.4, 95% CI: 2.6-59.2, P = .002) than patients who maintained SBP >105 mm Hg. 
Physical exam findings can range from the lack of abdominal tenderness to the presence of a peritonitic abdomen with severe tenderness to palpation and associated rebound and guarding.
A systematic review found that the physical exam findings most strongly associated with intra-abdominal injury are: 
The presence of a seat belt sign (LR+ 5.6-9.9).
Abdominal rebound tenderness (LR+ 6.5, 95% CI: 1.8-24).
Hypotension on ED arrival with SBP <90 mm Hg (LR+ 5.2, 95% CI: 3.5-7.5).
Abdominal distension (LR+ 3.8, 95% CI: 1.9-7.6).
Abdominal guarding (LR+ 3.7, 95% CI: 2.3-5.9).
Concomitant femur fracture (LR+ 5.2, 95% CI: 2.1-4.1).
Other associated exam findings such as:
Tachycardia
Hypotension
Abdominal bruising
Flank tenderness or bruising
Pelvic pain or instability
Scrotal bruising
Blood at the urethra Photo
Blood on rectal exam
Other unique abdominal injury patterns, including seatbelt sign, handlebar sign, Grey Turner sign, and Cullen sign
One study presents a clinical prediction rule that aims to describe patients with a low probability of intra-abdominal injury:
Patients presenting without any of the following will have a low probability of intra-abdominal injury.
Hypotension (initial SBP <90 mm Hg)
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <14,
Abdominal tenderness to palpation
Costal margin tenderness to palpation
Hematocrit <30%
Hematuria >25 red blood cells (RBCs)/high-powered field (hpf)
The sensitivity (95.8%; 95% CI: 91.1%-98.4%) and negative predictive values (98.6%; 95% CI: 97.1%-99.5%) were found to be high during the validation of this study and can be used to assist providers in determining whether a low-risk patient can forego a CT scan. 
Care should be taken to note other important exam findings that may prompt further work-up:
Seatbelt sign (discussed below) Photo
Handlebar sign (discussed below)
Grey Turner sign and Cullen sign (discussed below)
Scrotal swelling or ecchymosis:
May signify direct genitourinary trauma or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Blood at the urethra:
This is suggestive of a urethral injury, and Foley catheter insertion is contraindicated. A retrograde urethrogram must be performed to ensure that no urethral injury is present. (See Chapter: Urological Trauma)
Blood on digital rectal exam:
This is suggestive of a rectal laceration, which is typically caused by a pelvic fracture. If blood is found, the patient should undergo CT imaging (if stable).
Referred pain:
Pain can be referred to the left or right shoulder due to diaphragmatic irritation from hemoperitoneum, splenic injury (left shoulder), or liver injury (right shoulder).
Work-up
History and clinical evaluation may be limited due to various factors, such as
Altered mental status (due to intoxication, traumatic brain injury, history of dementia)
Distracting injury
Spinal injury (leading to change in sensorium)
Extremes of age
Always weigh the probability of intra-abdominal injury (based on mechanism, available clinical findings, and prior medical history) when deciding whether to obtain CT imaging for a hemodynamically stable patient with BAT.
Elderly patients have higher complication rates and mortality rates than younger patients due to several factors, including
Pre-existing medical conditions
Decreased physiologic reserve
An inability to increase their cardiac output along with peripheral vascular resistance to compensate for hypotension 
An appropriate level of triage and early aggressive management in the elderly population is recommended.  (See Chapter: Geriatric Trauma)
Additional challenges can occur in the pediatric population. (See Chapter: Pediatric Major Trauma Assessment)
Consider additional work-up for specific exam findings, such as
Seatbelt sign:
The seatbelt sign is a pattern of linear ecchymosis or skin abrasions over the neck, chest, and abdomen that resembles the shape of a seat belt worn during an MVC.
Results secondary to force transmitted during high-energy impact MVCs.
Early lap-type seat belts led to many significant belt-related injury patterns during collisions. Seatbelts were then upgraded to a safer three-point belt system (overlying chest and lower abdomen/pelvis).
Although safer, there are still some associated intra-abdominal injury patterns.
These injuries include abdominal wall disruption, mesenteric injury, intestinal injury (bowel perforation and hematoma) as well as lumbar spine injury (chance fractures).
The seatbelt sign is associated with intra-abdominal injury in 30% of patients. 
A systematic review found that the presence of a seat belt sign has an LR ranging from 5.6 to 9.9 for intra-abdominal injury. 
Given that most vehicles are now equipped with airbags, further research has investigated the continued association of intra-abdominal injury when a seatbelt is used in combination with an airbag.
One study found that in patients presenting with a seat belt sign and reported airbag deployment, there was no statistical difference in intra-abdominal injury among those with or without a seatbelt sign. 
However, further research is needed to determine whether seatbelt-related injury is lessened for crash victims whose airbags also deployed.
Handlebar sign:
The handlebar sign consists of a circular ecchymosis or abrasion over the thoracoabdominal region that occurs after striking the torso against the edge of the handlebar.
One study at a large pediatric hospital found that the report of a handlebar injury or the presence of a handlebar sign significantly increased the rate of soft tissue injury (23.4% vs. 2.2% of non-handlebar injuries from bicycle accidents, P < .001), abdominal solid organ injury (34.6% vs. 4.3%, P < .001), and abdominal hollow viscus injury (9.3% vs. 0.7%) compared with those who have bicycle accidents without a handlebar injury. 
Grey Turner and Cullen signs:
These signs consist of ecchymosis over the flank (Grey Turner sign) or periumbilical region (Cullen sign).
These signs are suggestive of retroperitoneal hemorrhage and should prompt the physician to obtain further imaging to investigate the retroperitoneum.
Blood at the urethra:
A further work-up with a retrograde urethrogram (filling the urethra with contrast) is needed to determine if the patient has a urethral injury. If one is found, then the patient will benefit from a consultation with Urology.
Blood on the rectal exam:
Further imaging should be obtained to determine whether an associated pelvic fracture is present and to determine the location of rectal trauma and the amount of bleeding. The patient may require surgical repair.
Radiographic Evaluation
Ultrasonography:
The FAST exam is performed by evaluating dependent areas in the abdomen that may fill with intraperitoneal blood.
Fluid noted in these areas in the setting of BAT is suggestive of hemoperitoneum and warrants further work-up with a CT of the abdomen and pelvis (if stable) or a direct transport to the OR for exploratory laparotomy (if unstable). ImageImage
The areas evaluated include the right upper quadrant (hepatorenal space), left upper quadrant (splenorenal space), suprapubic region (pouch of Douglas), and subxiphoid (cardiac view to assess for pericardial effusion).
In the setting of concomitant thoracic trauma, the U/S probe may also be placed on the chest bilaterally to assess for a pneumothorax. Performing this procedure in addition to the FAST exam is referred to as an extended FAST exam (eFAST).
U/S can be performed quickly and does not emit radiation.
A meta-analysis has shown that the bedside FAST exam has a high specificity (95%) but low sensitivity (68%) in the setting of abdominal trauma, making it a useful exam in identifying intra-abdominal injury. 
The FAST exam can detect as little as 200 mL of free fluid intra-abdominally. 
One study found that a positive FAST exam has an LR+ of 30 (95% CI: 20-46) for predicting intra-abdominal injury in patients with BAT, which is greater than the LR of any exam finding or laboratory value, making a positive FAST exam the most accurate bedside test for patients with BAT.
The same study found that a negative FAST exam has an LR− of 0.26 (95% CI: 0.19-0.34), demonstrating that a negative FAST exam does not rule out a clinically significant intra-abdominal injury. 
The FAST exam does have limitations: eg, it cannot evaluate the retroperitoneum, and views may be limited due to the presence of bowel gas or provider technique. Importantly, the FAST exam cannot differentiate between hemoperitoneum, ascites, or uroperitoneum.
CT:
A CT with IV contrast is highly sensitive (97%-98%) and highly specific (97%-99%) for the detection of intra-abdominal injury. 
CT has a very low miss rate, which one study reported to be <0.06%. 
However, CT is limited in the detection of a few specific injuries. These injuries include mesenteric injury, hollow viscus/bowel injury, and pancreatic injury.
Oral contrast is not necessary to detect injury and should not be routinely used because it can cause delays.
The benefits of CT include the ability to detect, locate, and quantify bleeding. Additional benefits include the ability to evaluate the retroperitoneum and the lumbar spine.
CT has several drawbacks, which include exposure to ionizing radiation, possible nephrotoxicity from IV contrast, possible need for sedation, and movement of a potentially ill patient from the ED to the radiology suite. CT scans are also expensive.
CT scans remain a crucial tool in ruling out intra-abdominal injury.
Plain films are not routinely obtained in the setting of isolated BAT.
In the setting of concomitant blunt chest trauma, a CXR may be useful to assess for any injury that may benefit from treatment prior to the patient leaving the ED for a CT scan (ie, pneumothorax, hemothorax).
CXR findings that may indicate intra-abdominal injury include air under the diaphragm, diaphragmatic hernia, and lower rib fractures.
A radiograph of the abdomen has no utility in the setting of BAT unless there is a need to assess for the position and trajectory of projectiles in the setting of concomitant penetrating injury. Such a radiograph may reveal free air under the diaphragm. However, it is recommended that the patient be upright for at least 2 min for free air to be seen.
A pelvis X-ray may be performed. However, if the patient is stable and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis has already been ordered, then the pelvis X-ray should be deferred to save resources and limit unnecessary radiation, because fractures, if any, will be seen on the CT scan. If a CT is not anticipated and a pelvic fracture is suspected, then a pelvic X-ray may be performed.
Angiography:
The goal of angiography is the embolization of bleeding vessels or intravascular stent placement.
Angiography is typically utilized when there is a vascular injury, unstable pelvic fracture, or specific types of solid organ injury.
Angiography may not be available at all institutions.
DPL:
DPL is now significantly less common with the advancement of U/S and CT technologies, which are standard for radiographic evaluation of patients with BAT.
DPL is an invasive procedure that involves introducing a needle into the peritoneum to determine whether peritoneal blood is present.
DPL is 95% sensitive and 99% specific for intra-abdominal blood. 
A positive result consists of the aspiration of 10 mL of gross blood or the presence of GI contents. If neither is found, then 1 L of warmed normal saline is infused into the abdomen and allowed to drain back out. The lavage is sent to laboratory for analysis. A positive result in patients with blunt trauma is >100,000/mm3 RBC count, >500 WBC/mm3, or food/bile/particulate matter.
Today, there is little utility in performing DPL, because U/S is useful in determining whether blood is present, and CT is able to locate the source and quantity of blood.
However, DPL remains more sensitive than CT or U/S for detecting hollow viscus injury. 
DPL is an invasive procedure with risks of visceral injury. DPL may be difficult to perform on patients who are obese or have had previous abdominal surgeries and difficult for clinicians with little experience with the procedure. The fluid infused may interfere with the accurate interpretation of future imaging. For these reasons, U/S and CT have replaced DPL at most institutions. However, DPL may still be considered in two clinical situations:
In the setting of a hemodynamically unstable patient with a negative or equivocal FAST exam, a DPL may be performed to determine whether the instability is secondary to hemoperitoneum or an alternate injury.
For example, a patient with BAT and an unstable pelvic fracture may be hemorrhaging from an intra-abdominal injury or secondary to bleeding from the pelvic plexus. DPL can help to determine which site will require emergency intervention (OR for intra-abdominal hemorrhage vs. angiography suite for hemorrhage from a pelvic fracture).
In the setting of a hemodynamically unstable patient with BAT and known ascites, DPL may be useful in determining whether shock is secondary to intraperitoneal hemorrhage or an alternate injury, because U/S cannot differentiate between hemoperitoneum, ascites, or uroperitoneum.
Laboratory Evaluation
A trauma panel often consists of a CBC, BMP, AST/ALT, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), type and screen, arterial blood gas (ABG), lactate, UA, and a urine drug screen (UDS).
Of the several laboratory tests studied, only a few strongly predict intra-abdominal injury. These include the presence of a base deficit, hematuria, and hematocrit level <30%. 
CBC:
Hemoglobin/hematocrit - Changes in a patient’s hemoglobin or hematocrit depend on several different variables and cannot be used to calculate the degree of hemorrhage in an acute trauma patient.
Immediately after injury, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels may be grossly unchanged and should not be used to exclude significant hemorrhage.
In contrast, a low hemoglobin or hematocrit should raise the clinician’s suspicion for acute hemorrhage.
One study found that a hematocrit level of <30% had an increased likelihood of predicting intra-abdominal injury (LR 3.3, 95% CI: 2.4-4.5). 
Changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit values are dependent on the extent and duration of hemorrhage, exogenous fluids given, and endogenous plasma refill (extravascular fluid moving intravascularly).
Serial levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit may be useful in determining a trend, thus a value measurement upon arrival is recommended as a means of comparison.
WBC - Leukocyte count is of limited value. Values may be normal or elevated in those with minimal or significant trauma.
Leukocyte elevation can occur through demarginalization due to stress response or visceral injury.
A retrospective study found that more severely injured patients have significantly higher WBC counts than less severely injured patients. However, the WBC was within the normal range for both groups, limiting the usefulness of this test. 
Another study reported a statistical difference in WBC counts and that an increase in the WBC count was correlated with higher Injury Severity Score (ISS). However, the correlation was noted to be weak (correlation coefficient = 0.37). 
Overall, WBC is not a useful test in isolation in the setting of acute trauma.
Platelets - A useful measurement for those with a suspected brain injury in cases of associated intracranial injury
Base deficit:
In the setting of trauma, an elevated base deficit raises significant concern for acute hemorrhage.
Studies have shown that a base deficit of >6 mEq/L is indicative of significant hemorrhage and shock, making this measurement a reliable early indicator of injury severity. The likelihood ratio of intra-abdominal injury with a base deficit of >6 mEq/L is 18 (95% CI: 11-30). 
The base deficit can be found on the venous or arterial blood gas.
Trending these values serially is helpful in determining the degree of response to ongoing resuscitation.
TEG or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) Figure:
These point-of-care devices evaluate the viscoelastic properties of whole blood.
The devices can measure the efficiency of blood clotting and allow for the visual assessment of blood coagulation.
Urine pregnancy test (for any woman of childbearing age).
UA:
Gross hematuria:
In the setting of BAT, gross hematuria is representative of a significant renal (renal contusion, laceration, or vascular injury) or bladder injury.
However, the absence of gross hematuria does not exclude significant renal injury or avulsion.
Microscopic hematuria:
The significance of microscopic hematuria in adults is more controversial, with some studies citing a strong correlation with intra-abdominal injuries.
Patients with microscopic hematuria have an increased probability of having an intra-abdominal injury, especially in the setting of hypotension.
Some recommendations note that further imaging should be obtained to evaluate for intra-abdominal injury for any patient with blunt trauma with gross hematuria and any patient with blunt trauma with microscopic hematuria with a history of shock (SBP <90 mm Hg for adults, SBP <80 mm Hg for children). 
In children with BAT, a UA with 5 RBC/hpf has an adjusted odds ratio of 4.8 (95% CI: 2.7-8.4) for predicting the presence of intra-abdominal injury. 
One study found that a UA has a high sensitivity for the detection of intra-abdominal injury and genitourinary injury.  The presence of >25-50 RBC/hpf has an LR of 3.7-4.1 for intra-abdominal injury. 
Coagulation studies:
PT and PTT studies are useful in patients with ongoing hemorrhage or for patients who are taking blood-thinning agents.
Lipase/amylase:
Lipase and amylase are of limited value. These tests are neither sensitive nor specific for pancreatic injury.
AST/ALT:
AST and ALT levels are of limited value.
Data have shown that both AST and ALT are elevated in response to hepatic injury.
However, because a number of conditions may elevate AST and ALT levels, their usefulness in the acute trauma setting is limited. Other conditions include alcohol (ethanol) use, hepatitis, or recent vomiting.
In the pediatric population, AST level >200 U/L and ALT >125 U/L have an adjusted odds ratio of 17.4 (95% CI: 9.4-13.2) for predicting intra-abdominal injury and are useful for BAT. 
UDS and ethanol level:
UDS are not associated with high ISS or the need for surgical intervention, making these screening tools less useful in the acute trauma setting. 
In the setting of altered mental status, these tools are used by some clinicians to determine whether mental status can be attributed to intoxication.
An altered patient with a negative ethanol and UDS should alert the physician to a more concerning cause of altered mental status.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment
Treatment is based on the type of injury diagnosed. Depending on the injury type, patients will either be discharged to home with return precautions, undergo a period of observation, undergo a surgical procedure, or undergo a procedure by Interventional Radiology. Treatment decisions should be made in consultation with Trauma Acute Care Surgery.
Patients who are critically ill require emergency Trauma Acute Care Surgery consultation or transfer to a facility of higher care.
All attempts should be made to stabilize the hemodynamically unstable patient through resuscitation. The goals of resuscitation include maintaining oxygen delivery to end organs through the restoration of circulatory volume and the prevention of ongoing bleeding (including the reversal of coagulopathy and surgical intervention).
Vascular resuscitation (blood +/- IV fluids):
Historically, 1-2 L of IV crystalloid has been used to resuscitate hemodynamically unstable patients in the prehospital setting and upon arrival at the ED. More recently there has been a shift away from crystalloid in the critically ill to the administration of blood earlier in the patient’s resuscitation, given that IV crystalloid has been found to lead to dilutional anemia, decreased oxygen-carrying ability, acidosis, and coagulopathy due to dilution of coagulation factors.
MTP:
MTP refers to a large-volume resuscitation with blood products at a predetermined ratio of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. It should be considered in any unstable patient with BAT. (See Chapter: Anemia and Transfusions)
Resuscitative thoracotomy (See Chapter: Thoracotomy)
If, despite vascular resuscitation, the patient is peri-arrest or in extremis (profound refractory shock), develops cardiac arrest in the ED, or arrives at the ED in cardiac arrest (within 10 min of the loss of signs of life), then an ED resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross clamp can be considered (WEST). Survival after ED thoracotomy (EDT) is higher for those with penetrating trauma (stab wounds, followed by gunshot wounds) than for those with blunt trauma.
The signs of life are defined as the presence of spontaneous breathing, presence of a pulse, presence of cardiac electrical activity, presence of a blood pressure (measurable or palpable), and spontaneous movement.
The decision to perform an EDT is based on guidelines produced by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) and Western Trauma Association (WEST). The groups differ only slightly in their recommendations.
The WEST guidelines state that if the patient has blunt trauma and has had loss of signs of life for <10 min, then an EDT is recommended. However, if the signs of life have been lost for >10 min, then survivability is negligible, and the patient may be pronounced dead. 
The EAST guidelines conditionally recommend an EDT in blunt trauma if the patient has loss of pulses with signs of life as described above [EAST]. A systematic review found that this patient population has an EDT survival of 4.6%, which is 9 times greater than without an EDT performed (0.5%). However, if a patient presents pulseless without signs of life, then an EDT is not recommended, because survival is low (0.7% with EDT vs. 0.001% without) and a neurologically intact outcome after EDT is even lower (0.1%), such that the risk to the provider is higher than the benefit to the patients. 
Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA):
REBOA is used to occlude the aorta in the distal thoracic aorta or distal abdominal aorta for hemorrhage occurring in areas underneath the diaphragm.
REBOA is typically deployed in those who are unresponsive or transiently responsive to intravascular fluid resuscitation as a temporizing measure until the patient can be transported to the operating suite.
In some institutions, REBOA has replaced EDT for the control of noncompressible abdominal hemorrhage. Institutional guidelines should be followed regarding the implementation of REBOA.
Limitations to implementation include need for focused training on use and access to the common femoral artery, which may be difficult in profound hypotension.
For patients who are observed:
The exact time of observation has not been clearly established. One study found that all patients with intra-abdominal injury that required operative (or angiographic) intervention developed signs or symptoms concerning for intra-abdominal injury (and subsequently a diagnosis of intraabdominal injury by either CT or surgery) within 8 h and 25 min of ED arrival (with a mean time of 74 min, SD of 55 min). This suggests that a period of 9 h of observation should be sufficient for most patients with intra-abdominal injury. 
A recent observational study reported an increased mortality rate with REBOA compared with patients not receiving REBOA.  More research is needed to determine whether this intervention provides a survival benefit, and if so, in which patients.

Special Diagnoses
Most injuries, if present, are diagnosed on CT A/P. Solid organ injuries are typically graded from I to V with grade I being mild and grade V being the most severe of any grade that will benefit from a consult with a trauma surgeon for recommendations.
Most low-grade injuries do not require surgical intervention but may be amenable to a period of observation based on the medical opinion of the trauma surgeon.
High-grade injuries, hollow viscus injuries, vascular pedicle injuries, pelvicalyceal injuries, and vascular injuries with active contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm typically require intervention by a surgeon or an interventional radiologist.
Specific treatments for various solid organs vary based on institutional protocols  and are beyond the scope of this chapter.
Some details regarding special diagnoses are:
Bladder injury:
Either CT cystogram or CT with delayed phase imaging, allowing contrast to enter the kidneys and bladder, is required to further characterize the injury.
Diaphragm injury:
May be noted on CXR by the presence of bowel in the chest cavity. However, this diagnosis is difficult, and a normal CXR does not exclude this type of injury.
This injury is rare in blunt trauma.
Left-sided injury is more common than right-sided because the liver is protective on the right side.
Right-sided injuries are typically managed conservatively because the liver protects intraabdominal contents from herniating through.
The left-sided diaphragm injuries typically require operative intervention to prevent the herniation of abdominal contents. The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of diaphragm injury on CT scan is 90%.
If clinical concern persists, then laparoscopy may be useful to detect injury.
Hollow viscus injury:
The most common sites are the proximal jejunum (near the ligament of Treitz) and distal ileum (near the ileocecal valve).
Hollow viscus injuries are rare but have a high morbidity and mortality rate.
One study found that of 227,000 blunt trauma admissions, only 0.3% had a small bowel injury. When controlling for the ISS among patients with BAT, the authors found that the mortality rate of patients with any form of hollow viscus injury was greater than those without hollow viscus injury (19.8 vs. 12.2; P < .001). 
Injuries that result in a wall hematoma may be amenable to observation or surgical exploration with drainage of the hematoma followed by repair.
Hollow viscus injuries that result in free air typically require surgical exploration for repair.
Pancreatic injury:
Delay in the diagnosis of a pancreatic injury with associated duct disruption has a high morbidity rate, because a delay in diagnosis may lead to the formation of abscess, fistula, sepsis, and hemorrhage.
This type of injury is commonly missed on initial CT imaging, and abdominal exam is limited, given that the organ is retroperitoneal.
Leukocytosis and elevations in amylase and lipase are not helpful in making the diagnosis.
An ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) study is diagnostic and therapeutic if clinical suspicion remains high.
An MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) can also be performed but has the disadvantage of not being therapeutic. Once diagnosed, low-grade injuries can be managed by drainage, whereas higher-grade injuries may require resection and drainage. 
Renal injury:
Typically due to a rapid deceleration injury.
Absolute indications for surgical exploration or intervention include persistent renal bleeding.
Relative indications include devitalized renal parenchyma (>25%), urinary extravasation, incomplete staging, and arterial thrombosis. 
Decisions should be made with Trauma Acute Care Surgery.
Splenic injury:
The most commonly injured organ in blunt trauma.
Lower grades are typically nonoperative and are treated with observation.
Higher grades typically require operation.",Blunt Abdominal Trauma
"Rapid Access
Approach to Critical Patient
Abide by advanced trauma life support (ATLS) guidelines when approaching the critical trauma patient. Perform critical interventions as you progress through the primary and secondary survey, starting with the ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation).
A surgical consultation should be obtained as soon as possible for collaborative evaluation, treatment, and management when significant blunt thoracic injuries are suspected or identified.
Injuries that can be immediately life threatening in the setting of thoracic trauma include:
Upper airway obstruction
Tension pneumothorax
Cardiac tamponade
Structural cardiovascular injuries such as a thoracic aortic injury.
Evaluate the patency of the airway and consider endotracheal intubation if the patient has sustained a severe trauma that is concerning for airway obstruction or is unable to protect their airway.
Recognize that certain injuries (ie, pneumothorax or bronchotracheal injury) may be worsened with positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and require prompt management.
Blunt thoracic trauma is one area where addressing the patient’s breathing may come before the airway (ie, decompressing a tension pneumothorax prior to intubation).
When evaluating the patient’s breathing, specifically assess the stability of the chest wall and the patient’s breathing mechanics, looking for paradoxical chest wall movement.
If the patient is hypotensive and in severe respiratory distress:
Consider needle decompression or tube thoracostomy to relieve a tension pneumothorax.
Assess the patient for symmetric pulses and use direct pressure or a tourniquet, if possible, to stop life-threatening bleeding.
Use a bedside U/S to evaluate for a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
Obtain IV access as quickly as possible to permit adequate resuscitation and medication administration.

Key Concepts
Blunt thoracic trauma includes a variety of injuries that can occur to structures contained in the thorax, which include the chest wall and its contained organs.
The most common cause of a blunt thoracic injury is motor vehicle collisions (MVCs).
Patients older than 60 y are at a significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
To evaluate patients for blunt thoracic trauma, mechanism of injury is an important consideration. This is particularly important following MVCs with rapid deceleration or high-energy force, which should increase the physician’s suspicion of a thoracic injury.
Similarly, abnormal vital signs are important and should increase suspicion for thoracic trauma.
Hemodynamic stability does not rule out aortic or another significant thoracic injury.
Even if there are minimal or no external signs of thoracic trauma, devastating internal thoracic injuries may exist.
Failure to consider the possibility of an esophageal perforation with pneumomediastinum in the setting of blunt thoracic trauma can result in significant morbidity and mortality.
There remains some controversy regarding the best approaches for working up and treating blunt cardiac trauma.
The majority of blunt thoracic trauma is non-operative and managed conservatively.
PPV in a patient who has sustained a blunt chest trauma, specifically a pneumothorax or tracheobronchial injury, can significantly worsen their condition by creating a tension physiology.
Overzealous fluid administration to a patient who has sustained a blunt cardiac injury or pulmonary contusions can ultimately worsen outcomes.
Providing adequate analgesia to patients who have sustained a blunt thoracic trauma is important to their pulmonary health and ultimate outcome.
Key Diagnostic Elements
Traditional textbook presentation: a middle or advanced aged, unrestrained driver is hypotensive, tachycardic, and in respiratory distress at the time of ED presentation via emergency medical services after an MVC.
After assessing the ABCs, consider the patient’s vital signs, physical exam, and mechanism of injury, and perform an extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) and portable CXR.
Use the patient’s history to help determine if he/she is at risk for blunt thoracic trauma (key historical elements include being unrestrained, a high-speed/high-energy injury, ejection from a vehicle, or an abrupt deceleration).
Physical findings that may indicate an intrathoracic injury include
Respiratory difficulty or increased work of breathing
Tenderness over the chest wall
Palpable subcutaneous air or bony abnormalities
Contusion/ecchymosis
Chest pain and tenderness are the most sensitive findings of blunt thoracic trauma.
History and physical exam alone, however, are not adequate for diagnosing all intrathoracic injuries.
The majority of patients in whom there is clinical suspicion for an intrathoracic injury should receive, at a minimum, a bedside U/S with cardiac and lung images and a CXR.
An ECG should be obtained in all patients who have sustained a blunt chest wall trauma with a significant injury mechanism and/or chest pain.
Treatment
There is a large spectrum of management options for blunt thoracic trauma with or without invasive procedures, which range from incentive spirometry to a thoracotomy, depending on the injuries that are identified.
The majority of trauma patients can be managed expectantly with volume resuscitation and a tube thoracostomy if indicated.
If the patient is in critical condition, use ATLS and trauma resuscitation guidelines and perform immediate, life-saving interventions during the primary survey:
Finger or needle thoracostomy followed by a chest tube for a tension pneumothorax or hemothorax.
Endotracheal intubation as indicated.
Pericardiocentesis if a pericardial tamponade is discovered and the patient is significantly symptomatic.
When an ED thoracotomy is indicated, it should be performed immediately if within the accepted time frame and the institution has the resources in place to manage the patient through an operative repair.
Disposition
Disposition depends on the range of injuries identified and the patient’s age and comorbidities.
Patients with simple chest wall contusions and mild musculoskeletal injuries can be discharged home with analgesia and strict return precautions.
Some patients may require immediate transfer to the OR for the management of life-threatening injuries.",Blunt Thoracic Trauma
"Deep Dive
Background
Epidemiology
Trauma epidemiology is highly skewed, given that the majority of the information from trauma data registries comes from patients who are admitted to hospitals.
Of the nearly 40,000 traumatic deaths in the U.S., 20%-25% can be attributed to thoracic trauma (National Trauma Data Bank).
Thoracic trauma accounts for half of all trauma center admissions (National Trauma Data Bank).
Traumatic thoracic injuries are rarely isolated. More than half of thoracic trauma patients also have head, abdominal, or extremity injuries.
The leading cause of thoracic trauma is MVCs. However, other etiologies include a fall from a significant height, sports injury, and assault.
As MVCs are a leading cause of thoracic trauma, it is important to note that there are elements of an MVC that increase the risk of a thoracic injury (eg, rapid deceleration).  Understanding these high-risk mechanisms is very important.
These features include, but are not limited to, high-speed trauma, unrestrained MVC, extensive vehicle damage, steering wheel deformity, ejection from the vehicle, a fatality at the scene, and prehospital hypotension. 
Trauma continues to be a disease of young people. However, the risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly with age.
There are a number of causes of morbidity and mortality following blunt thoracic trauma, as a variety of injuries can occur within the thorax that can affect patients. These will be detailed later in the chapter.
Injuries that most often cause immediate death, albeit rare in and of themselves, are myocardial wall or thoracic aortic ruptures.
The main causes of an early death or death within 30 min to 3 h after injury are tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, airway obstruction, and uncontrolled hemorrhage.
Diagnostic Considerations
As with any trauma patient, start with the ABCs. However, there are circumstances in which intervention may supersede this order.
In the case of a possible tension pneumothorax, intervention to correct a breathing disruption may need to come before managing the airway (ie, pneumothorax decompression before placing an endotracheal tube).
The primary assessment should aim to immediately identify life-threatening injuries and should include an evaluation and intervention for any critical findings or unstable vital signs (eg, hypotension or hypoxia). Some injuries that may be immediately apparent and benefit from rapid intervention include
Tension pneumothorax: tachypnea, chest pain, hypoxia, absent breath sounds, and subcutaneous air.
Cardiac tamponade: shortness of breath and “Beck’s triad” of hypotension, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds.
Aortic injury: hypotension and severe chest pain.
Hemothorax: diminished breath sounds, respiratory distress, and hypotension.
Assess for any physical evidence of a possible thoracic injury during the secondary evaluation, which includes chest wall instability, ecchymosis, and hematoma formation. Keep in mind that the degree of external trauma does not correlate with the severity of internal injuries.
A detailed history and physical is necessary when assessing the patient’s risk for thoracic trauma.
A CXR is indicated as early in the work-up as possible if there is a significant injury mechanism, a suspected thoracic injury, or the patient’s initial evaluation is severely limited by his/her clinical status or intoxication/altered mental status.
While the specificity of a CXR is fairly high in patients with suspected thoracic trauma (up to 95%), its sensitivity remains low (67%), meaning that it must be interpreted with the patient’s probability of the disease in mind.
The role of a chest CT in patients with suspected thoracic trauma is more nuanced, and there are suggested clinical decision algorithms to help in determining a patient’s pretest probability of a thoracic injury and the subsequent need for this imaging modality.
The NEXUS Group has identified criteria for a chest CT. Incorporating these into the below decision tree can help determine who needs imaging and the appropriate imaging modality. 
The NEXUS CXR criteria have 99% sensitivity and include
Age >60 y
Rapid deceleration mechanism
Intoxication
Abnormal mental status
Distracting painful injury
Chest pain
Tenderness to chest wall palpation
The NEXUS chest CT rules for all injuries have a sensitivity of 99.2% and include the following criteria:
Distracting injury
Chest wall tenderness
Sternal tenderness
Thoracic spine tenderness
Scapular tenderness
Abnormal CXR
One final important consideration is the need for a CT angiogram of the chest to specifically evaluate for a vascular injury, which will be further discussed in the injury-based section of this chapter (Great Vessel Injury Initial Management).
Following ATLS guidelines, the patient’s initial management should be directed toward immediate life threats. These include
Airway: consider endotracheal intubation.
Breathing: needle or finger thoracostomy followed by a chest tube for clinical findings that suggest a tension pneumothorax or hemothorax.
Circulation: U/S evaluation of the heart (at minimum) to evaluate for tamponade and the need for a pericardiocentesis or an emergency thoracotomy.
After the ABCs have been addressed, the patient stabilized, and a secondary survey performed, the remainder of the initial management of blunt thoracic trauma varies depending on what injuries were identified, and will be further discussed in the Deep Dive section of this chapter.",Blunt Thoracic Trauma
"Deep Dive: Chest Wall Injuries
Figure
The chest wall includes the skin, bones, muscles, and ligaments that compose the thorax.
This part of the body is fairly rigid in adults. The bony thorax comprises the sternum, clavicles, scapulae, 12 ribs, and the thoracic spine.
The physiology required for normal thoracic function relies on the intricate workings of muscles, including the diaphragm, to create a negative pressure gradient that allows air to flow in and out of the lungs for adequate ventilation.
This largely depends on the chest wall as well as the diaphragm.
Injuries to the chest wall can range from contusions and hematomas to severe thoracic disruptions that require mechanical ventilation.
Rib Fractures
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Studies have shown that up to two-thirds of patients who are admitted for MVCs have rib fractures. 
Rib fractures usually occur following a direct, blunt force to the ribs.
The most common fracture site is at the point of impact. However, the weakest part of the rib is its posterolateral bend, which is also vulnerable to fracture as a result of significant chest wall compression.
Generally, fractures of the upper ribs are more commonly associated with the underlying injury, while fractures of the lower ribs may be associated with intra-abdominal trauma.
Displaced rib fractures are more likely to cause damage to the underlying pleural tissue or intercostal neurovascular bundle, resulting in a pulmonary contusion, laceration, or hemo-pneumothorax.
Rib fractures are particularly uncommon in pediatric patients because of the increased compliance of their chest wall and thoracic bony structures.
Pediatric rib fractures are therefore associated with a very high energy mechanism.
Diagnostic Considerations
When assessing the blunt trauma patient, pay close attention to his/her respiratory status, including both ventilation and oxygenation.
Rib fractures and injuries to the chest wall can result in splinting, short/shallow breaths, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
The patient will have pain with palpation over the fracture and may also have pain with chest wall compression at the fracture site.
Evaluate the chest for external evidence of trauma, although this is commonly not present.
A CXR can miss over 60% of rib fractures.  However, it can identify other injuries that are complications of rib fractures, such as a pneumothorax. Image Image
Dedicated rib series/views are rarely indicated and should only be obtained if this imaging will change the patient’s management.
A high suspicion for an isolated rib fracture or simple traumatic pneumothorax does not necessitate a CT scan of the chest if the patient is otherwise without suspicion of a more serious injury. The diagnosis of a clinical rib fracture with or without a hemo- or pneumothorax is appropriate.
A CT scan of the chest may be considered if the patient’s mechanism of injury or clinical exam is highly suggestive of a fracture and the results of this test are likely to change the patient’s management.
For example, if the patient is elderly, has multiple comorbidities, or has poorly controlled pain that has resulted in an inadequate respiratory effort, consider further imaging to characterize these injuries.
Therapeutic Considerations
If no other injuries are identified in the patient’s work-up, rib fractures are treated symptomatically.
Adequate pain control is essential, and may even require admission so as to permit as close to normal respiratory function as possible.
With appropriate pain control, the patient can aggressively utilize an incentive spirometer to combat the atelectasis and infection that would otherwise occur if they could not clear their secretions. 
Many institutions have an algorithm for admitting patients with rib fractures that factors in age, comorbidities, and pulmonary function.
Patients should be considered for admission if they have 3 or more rib fractures. 
Patients over the age of 45 y with more than 4 rib fractures are more severely injured and have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.  Therapeutic algorithms and admissions should therefore be geared towards this population.
Pain control options, many of which can be initiated in the ED, include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, local nerve blocks, and epidurals.
Sternal Fracture
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
The majority of the sternal fractures sustained in the U.S. are caused by automobile accidents.
One review of the National Trauma Data Bank demonstrated that 84% of sternal fractures were from automobile accidents. 
Restrained patients are more likely to sustain a sternal fracture than unrestrained patients because of over-the-shoulder seat belts.
More sternal fractures are now being diagnosed with the increased use of CT scans in trauma patients. 
Isolated sternal fractures are uncommon and have a low associated mortality rate.
Sternal fractures are often concomitant with other injuries that range from rib fractures and mediastinal hematomas to cardiac contusions, which result in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
Significantly displaced fractures can interrupt the normal mechanics of breathing, usually secondary to pain and subsequent splinting.
The sternum is more brittle in elderly patients, leading to an increased incidence of fractures in this population. In contrast, in younger patients, the energy imparted to the sternum is often translated to the underlying organs.
Sternal fractures are not specifically associated with an increased incidence of great vessel injuries. 
Diagnostic Considerations
The traditional teaching is that sternal fractures can be seen on a lateral CXR. However, CXRs have been proven on a number of occasions to have a very low specificity for sternal fractures.
The majority of trauma patients who receive a CXR receive a one-view, anterior-posterior (AP) X-ray, which is not at all sensitive or specific for sternal fractures.
In a large review study of patients who were diagnosed with a sternal fracture and received both a CXR and CT, 94% of fractures were visible only on CT. 
In cases in which there is a high suspicion for a sternal fracture or additional thoracic injuries, a CT scan is indicated, as outlined in the imaging guidelines in the “Diagnostic Considerations” section. Image
There is emerging literature to suggest that bedside U/S may be a reliable way to diagnose a sternal fracture. However, this is limited by the physician’s and/or sonographer’s experience with this modality.
If a sternal fracture is identified, the patient should always also have an ECG to assess for an underlying cardiac contusion.
Therapeutic Considerations
Similar to rib fractures, isolated sternal fractures require symptom control with pain medication in order to preserve normal breathing mechanics.
This will include NSAIDs if not contraindicated, and possibly opiate medications if the pain is severe.
With its relatively low morbidity and mortality, an isolated sternal fracture is usually safe for discharge.
However, as these fractures are often associated with other injuries, surgical consultation and admission are often indicated for other reasons.
Surgical intervention for a sternal fracture is rare. However, surgery may be indicated if there is significant displacement, overlying bone fragments that cause severe respiratory compromise, deformity, or pain. 
Costochondral Separation
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Costochondral separation is usually the result of a blunt anterior chest wall force, from either a steering wheel or a direct blow.
This occurs when the costochondral cartilage, where the rib interfaces with the sternum, is injured or torn.
There is poor vascular supply to this area, so healing may be protracted.
Severe separation can contribute to an anterior flail segment and affect normal respiratory mechanics.
Diagnostic Considerations
Costochondral separation is largely a clinical diagnosis.
Signs and symptoms will be similar to those of rib fractures.
Patients may feel a “snapping” sensation when they take a deep breath.
Most of the time, a CXR is normal in these patients, although it is still indicated to rule out other pathologies.
Therapeutic Considerations
Analgesia and symptom control with NSAIDs or other pain management medications may be indicated.
Treatment may require longer symptom control due to a prolonged healing time.
Flail Chest
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
A flail chest is defined as 3 or more adjacent ribs that are fractured at 2 points, creating a freely moving segment of the chest wall that results in paradoxical motion.
This can also occur following the combination of a costochondral separation and a rib fracture.
Flail chest is fairly rare, and its incidence increases with the number of involved ribs.
One study calculated the incidence of a flail chest in a patient with 6 rib fractures as 4%, which increases to 6.4% in patients with 8 or more rib fractures. 
As normal respiration requires an intact chest wall, the presence of a flail segment can significantly affect respiratory physiology.
As the patient inhales, the intact chest wall moves outward, whereas the flail segment moves inward. As the patient exhales, the opposite occurs.
This compromises the intrathoracic pressure change needed for effective ventilation.
A flail chest is also associated with many other injuries, particularly those to the pleura and lung tissue such as a pulmonary contusion or pneumothorax.
Diagnostic Considerations
A flail segment can often be identified in a patient who is breathing independently by evaluating for a segment of the chest wall that is moving paradoxically. EM:RAP Video
A flail chest on palpation feels like a depression in the chest wall, and will likely have associated crepitus.
If the patient is being ventilated, mechanical ventilation can “splint” the flail segment and make it harder to visualize.
Other signs and symptoms of a flail chest include chest wall pain, splinting, tachypnea, respiratory difficulty, and/or hypoxia.
While a CXR is typically not adequate for diagnosing isolated rib fractures due to its low sensitivity, a flail chest can often be identified on a single-view AP CXR.
If a flail segment is identified, a chest CT is often recommended to evaluate for additional thoracic injuries.
An ECG is also recommended in patients with a flail segment.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment focuses on pain management and potential underlying injuries.
Supplemental oxygen, respiratory support, and aggressive pain control are the mainstays of treatment.
These patients also require aggressive pulmonary toilet to maintain healthy lung tissue as the injury progresses.
As a flail segment is almost always associated with a pulmonary contusion and severely disrupted breathing mechanics, a surgical consult and admission are warranted, as a pulmonary contusion will typically develop over 48 h. 
Some centers will consider rib plating in patients with a severe flail segment to maintain respiratory mechanics and assist with pain control. Some studies have demonstrated the benefits of surgical fixation. 
Aggressive analgesia (eg, epidurals, nerve blocks, NSAIDs, and/or opioids) is recommended for patients with a flail segment.
If the patient’s breathing mechanics are so severely affected that normoxia cannot be maintained even with supplemental oxygen, intubation and PPV may be considered.
It is important to ensure there is no underlying pneumothorax or that it is addressed with a tube thoracostomy prior to initiating PPV in patients with a flail chest because the positive pressure can quickly convert the pneumothorax to tension physiology.
Some studies have demonstrated that continuous positive airway pressure is a successful alternative to endotracheal intubation in patients who require PPV,  and this may be considered, assuming again that there is no underlying pneumothorax.
Traumatic Asphyxia
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Traumatic asphyxia, also called Perte’s syndrome, is a very rare crush injury to the chest that is mostly discussed in case reports.
It is caused by severe thoracic compression, usually by machinery or a heavy object, that profoundly restricts ventilation and increases intrathoracic pressure.
Increased thoracic pressure leads to retrograde flow from the right heart into the great veins of the head and neck. Photo Photo
Diagnostic Considerations
Patients with traumatic asphyxia will demonstrate exam findings associated with increased venous pressure (eg, deep violet skin, subconjunctival hemorrhage, petechiae, and sometimes facial edema). 
Diagnostically, history and injury mechanism are the best indications of this sort of injury.
It is important to look for underlying or additional injuries that may have occurred as a result of this significant mechanism.
The force and mechanism associated with traumatic asphyxia usually warrants a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. 
A head CT may be considered if the patient also has associated neurologic complaints.
If the crush is prolonged, the patient may suffer from cerebral anoxia.
Therapeutic Considerations
Supplemental oxygen and possibly mechanical ventilation are the main treatment foci for traumatic asphyxia.
Patients may also have multiple other injuries, such as rib fractures or pneumothoraces. Chest decompression with a thoracostomy may be indicated as other injuries are identified.",Blunt Thoracic Trauma
"Deep Dive: Pulmonary Injuries
The thoracic cage exists to protect the cardiopulmonary anatomy that lies within it.
Following thoracic trauma, pulmonary injuries can occur to the lung parenchyma, pleura, or the tracheobronchial system, and can exist without significant external chest wall trauma.
Pulmonary vascular injuries are mainly the result of penetrating thoracic trauma.
A large hemothorax or pneumothorax can result in tension physiology, be life threatening, and require immediate intervention during the primary survey by means of a needle or finger decompression or a tube thoracostomy.
Pulmonary Contusion
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Pulmonary contusions exist in 30% to 75% of patients who sustain significant chest trauma.  Image
This occurs as the kinetic energy from the injury is translated to the lung tissue, thereby initiating an inflammatory cascade that results in capillary leak and interstitial edema, ultimately resulting in ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.
Subsequent excessive mucus production and capillary leakage can result in an injury pattern that extends beyond the tissue that was initially damaged.
This inflammatory response is not immediate. The severity of a pulmonary contusion often progresses over time (48-72 h).
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinically, a patient with a pulmonary contusion will likely demonstrate shortness of breath and tachypnea.
If the injury is severe and causes a significant V/Q mismatch, the patient may also have tachycardia, hypotension, and/or hypoxia that typically peaks 72 h after the injury. 
On exam, the patient may (or may not) have an external chest wall injury or a flail segment, crackles, or absent breath sounds.
A CXR can diagnose a pulmonary contusion. It is usually visible shortly after the injury, although there may be a delay of up to 6 h as the contusion “blossoms.”
CXR findings include a patchy and irregular infiltrate or consolidation, usually isolated to the injured lobe.
Contusions can also be identified and/or characterized with a CT scan of the chest.
Advanced-generation CT scans often identify more subtle contusions that are not visible on CXR.
The clinical significance of pulmonary contusions that are deemed “CT-only” (ie, not visible on CXR) is questionable, and the literature suggests that those patients will have a better outcome overall. 
CT scans can help to stratify patients and the severity of their contusion by better characterizing the extent and location of lung damage.
Some providers use scoring systems to predict patient outcomes based on the volume of damaged tissue identified by the CT scan.  Image Image Image
In laboratory studies, low partial pressures of oxygen on arterial blood gas in the setting of blunt thoracic trauma may suggest a pulmonary contusion.
Therapeutic Considerations
Oxygenation is the mainstay of pulmonary contusion treatment.
In severely injured patients with significant respiratory compromise, mechanical ventilation may be considered.
If there is significant alveolar hemorrhage or edema in a single lung from a contusion, then single lung intubation with bronchial blockers may be indicated to manage the mismatch by selectively ventilating the uninjured lung. 
The use of non-invasive PPV in patients with pulmonary contusions is becoming increasingly common and should be considered if there are no contraindications. 
Mechanical ventilation and intubation should be avoided when possible to avoid associated morbidity. 
Fluid resuscitation is heavily debated in the literature. It is largely felt that excessive colloid administration can worsen the pulmonary edema that results from capillary leakage. Current recommendations are to minimize IV fluid administration when possible in patients with pulmonary contusions. 
Pain control, aggressive pulmonary toilet including encouraged coughing, and early mobility all help patients with pulmonary contusions, and supportive care is the basis of treatment for those patients who do not require more aggressive ventilatory management.
Pulmonary contusions seen on a chest CT but not on a CXR may not need any additional therapy beyond what is indicated based on the patient’s symptoms and other injuries. 
Pulmonary Laceration
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Occurs when the lung parenchyma is lacerated; it is more common following penetrating trauma.
Can also occur following blunt trauma when a broken rib lacerates the lung tissue.
Usually results in minor bleeding. However, if severe, it can result in a tension hemothorax.
Diagnostic Considerations
A patient with a pulmonary laceration may complain of chest pain, shortness of breath, tachypnea, and tachycardia.
On CXR, hemothorax, the sequela of a pulmonary laceration, may be visible.
A pulmonary laceration is often diagnosed surgically after a thoracotomy has been performed based on direct inspection of the lung tissue.
Therapeutic Considerations
The treatment of a pulmonary laceration involves managing its sequelae. If the laceration causes a large or tension hemothorax, this should be treated with a chest tube.
Treatment should also be aimed at the underlying cause, which typically involves the treatment of the rib fractures or flail segment that caused the laceration.
Pneumothorax
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
The incidence of pneumothorax after chest trauma ranges widely in the literature, from 6% to 60%. 
There are three categories of pneumothorax: simple, communicating, and tension.
A simple pneumothorax does not communicate with the outside atmosphere.
A communicating pneumothorax is associated with a defect in the chest wall.
Very common following penetrating chest trauma versus a blunt injury.
A tension pneumothorax is the progressive accumulation of air in the pleural space that ultimately shifts the mediastinum, compresses the great vessels, decreases cardiac output, and results in shock/hemodynamic instability.
Pneumothoraces following blunt trauma are typically caused by a rib fracture that punctures the pleura or from rapid compression that results in alveolar rupture (eg, if the impact occurs while the patient is inhaling).
The pleural space is a potential space. As air accumulates, it can cause compression and subsequent atelectasis of lung tissue, impairing respiratory function.
If there is communication with the atmosphere, the negative pressure generated by normal respiratory function may act as a “one-way valve” that allows air to accumulate in the space but does not allow it to exit, ultimately leading to tension physiology.
Similarly, if there is no communication with the atmosphere and the patient is on PPV, the air may be “forced” into the pleural space via the ruptured alveoli without a way to exit, thereby turning a simple pneumothorax into a tension pneumothorax.
Diagnostic Considerations
The clinical presentation of a patient with a traumatic pneumothorax depends on the extent of the pneumothorax and its associated respiratory and cardiopulmonary sequelae.
A patient with a simple pneumothorax may have no symptoms or may complain of some mild shortness of breath or chest pain.
A patient with a tension pneumothorax will be in severe respiratory distress and will often present with hypoxia and hypotension with tracheal deviation and absent breath sounds.
While CXR is the initial imaging of choice for many trauma patients, studies have shown that small pneumothoraces may be missed on initial AP supine radiography in 30%-50% of trauma patients. 
If possible, an upright CXR is more specific that supine imaging in identifying a pneumothorax. However, this is often limited due to spinal immobilization or other traumatic injuries. Image
A CT is much more specific at diagnosing a pneumothorax. However, not all trauma patients are stable enough to be transported to the CT scanner.
Bedside U/S has been shown to be more sensitive than a flat AP chest radiograph in the diagnosis of a traumatic pneumothorax. 
The diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax is clinical and should not require radiography prior to intervention (ie, tube thoracostomy or needle decompression).
However, if captured on CXR, a tension pneumothorax will demonstrate tracheal deviation, midline shift, and the absence of lung markings on the injured side.
Therapeutic Considerations
The treatment of pneumothorax depends on its size and the additional injuries associated with the trauma.
Patients with a tension pneumothorax require the most rapid treatment, which involves immediate decompression with a needle or chest tube.
Needle decompression should be performed with a 14-gauge or larger needle.
The needle can be placed either in the 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line, or in the 4th or 5th intercostal space at the midaxillary line.
Site choice depends on patient habitus and access to the patient.
This intervention may be performed during the primary trauma survey as breathing is assessed.
Moderate to large pneumothoraces require chest tube placement.
A chest tube should also be placed if the patient requires PPV and has a known pneumothorax, as the PPV can convert a simple pneumothorax to tension physiology very quickly.
Chest tube size is somewhat controversial. However, recent literature suggests that for a traumatic pneumothorax, a 20-22 Fr chest tube has no different efficacy than a larger (28 Fr) tube. 
Tube size has also been shown to not change the amount of pain felt by the patient, so the most recent literature would suggest that a smaller chest tube is likely sufficient in the treatment of a traumatic pneumothorax. 
In patients with a small, simple pneumothorax (<15%), observe the patient for 6 h and repeat the CXR.
If there is no increase in the size of the pneumothorax, the patient can be safely discharged home.
If there is an increase in the size of the pneumothorax, depending on the degree of this change, a chest tube may be indicated versus admission for additional observation.
Hemothorax
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
A hemothorax occurs when blood accumulates in the pleural space.
A patient can lose a significant portion of their blood volume into each hemithorax, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock, tension physiology, or death.
A hemothorax is typically caused by injured lung parenchyma, vascular bundles from broken ribs, or other injured blood vessels in the thoracic cavity that communicate with the pleural space.
Specific common culprits are the intercostal vessels and the internal mammary arteries.
The risk of a hemothorax (or pneumothorax) increases as the number of rib fractures increases, with one study noting that 81.4% of patients developed a hemo- or pneumothorax following the fracture of two or more ribs. 
Diagnostic Considerations
On physical exam, patients with a hemothorax may have pain, shortness of breath, and hemodynamic instability if the injury is severe.
Hypotension in a patient with a hemothorax may be from hemorrhagic shock, tension physiology, or both.
A CXR is often the initial diagnostic step in the blunt trauma patient. Similar to a pneumothorax, this would ideally be an upright CXR.
Any blunting of the costophrenic angle equates to about 200 mL of blood in the hemothorax. 
If the patient is supine, CXR findings may include vague opacities in the pleural space spread over the entire hemithorax due to the layering of blood.
Bedside U/S findings may reveal a pleural effusion above the diaphragm or the absence of sliding in patients with a pneumothorax. The sensitivity and specificity of U/S in the detection of a hemothorax remains below an acceptable level. 
CT is able to detect very small hemothoraces that may be present, especially if the patient received a chest CT to further evaluate traumatic injuries.
Therapeutic Considerations
The majority of hemothoraces can be managed with a tube thoracostomy.
The traditional management of a hemothorax is to place a large-bore (36-40 Fr) chest tube.
However, more recent literature suggests that a traumatic hemothorax or pneumothorax can be managed with smaller (28-32 Fr) chest tubes, even those as small as 20-22 Fr. 
Another mainstay of hemothorax treatment is managing blood loss. If autotransfusion is available, this would be an indication for such.
Otherwise, blood transfusion is indicated in patients with hemorrhagic shock to restore perfusion and blood volume after significant blood loss from a hemothorax.
Nearly all hemothoraces require a chest tube, as studies have shown that their insertion decreases the rate of subsequent scarring and empyema.  EM:RAP Video Image Image
Tracheobronchial Injury
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Tracheobronchial tree injuries are rare after trauma and are found in fewer than 3% of patients who suffer a thoracic injury. 
They usually occur following a direct blow to the chest, a shearing injury, or a blast injury, and are most often caused by MVCs or a crush mechanism.
Most tracheobronchial injuries occur within 2 cm of the tracheal carina, and are defined as either communicating with the pleural space with a resultant pneumothorax or non-communicating.
Diagnostic Considerations
On exam, patients with a tracheobronchial injury may have crepitus or subcutaneous emphysema.
If a patient has a chest tube, a persistent and massive air leak through the chest tube may indicate a large airway injury.
Pneumomediastinum may result in a “Hamman’s crunch”: auscultated crackles with each heartbeat.
A pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax may suggest an airway injury, although no finding is diagnostic.
CT of the chest may also demonstrate secondary signs of injury, with one study detecting the site of injury in 94% of cases. 
However, if there is a high clinical suspicion for an airway injury, bronchoscopy is the gold standard.
Therapeutic Considerations
The majority of tracheobronchial injuries need to be treated surgically.
Ideally, if the patient requires intubation, this will be done over a bronchoscope so as to not perpetuate the injury and be sure that the tube is placed past the injured area.
Certain patients may be considered for close observation with conservative management, such as those with a minimal mediastinal or subcutaneous air leak without a pneumothorax who do not require positive pressure intubation.",Blunt Thoracic Trauma
"Deep Dive: Cardiovascular Trauma
Following blunt trauma with a significant high-energy mechanism, damage to the heart and great vessels must be considered.
MVCs are the most common cause of thoracic cardiovascular injury.
Many severe cardiac and great vessel injuries cause nearly immediate death, making their presentation to the ED rare. However, this also emphasizes the importance of accurate and prompt diagnosis of these injuries.
While the diagnostic evaluation protocol for blunt thoracic aortic injury is widely agreed upon, how to evaluate for a myocardial injury varies widely.
Ultimately, a blunt cardiac injury results from either a structural impairment (eg, pericardial tamponade from a free wall rupture, cardiogenic shock from a valve rupture, or myocardial infarction from a coronary artery injury) or direct myocardial cell dysfunction following a contusion or concussion (eg, dysrhythmia, congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock).
Pericardial Tamponade
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Acute pericardial tamponade is more common following penetrating thoracic trauma but can occasionally be seen following blunt thoracic trauma.
It is one of the few potentially treatable causes of death following blunt thoracic trauma.
It is caused by bleeding from the myocardium or a vessel into intact pericardium, or from a myocardial wall rupture that results in increased pressure within the pericardium, ultimately preventing the filling of the heart during diastole and cardiopulmonary arrest from myocardial failure.
If a pericardial tamponade is caused by a myocardial wall rupture, it is most commonly from a rupture of the atrial appendage (see the “Myocardial Rupture” section).
Diagnostic Considerations
eFAST, part of the standard initial work-up, can easily identify a pericardial effusion after trauma, and with an appropriate view one can see tamponade physiology with right ventricular collapse.
A very early sign before tamponade physiology develops is tachycardia. However, this is a very non-specific finding in trauma patients.
These patients classically will have muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distention, and hypotension.
Pericardial tamponade is sometimes identified upon the completion of an ED thoracotomy for a traumatic arrest.
Therapeutic Considerations
See Chapter: Pericardiocentesis
Initial management should focus on volume resuscitation in an attempt to increase preload and maintain cardiac function and contractility.
If a patient has hemodynamic instability and evidence of a pericardial effusion/tamponade on U/S, a pericardial window or pericardiocentesis may be considered.
An ED thoracotomy may be performed and, if tamponade is identified, then the heart needs to be delivered from the pericardium.
This can be completed by identifying the phrenic nerve and making a cut with blunt-tipped scissors into just the pericardium, evacuating the blood, and removing the pericardium from the myocardium.
Blunt Myocardial Injury
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
The term “blunt myocardial injury” encompasses a wide range of injuries to the heart (eg, myocardial concussion, contusion, and infarction) that lead to impaired cardiac function.
It can involve any cardiac structural element from the electrical conduction system, myocardial cells, and coronary arteries/valves.
The majority of cardiac injuries are the result of an MVC, as a rapid deceleration (eg, the chest hits the steering wheel) is thought to generate a significant blunt force when the heart strikes the internal bony thorax.
Although not more prevalent than a cardiac contusion, the most common and immediately life-threatening structural injury to the heart is rupture of the right ventricle, given its weak anterior wall.
Myocardial concussion, or commotio cordis, refers to acute blunt cardiac trauma that stuns the myocardial cells and conduction system, resulting in dysrhythmia and myocardial dysfunction.
This may be brief and self-limited or can result in a fatal dysrhythmia and death.
Diagnostic Considerations
The diagnostic pathway for a non-structural blunt cardiac injury remains a subject of debate in the literature.
Most studies agree that if there is a high suspicion for a cardiac contusion or concussion (eg, following a significant deceleration mechanism or crush injury, or in the setting of severe chest pain, significant external evidence of trauma, or hemodynamic instability), then an ECG should be obtained.
Clinically, a patient will likely have chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness associated with an injury to the myocardium or electrical conduction system.
The value of biomarkers remains debatable, but if a patient has a normal ECG with negative cardiac biomarkers, then a blunt cardiac injury can effectively be ruled out. 
Regarding abnormal ECG findings following a blunt cardiac injury, sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are the most common findings, while ST segment changes and bundle branch blocks can also be present.
An echocardiogram may be useful in identifying wall-motion abnormalities in severely injured myocardium and to evaluate for a pericardial effusion.
When there is significant concern for a blunt cardiac injury, admission for observation on telemetry is indicated.
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment strategies aim to avoid potential severe complications and control ongoing symptoms.
There is no established indication for dysrhythmia prophylaxis because most dysrhythmias, if they do occur, are self-limited.
Given that many patients with a blunt myocardial injury have other concomitant thoracoabdominal injuries, aspirin and heparin are often contraindicated.
It is important to be judicious with IV fluids in these patients, as heart failure may be precipitated by overzealous fluid administration.
The most pressing and urgent assessment of patients with suspected blunt myocardial injury is for blood in the pericardial space that can contribute to hemodynamic instability.
The cardiac view of an initial FAST exam should be of particular interest.
Myocardial Rupture
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
This occurs when a portion of the heart ruptures (ie, the atria, ventricles, or valves).
It is almost uniformly fatal when it does occur, and accounts for 15% of fatal thoracic injuries.
One proposed mechanism behind a myocardial rupture is an indirect, fast, and strong increase in preload that results in increased intracardiac pressure.
An alternative etiology involves a direct, blunt blow to the myocardium against the sternum or spine, resulting in rupture. 
The heart is at particular risk if the injury occurs when the chambers are full at end-diastole.
Cardiac injury as the sole cause of death is most commonly from the transmural rupture of at least one of the cardiac chambers, with the right ventricle being the most common (40% of victims). 
Rupture can also occur at the site of the venous-atrial confluence after a deceleration injury.
Diagnostic Considerations
Patients who have sustained a myocardial rupture often do not make it to the emergency room.
However, if the myocardium ruptures and the pericardium remains intact, pericardial tamponade may be seen on the initial FAST bedside U/S.
Physical or U/S exam findings suggestive of tamponade are imperative for the immediate identification of a myocardial rupture.
If a valve, papillary muscle, or chordae tendineae is ruptured, a new murmur and evidence of acute heart failure may be present on the secondary exam.
Injuries will need to be definitively identified with an echocardiogram.
Therapeutic Considerations
In cases where a myocardial rupture leads to a pericardial tamponade, a pericardiocentesis is indicated if time and patient condition permit.
If the patient is pulseless, an emergency thoracotomy is indicated if it is within the accepted time frame for such a procedure and the institution has the resources in place to manage the patient through the operative repair.
Immediate surgical repair is necessary once an injury is identified.
If a surgeon is not immediately available, a thoracotomy with direct repair using large buttressed vicryl suture, staples, or direct occlusion with a finger or Foley catheter may be performed to stabilize the patient until definitive treatment is possible.
Blunt Aortic Injury
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
A blunt aortic injury is most commonly caused by a deceleration injury, with multiple proposed physiologic mechanisms.
80% of patients with aortic injuries die in the field. 
A blunt aortic injury should be considered in every patient who has sustained a severe deceleration injury, as 30% of patients who sustain an aortic injury and make it to the hospital will die within 24 h.
The most common site of an aortic injury is just distal to the left subclavian artery at the aortic isthmus.
Injuries can include intimal tears or hematomas, but those patients who make it to the ED usually have an intact adventitial layer (outermost layer) but are at a very high risk of imminent rupture.
Diagnostic Considerations
There is no “classic” clinical presentation for patients with an acute traumatic aortic injury. In fact, stable vital signs may not reliably rule out such an injury.
Chest pain radiating to the back is only present in 25% of patients with traumatic aortic injuries. 
The clinical presentation of patients with blunt aortic injuries is widely variable, as they often present with additional injuries from significant trauma. However, the specific symptoms of a blunt aortic injury can also be clinically “silent.” 
Some clinical features that may be present include:
Chest pain
Absent/diminished/asymmetric pulses
A new murmur
Thus, if there is a significant mechanism of injury (eg, deceleration injury) and clinical suspicion, diagnostic tests should be performed.
CXR is almost always the first imaging modality, and should be performed during the initial trauma work-up.
Patients with a low probability of traumatic aortic injury and a negative CXR do not require additional evaluation.
Up to 7% of patients who have an aortic injury or rupture will have no mediastinal abnormality on their CXR. 
CXR findings that may indicate a possible aortic injury include: 
Widened mediastinum
Obscured aortic knob
Opacification of the clear space between the aorta and pulmonary artery
Widened paratracheal stripe
Displaced nasogastric (NG) tube/deviation of the NG tube to the right
Depression of the left mainstem bronchus
A chest CT with IV contrast is the standard diagnostic test for a blunt aortic injury. Figure
Therapeutic Considerations
Surgical or endovascular repair is the ultimate treatment for a traumatic aortic injury once the injury is discovered.
If there is a delay in surgical repair (eg, due to the management of other life-threatening injuries), tight blood pressure control with esmolol with a goal systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mm Hg is required.
Nitroprusside can be added as a second blood pressure control agent if needed, but care should be taken not to induce a reflex tachycardia that may increase aortic wall stress and jeopardize the stability of the rupture.",Blunt Thoracic Trauma
"Deep Dive: Other Injuries
Esophageal Injury
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
Esophageal injuries following blunt thoracic trauma are exceedingly rare and are almost never isolated injuries.
Early diagnosis and treatment is essential. A delayed diagnosis of over 24 h is almost universally fatal.
The most common site of esophageal injury following blunt trauma is at its cervical and upper thoracic portion. 
Diagnostic Considerations
Clinically, esophageal injuries can initially be subtle and easy to miss, especially as they are often associated with multiple other injuries that can distract the patient or provider.
Pain is the most common symptom. Additional symptoms include fever, dyspnea, and crepitus (decreasing frequency in this order). 
Since the cervical esophagus is the most commonly injured portion in patients who have sustained a blunt trauma, neck pain is a common clinical complaint.
Depending on the location of the injury, physical exam may reveal “Hamman’s crunch” due to mediastinal air, or palpable crepitus from air in the subcutaneous tissues of the neck or chest wall.
Radiographically, a CXR is abnormal in up to 90% of patients with thoracic esophageal injuries and most often demonstrates a pneumomediastinum, pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening. 
As with many thoracic injuries, a CT scan of the chest can also help identify esophageal injuries. Findings include extraluminal air, esophageal thickening, and, if oral contrast is used, extraluminal contrast.
Contrast imaging can significantly help in the diagnosis and delineation of esophageal perforations. However, which contrast material to use is of continued debate in the literature.
Barium can lead to better imaging. However, if it leaks into the mediastinum it can worsen the inflammatory response.
Gastrografin is safer but less specific in identifying extravasation. Further, if aspirated, gastrografin can cause severe pneumonitis and pulmonary edema. 
Therapeutic Considerations
Esophageal injuries can be severe and carry a very high risk of morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true if they go undiagnosed or if there is a delay in their diagnosis and treatment, as the resulting mediastinitis can lead to sepsis and death.
The majority of esophageal injuries are operative and require an emergency surgical consultation or transfer to a capable facility.
Other treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic depends on the location of the perforation.
In the cervical esophagus, the antibiotic regimen should cover oral flora.
In the thoracic esophagus, coverage should be aimed at both oral and gastrointestinal flora.
Regardless of whether the patient is going to be managed operatively or non-operatively, antibiotics, admission, pain control, and NPO status are essential aspects of the management of esophageal injuries.
Diaphragm Injuries
Epidemiology and Pathophysiology
A diaphragmatic injury occurs in 0.5%-6% of major thoracic trauma patients. However, these injuries are likely underdiagnosed at initial presentation. 
Diaphragm injury usually occurs after a significant blunt force to the abdomen, such as in an MVC or a fall from a height, which increases the intra-abdominal pressure and ruptures a weak portion of the diaphragm. This permits the herniation of vital organs through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity.
70%-80% of diaphragmatic ruptures occur on the left side of the diaphragm, as the liver is thought to be protective on the right. 
Diagnostic Considerations
The signs and symptoms of a diaphragmatic injury are often overlooked because of the high likelihood of other more severe and notable thoracoabdominal injuries.
Patients may present with shortness of breath, referred shoulder pain, abdominal pain, or vomiting.
Bowel sounds may be auscultated when listening to the lungs.
CXR findings are often non-specific and include an elevated hemidiaphragm, an irregular diaphragm contour, a pleural effusion, or NG tube coiling in the left chest (indicating herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity).
If the CXR shows abdominal contents in the chest cavity, it can confirm the diagnosis in 90% of traumatic diaphragmatic injuries.  Image
A CT scan is 95% sensitive if the acute herniation of abdominal contents is observed, but in their absence many injuries are missed.  Image
Therapeutic Considerations
Treatment of an acute diaphragmatic hernia that is diagnosed is operative.
An undiagnosed or untreated diaphragmatic hernia can lead to the necrosis of incarcerated bowel.",Blunt Thoracic Trauma
